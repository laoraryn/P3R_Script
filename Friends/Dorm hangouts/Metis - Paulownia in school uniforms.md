Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, there you are, Aigis! Do you have a minute?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Exasperated* - Metis wanted me to pass on a message to you. Um...
She said she wanted to show you something and asked if you could come to Paulownia Mall.

Understood.
This is rather sudden.
How suspicious...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, perfect!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oops... Sorry, I just got a little too excited.
Happy - Anyway, you should get going. She's been waiting for you.

Aigis - Thoughts
At Fuuka-san's insistence,
I made my way to Paulownia Mall.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Exasperated* - Oh, well, um, it's, er—


Fuuka Yamagishi
Exasperated* - I-I don't think she's up to anything... N-Not anything bad, at least?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I'm sure she just wants to spend time with you! At least, that's my impression.
So you should go and see her. She's been waiting for you for a while now.

Aigis - Thoughts
After being pressured by Fuuka-san,
I ended up going to Paulownia Mall...

===============================================================================================

Aigis - Thoughts
Metis asked to meet with me,
but I don't see her anywhere...

Metis's Voice
Sisteeerrr!

Metis
Surprised - Apologies for the wait— Oh! I mean...

Metis
Happy - Sorry, did I keep you waiting?

top - SEL_004_0_0
Yes, you did.
I just got here.
What did you need?

Metis
Sad - Oh... I'm so sorry. I should've known better—that was rude of me.
Sad - I was under the impression that I was observing proper etiquette... I must have been mistaken.

Metis
Happy - Ooh, you actually said it! According to proper etiquette, that's the correct response!

Metis
Surprised - Huh? That's not in the script. Did I not follow proper etiquette?

Metis
Happy - I read a book at the dorm that illustrated how two people in uniform rendezvous.

Metis
Happy - Is it not custom for those of similar age to don matching clothes and do all sorts of activities together?
Happy - I thought it'd be a shame should these outfits only be associated with exploration and combat...
Happy - So I was hoping the two of us could make some more pleasant memories in them while we still have the chance.

top - SEL_010_0_0
That's a wonderful idea.
Should I have worn mine?

Metis
Happy - You really think so? Well, in that case...
Happy - You should wear your uniform, too! No, you must! Please!

Aigis - Thoughts
Faced with Metis's enthusiasm,
I returned to the dorm to change
into my school uniform...

Metis
Happy - Y-You really don't mind!?
Happy - I mean, yes! Please do! I'll wait right here while you go get changed!

Aigis - Thoughts
Metis was vibrating with excitement
as she saw me off to the dorm...

Metis
Very happy* - ...Is this what true bliss feels like?

Metis
Angry - Now that we're finally matching, I can't afford to squander even a single second of our time together!
Angry - We must hurry and seize the opportunity to make new memories!
Please take the lead, Sister. What kinds of things are supposed to be done in school uniforms?

top - SEL_017_0_0
Studying to gain knowledge.
Drinking coffee to refine charisma.
Singing karaoke to build tenacity.

Metis
I see—you are a student, after all. So the real thrill of wearing a uniform isn't from going out and having fun with friends...
Happy - I learned something new today! Okay then, let's head back to the dorm and study there!

Aigis - Thoughts
I decided to head back
home with Metis.
In the end, all we did was talk
instead of studying, but Metis
still seemed very satisfied...

Metis
Surprised - So students drink coffee... to refine themselves? Does it make their skin smoother or something?
Happy - I also want to polish and refine myself for your sake, so I hope drinking coffee works for me, too!

Metis
Surprised - I wasn't sure what to make of karaoke, but... If it requires tenacity, doesn't that mean it's dangerous?
Happy - Is the mundane world a more hazardous place than I had originally thought...? What a surprising discovery.

Metis
Happy - Well then, no time to waste! Let's get going.

Metis
Very happy* - Just me and my sister—in our school uniforms!

Aigis - Thoughts
We spent time at Paulownia Mall
until Metis was fully satisfied...

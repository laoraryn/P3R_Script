Happy - Daaamn... These fights got me on the edge of my seat!
Don't see much I could use in an actual battle, though.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Also, why the heck would you guard and run from the opponent here? Makes zero sense.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Yo, perfect timing, Sanada-san! Mind if I pick your brain a bit?

Akihiko Sanada
I see... So you're wondering why this guy didn't just follow up with another attack instead?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - I mean, look! His opponent's pretty much cornered, right? Don't get why you'd just back off after that.

Akihiko Sanada
Well, I don't think it's a bad tactic at all. Seems obvious enough to me that he's getting baited.

Akihiko Sanada
He's letting himself get hit on purpose—

probably because he's setting up a trap.
What would you do here, Aigis? Would you still charge ahead, fists flying, when you know it's a trap?

I would analyze the situation.
I would overpower the target.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Heh. Guess we're on the same page, then.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Seriously, you guys? C'mon, the answer's obvious: Go in guns blazing!

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Oh yeah? I'd believe that.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Right? I'm with Ai-chan on this, man.

Junpei Iori
Happy - After all, the best defense is a good offense. You just gotta turn the tables and all that jazz!

Akihiko Sanada
Exasperated* - Junpei, you're gonna get yourself killed one of these days with that thinking.
Exasperated* - What if you meet your match one day? You've gotta be realistic.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Well, yeah, but... I-It's just...
Surprised - Goin' in for a one-hit KO is one heck of a power move!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Don't you agree, Ai-chan?

I think I do...
I don't quite follow...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Hell yeah! You get me!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Really!? Personally, I think an ultimate attack is the one thing every good hero needs in their arsenal.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Well... If that's how you really feel, then you better work hard and see it through.
Happy - Not like there's only one way to get stronger. You're just walking a different path from some of us, is all.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Sanada-san...

Aigis - Thoughts
Junpei-san appears to have
overcome an internal struggle...

Akihiko Sanada
Anyway... Show me where your path to strength takes you, Junpei, in our next battle.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Uhhh... I just wanted to talk about killer moves and ultimate attacks, though?

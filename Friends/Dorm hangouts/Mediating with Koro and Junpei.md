Aigis - Thoughts
Koromaru-san seems content
gnawing on the .

Koromaru
Angry - Grrr...

Koromaru
Angry - Woof, woof!

Aigis - Thoughts
Is something happening...?

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - Then let me make this clear: you may be our ally for now, but I don't have a single ounce of trust in you!

Metis
Angry - Oh, trust me, you were already perfectly clear! You made it clear just by how you treat me!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - C'mon, guys! Let's just all take a deep breath...

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Uhh...

Junpei Iori
Sad - Hey, Aigis... I still exist, right?

Of course you do.
Maybe you don't...

Junpei Iori
Sad - Thank you! I wasn't so sure with them actin' like I ain't even here...

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - Yeah, I guess not... That'd explain why they're actin' like they don't hear anything I say...

Junpei Iori
Sad - I don't know what started it, but they've been at it since I got here.

Junpei Iori
Horrified - Whoa, hey! I don't think you wanna get in the middle of this, buddy!

Koromaru
Woof!

Metis
Angry - What!? I'm not being childish at all! I'm just as grown-up as anyone else here!

Akihiko Sanada
Exasperated* - ...I can't believe a dog had to point out I'm getting too worked up...
All right, enough's enough. I admit that I'm at fault here too. Let's leave it at that.

Metis
Hmph... Fine.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Damn... One bark and it's settled!
Surprised - You're freakin' amazing, Koromaru!

Koromaru
*pant* *pant*

Well done, Koromaru-san!
What a commanding presence!

Koromaru
Happy - Arf!

Aigis - Thoughts
I can feel a dignified aura
emanating from Koromaru-san...

Junpei Iori
Sad - If this all proved anything, it's that nothin' can beat that Koromaru charm! I bet I could learn a thing or two from him.
Exasperated* - Wait a minute...
Looking away - I basically just said I'm less charming than a dog, didn't I...?

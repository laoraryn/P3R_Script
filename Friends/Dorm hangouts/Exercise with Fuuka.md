Sad - The title made it sound like this would be easy, but it sure doesn't feel easy to me...
Sad - Working out is hard... And I didn't know it required so much thinking too...

Just take your time.
You can think less.
We all have our weaknesses.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - You're right... If I rush, I'll only be making it harder on myself.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - But... Won't thinking less make it even more difficult?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - That... might be true, but...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Honestly... I was thinking I might be able to provide better support if I knew more about physical exertion.
Like, if I knew how to break a fall to minimize injury, I could direct everyone with that information in mind.
But it turns out just moving your body isn't anywhere near as straightforward as I thought it would be.
Exasperated* - Of course it wouldn't be that easy... I'm so stupid...

You're not stupid at all.
Just try something else.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Hehe... Thanks, Aigis.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Yeah... If this isn't working, I'll just need to find something that will.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Now that I think about it... It's also possible that some knowledge might be useless right now, but could end up coming in handy later.
Happy - I'll see what else I can come up with.

Good luck.
You seem very motivated.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Hehe, thanks.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Of course! Everyone else is fighting their hardest, so I want to as well.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - You know... Sometimes, I hate that I get to just safely give support while everyone else fights on the front lines.
Sad - But beating myself up about it isn't going to change anything.
Angry - That's why I want to do anything I can, even if it only helps out a little.

Aigis - Thoughts
I can sense Fuuka-san's
unyielding determination...

Fuuka Yamagishi
First, I think I'll try rewatching this video again.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, and please keep letting me know if you see my elbows start to bend, okay?

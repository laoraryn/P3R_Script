Yukari Takeba
Is something the matter, Amada-kun? Everyone's heading back now.

Ken Amada
Surprised - Sorry, I got distracted. There's just a lot on my mind...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Yeah, I know. It's a lot to take in, but you don't have to think so hard about it.
Happy - All we can do is keep exploring, so let's just focus on the road ahead of us.

Yukari Takeba
I know how you feel, but... All we can do is focus on exploring.
We don't have any other choice.

Ken Amada
Sad - Is that really true, though?

Ken Amada
I mean, this place is a reflection of our own minds, right?
Something tells me that it's going to take more than just exploration to get out of here.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Amada-kun...

Ken Amada
Sad - I want to understand why all of this is happening. How did we end up here?

Yukari Takeba
Looking away - ...Maybe you're right.

Ken Amada
Surprised - Sorry, I didn't mean for it to sound like you were in the wrong!

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Nah, don't worry about it. Honestly, you made a really good point.
Happy - Anyway, we're a team, right? It's important for us to speak our minds like this.

Ken Amada
...Yeah, I agree.
Sad - I'm not very good at it, though. I have a bad habit of keeping things like this bottled up...
I didn't have anyone I could talk to before, but... It's different now.

Ken Amada
Happy - I have to remember—I'm not alone anymore.
Happy - Thank you, Yukari-san.

Yukari Takeba
Looking away - I didn't even do anything, though...

Ken Amada
Happy - I wouldn't say that! I actually feel a lot better after talking to you. Anyway, I'll head back now and prep for our next trip.

Yukari Takeba
Looking away - ...Things are different now, huh.
Looking away - ......
Looking away - I'm not alone, either. I know that, but...

Yukari Takeba
Oh... It's starting to make sense.
I'm not just on edge...

Yukari Takeba
Looking away - All this time, I've been hurting inside...

Yukari Takeba
...I better head back. There's no time to dwell on this right now.

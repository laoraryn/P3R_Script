Mr. Edogawa
Happy - What brings you to the nurse's office? Eeeheehee...
Do keep in mind that you are interrupting my, ahem... "scholarly pursuits."

Mr. Edogawa
...Hm? What's this? You seem healthy enough. My eyes cannot be deceived!
I don't need students slouching around my office. Out you go! Shoo, shoo!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I guess he'll only see me if I'm feeling tired.
Mr. Edogawa might respond differently if
I visit him the day after I explore Tartarus...

===============================================================================================

Mr. Edogawa
Happy - What brings you to the nurse's office? Eeeheehee...

Mr. Edogawa
...What? You want some potent medicine?
I can't just give you potent medication whenever you want. Haven't you heard of the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law?

Mr. Edogawa
Hm? It's an emergency? And you absolutely, without a doubt need my medicine?
Oookay, but if you're lying to me, I'll curse your kneecaps so they'll crack every waking moment.
Well... here you are.

Mr. Edogawa
This is a special medicine I brewed myself, but I don't know if I would call it potent.

Mr. Edogawa
You got what you wanted, so off you go now.

===============================================================================================

Mr. Edogawa
Happy - What brings you to the nurse's office? Eeeheehee...
Happy - Now, what do we have here? You seem rather tired. Is it a wound? A virus? A curse? Or maybe love?
Happy - This is the perfect opportunity to test my new concoction... Eeeheeheeheehee!

Mr. Edogawa
Happy - Here, try this...
Happy - It has bitter mugwort, poison carrot, henbane, jujube, rabbit's foot, etcetera, etcetera...
Happy - Even Hakusan's finest alchemist would be astonished by these ingredients.
Happy - I shall improve your condition right here and now.
Now, drink this... Come on... Bottoms up!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The medicine Mr. Edogawa gave
me smells incredibly bizarre...
...Should I drink it?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Drink it
Don't drink it

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I downed the strange medicine, but
nothing seems to have changed...

Mr. Edogawa
Happy - Phew... Well done.
Happy - Whether or not it works is inconsequential... You survived!
Happy - You've already emptied your cup, but... cheers to your bravery!

Mr. Edogawa
Hm, if you'll excuse me, Saturn is calling...

Mr. Edogawa
...What do you mean you won't drink it!? Coward! Even Algernon drank it.
That normally quiet mouse went out of here positively squeaking with energy!

Mr. Edogawa
Oh, Algernon is my familiar— Er, I mean, my pet.
Happy - Well, it's best not to take too much medication when possible.

Mr. Edogawa
You should head home and get some rest. Off you go now.

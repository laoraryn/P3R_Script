Junpei Iori   
Yo... I'm so sleepy today.   
Happy - In times like these, the best course of action is to sleep during class!   
Happy - That adrenaline rush you get from dozing off right in front of the teacher can really spice up your dreams.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I know what you mean.   
Don't sleep in class.   
   
Junpei Iori   
It's real addicting, ain't it? After you build up the  to do it once, you gotta try it again!   
...Then again, since I'm not listening to the lecture, I'm pretty much screwed later!   
Oh, but we have classic literature today... That means we're stuck with Mr. Nasty ol' Ekoda.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Whoa, you take studying pretty seriously, huh. But it takes real  to sleep in class, you know?

Friendly Student   
Hey, you're in 2-F, right?   
...What's with that wary look in your eye? I'm Kenji Tomochika. We're in the same class.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What do you want?   
Morning.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Haha, nothing really. Just thought I'd say hi.   
I heard from Iori that you're pretty close with Takeba-san.   
...Is that true?   
Well, I guess it doesn't matter. I'm looking for someone with a little more experience anyway.   
Oh crap... It's almost time for the morning assembly. C'mon, we better hurry.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Yeah, you too.   
I heard from Iori that you're pretty close with Takeba-san.

===============================================================================================   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Yo, Arisato. You by yourself today?   
Dude, was the rumor about you and Takeba-san coming to school together even true?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Only on the first day.   
Well, no, as you can see.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
...Oh yeah? Well, it's not like I care or anything.   
Happy - Anyways, you must be pretty unlucky to have to transfer here.   
Happy - Wait... You seriously don't know? Weird stuff's been happening at this school.   
Happy - There are a couple of folks who say they've heard strange voices...   
Happy - But I guess since you're always wearing those headphones, you probably haven't heard anything.

Mitsuru Kirijo   
Good morning. Have you gotten acclimated to our school yet?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure have.   
Not really.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I see. Your ability to adapt to a new environment is impressive.   
By the way, if you ever need me for anything...   
Most times you can find me in the lounge. However, I won't be present if there's business I must attend to.   
If **I'm not at the dorm** at night, then you'll have to **put off any exploration** for another day.   
I hope you understand.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Well, that's understandable. So much seems to be happening these days.

Yukari Takeba   
Mornin'. It's been pretty warm lately, hasn't it?   
Well, it is already May... Isn't it crazy how fast time flies?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, definitely.   
Not really...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Seriously! And a lot's happened.   
Sad - And I'm sure there's a lot more to come, too... Apathy Syndrome might not go away any time soon either.   
Sad - Since we're the only ones who can fight Shadows, maybe we should be working harder...   
Besides...   
I need to get stronger, too. I can't have someone else protecting me all the time.   
   
Yukari Takeba

Akihiko Sanada   
Yo, Arisato.   
How's it going? Do you feel like you're getting stronger after every battle?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, a lot.   
Not at all.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Great, keep it up.   
Keep on training. With real battle experience, you'll be ready for whatever comes our way.   
I'll be fully recovered in no time, so you can count on me to help out on the front lines.   
But don't let your guard down just 'cause I got your back.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Heh, don't be so modest.

Junpei Iori   
Wassup, my dude? It's another glorious day with our good ol' buddy, sleep deprivation...   
The day before yesterday though? That was wild.   
I've never felt that kinda thrill in my entire life.   
Don't you think things have been gettin' real excitin' lately?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Kinda.   
How so?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - I know, right?   
Happy - We pretty much won the battle and saved the city from total annihilation.   
Happy - How sweet is that!?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Dude, are you crazy!? We've got these sick powers!   
Happy - Plus, we pretty much won the battle and saved the city from total annihilation.   
Happy - How sweet is that!?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Mornin'. You hear the news...?   
There've been fewer new cases of Apathy Syndrome the last few days.   
Senpai said it's probably because we beat that Shadow.   
Happy - If that's the case, then we did a pretty good job!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Thanks to our hard work.   
It might be a coincidence.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It makes me glad that we went through with it.   
Happy - We can't be celebrating just yet though since we have midterms next week...   
Let's just hope nothing like that happens again until midterms are over.   
Speaking of midterms, Junpei told me something...   
Apparently, Kirijo-senpai is going to give us a reward if we do well on our exams.   
Exasperated* - But I bet her standards are so high that we won't get anything unless we make the top ten in our grade...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - You really think so? But it's still good that there are less incidents.

Mitsuru Kirijo   
Good morning. Exams begin next week. Are you prepared?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You bet.   
Not at all...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Glad to hear that. I'll expect good results.   
Happy - **If you get good exam scores, I'll give you a little something**... Consider it a reward.   
To be honest, I'm not as well prepared as I should be. I'm still preoccupied with monitoring Shadows.   
At any rate, the number of incidents has decreased since our last mission.   
Happy - If we can continue to defeat them, we may be able to rid the public of their fear...   
But that large Shadow we encountered recently was clearly much more powerful than the one in April.   
Even if we include Akihiko in our ranks after he fully recovers, we're still lacking manpower.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I hope you're just being modest. Regardless, make sure you're studying diligently.

Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - *huff* *huff* H-Hey.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Running late?   
Not feeling well?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
*huff* No... It's not that... *huff* I just ran all the way here.   
The doctor said I'm almost fully recovered, so... I couldn't wait to get some exercise.   
It's 'bout time for me to get back in the ring... After midterms next week, I'll be ready for club activities and fighting Shadows.   
That's why I'm trying to make up for lost time. The last thing I want to be is a burden.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
*huff* The opposite, actually... *huff* I ran all the way here.

Akihiko Sanada   
Yo, Arisato. The midterm exams end today, huh.   
If the doctor gives me the OK today, I'll be able to fight with you guys again... Finally.   
By the way, I have a favor to ask.   
You've been doing a good job **choosing what day to explore Tartarus and leading the team**...   
You don't seem to have any trouble doing either, so I want you to keep it up.   
That way, I can just focus on getting stronger. What do you say?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I don't mind.   
I'm not confident...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Great. I already talked to Mitsuru, and she was fine with it. Good luck.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You've got this. I'll be there to support you, too, of course.   
I already talked to Mitsuru, and she was fine with it. Good luck.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Mornin'. You're as punctual as always, Arisato-kun.   
This morning, Junpei left earlier than usual, looking like the world was about to end.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's a rare sight.   
What happened?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, no kidding. This is the same Junpei who's always running late.   
Our midterm scores are going to be revealed today, so...   
He said he's gonna beg the teachers for a higher score before they get posted.   
Sad - ...As if that's gonna work.   
Oh, by the way, you remember that girl Sanada-senpai was talking about? Yamagishi-san?   
I heard she has a weak constitution... But that's just a rumor. I wonder what she's really like.   
Happy - But having more people join us in our fight is good news, right?

Sad - 'Sup, dude...?   
Sad - Hey, how'd you do on your exams...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'm satisfied with them.   
Not so great.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - What!? You traitor!   
Looking away - Dude, I'm a laughing stock... You know what I heard these two cute first-year girls saying?   
Looking away - "Did you see the exam results? Specifically Iori-senpai's?"   
"He sure talks big, unlike his brain!"   
Looking away - Do you understand what I'm going through!?   
Looking away - My heart is in shambles... And we're not even getting a new girl on the team.   
...No, wait. It's too early to give up hope. We still haven't heard back from her yet!   
How can we get her to join us? I should figure out what to say to convince her.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Really? You say that, but I bet your scores are still higher than mine...

Minato Arisato - Selection   
Of what?   
Calm down.   
   
Junpei Iori   
About that girl, Fuuka Yamagishi. I haven't lost hope that she'll join our team.   
Happy - Dude, I've actually seen her around.   
Happy - And, yeah, she does look kinda frail, but that just makes me wanna be strong enough for the two of us.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - How can I be calm when another girl might be moving into our dorm!?

Mitsuru Kirijo   
Good morning.   
The student body seems to be rather restless lately, don't you agree?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Is that so?   
Yeah...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - You don't sense it...? Well, I only hope it doesn't have anything to do with Shadows.   
Akihiko said we may be receiving a new member, but we still don't know when we'll be attacked.   
So remain alert at all times.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - I thought so. Well, I only hope it doesn't have anything to do with Shadows.

...Good luck.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - The ghost story, duh! Did you already forget what we talked about last night?   
Well, whatever.   
I'm gonna look into everything there is about it. Remember, we'll **share our findings** on Friday!   
Could you also try gathering information, too, Arisato-kun? Like, maybe you could talk to some students after school.

Minato Arisato - Selection   
Of course.   
A little...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Really? Shouldn't we just let Yuka-tan handle it?   
Sad - I think she's taking this way too seriously, dude. Guess she can be pretty stubborn.   
I've got better things to do...   
Besides, I have plenty of scary stories up my sleeve.   
I bet the story I told the other night made your hair stand on end. They say it's true though.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I know you're lying, man.   
Well, not like I've done anything myself... I say we just let Yuka-tan handle it.

As for me, I have plenty of scary stories up my sleeve already.

Sad - This sucks...   
Sad - I spent so much time thinking about ghost stories that now I'm having nightmares...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
How's the research going?   
Don't push yourself.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Mm... It's going.   
But there are so many stupid rumors going around that it's tough trying to make sense of this whole thing.   
I did get some useful info though, so I plan on digging even deeper today!   
Happy - Try to remember what you find out at school, okay, Arisato-kun?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Don't worry. I'm fine.

We're gonna share our findings about the ghost stories tonight!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Looking forward to it.   
What a pain...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yep, I heard some pretty interesting stories while asking around...   
Anyway, don't forget about tonight, okay?

Mitsuru Kirijo   
Good morning.   
Yamagishi and Moriyama are recovering nicely. They'll be released from the hospital in the next few days.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's good to hear.   
What will happen now?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yes, it is.   
We'll need to invite Yamagishi to the dorm and explain what happened.   
Considering that power of hers... we could definitely use her help.

===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, I was thinking...   
Do you think Kirijo-senpai saved Yamagishi-san because it was the right thing to do?   
Or was it just because she's a Persona-user and we need her...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
She has good intentions.   
You're overthinking it.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Y-Yeah, you're right.   
......   
Well, I guess it's really up to Yamagishi-san whether or not she joins us.   
Sad - Sorry to bring this up out of the blue.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Y-Yeah, you're right.   
......   
Either way, I guess it's really up to Yamagishi-san whether or not she joins us.

===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Good morning.   
Hey, Arisato-kun... What do you think of Yamagishi-san?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
She's cute.   
She's very helpful.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - That's not what I meant.   
Sad - It's just...   
Sad - Doesn't it feel like she wasn't really given a choice in joining the team?   
I hope she'll be okay...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - That's all you have to say?   
Sad - I mean, yeah, her Persona ability is pretty amazing, but...   
Sad - Doesn't it seem like she wasn't really given a choice in joining the team?   
I hope she'll be okay...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Good morning, Arisato.   
Yamagishi will be living in the dorm with us starting today.   
And from this point on, she'll be providing us with support in Tartarus at night.   
That means I can start joining battles again.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's reassuring.   
Don't push yourself.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yes, you can depend on me.   
Even if I'm a bit slow starting out, rest assured that I'll catch up to you all in no time.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Well, you'll see.   
Even if I'm a bit slow starting out, rest assured that I'll catch up to you all in no time.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Mornin'.   
I guess it's true that there have been fewer cases of Apathy Syndrome after our missions.   
Looking away - But then again, that changes as we get closer to the next full moon...   
Looking away - ...By the way, what do you think of Kirijo-senpai?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What do you mean?   
Nothing in particular...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - Don't you think she sort of pushed Fuuka into joining too quickly?   
Looking away - I know it's nice to have more Persona-users around, especially in battle, but...   
Looking away - Something just doesn't feel right...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Yikes, I didn't mean anything weird.   
Looking away - It's just... don't you think she sort of pushed Fuuka into joining too quickly?   
Looking away - I know it's nice to have more Persona-users around, especially in battle, but...

===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Oh, there you are. Good timing. There's something I have to tell you.   
From now on, you no longer need my permission to go to Tartarus.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Why?   
All right.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Because Yamagishi can provide support. If she's present, you won't need my help.   
But I did tell her not to let you go **if both Akihiko and I are not available**.   
I'm just worried something unexpected may happen... So please keep that in mind.   
One more thing. Could you set aside some time tonight?   
It won't take too long. All right then, I'll see you later.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yamagishi will be in charge of supporting the team from now on.

===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, Arisato-kun, I've been thinking...   
Looking away - The night before last... when we learned about the twelve Shadows and their connection to Tartarus...   
Looking away - Isn't there just too much we don't understand?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You think so?   
Yeah...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - Hmm... There's just something about it that bugs me.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - Yeah... There's something about it that bugs me.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Mornin'.   
...Hey, is it just me, or has Yuka-tan been acting weird lately?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Is that so?   
...Sort of.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - You should really pay attention a little more, dude.   
She's been thinkin' way too hard about why Tartarus exists and all that.   
I mean, who cares? Am I right?   
   
Junpei Iori   
You noticed it, too?   
She's been thinkin' way too hard about why Tartarus exists and all that.   
I mean, who cares? Am I right?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Morning...   
Looking away - In about a week, there'll be another mission...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's right.   
I forgot about that.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - I wonder what we'll face this time...   
Looking away - Do we just keep going on these missions until we defeat all eight remaining Shadows?   
Looking away - Blindly following orders to get stronger by going to Tartarus and fighting Shadow after Shadow...?   
Looking away - ......   
Looking away - I've been thinking about this for a while. I feel like Kirijo-senpai is hiding something from us...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Oh my god, why are you like this?   
Looking away - I just wonder if we're gonna keep going on these missions until we defeat all eight remaining Shadows...   
Looking away - Blindly following orders to get stronger by going to Tartarus and fighting Shadow after Shadow...?   
Looking away - ......   
Looking away - I've been thinking about this for a while. I feel like Kirijo-senpai is hiding something from us...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Good morning.   
The next full moon is almost upon us... Are you feeling prepared?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Of course.   
Not really...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Good. I'm counting on you.   
According to the cycle, it should appear on **July 7th at midnight**... That's six days from now.   
The number of incidents has also been increasing as we've gotten closer to the full moon, so stay alert.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Hey, don't fool around. This isn't a game.   
Sad - Think carefully about what we're fighting for.   
According to the cycle, our next mission will be on **July 7th at midnight**... That's six days from now.   
The number of incidents has also been increasing as we've gotten closer to the full moon, so stay alert.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Mornin'. You know, it's gonna be a full moon soon.   
Doesn't it make you nervous?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, it does.   
No, it doesn't.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - R-Right? I'm glad I'm not the only one...   
But still, I guess we have to do this no matter what...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh yeah? You're always so calm, Arisato-kun...   
Well, I guess we have to do this no matter what...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Wassup?   
Tomorrow's the big day.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's right.   
For what?   
   
Junpei Iori   
I've got butterflies in my stomach... You know, like right before a big match?   
Now I know how Sanada-san feels before he gets in the ring...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Helloooooo!? It's a full moon!   
Surprised - You're as cool as a cucumber, aren'tcha? Meanwhile, I think I'm gonna hurl...   
I've got butterflies in my stomach... You know, like right before a big match?   
Now I know how Sanada-san feels before he gets in the ring...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Good morning, Arisato-kun. How are you feeling today?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Perfect.   
...Not so great.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - That's really reassuring! I guess that's why you're the leader.   
By the way, we're going to have a quick meeting about the operation tonight.   
So please return to the dorm immediately after school.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - O-Oh no, that doesn't sound good...   
Surprised - You should head back to the dorm right after school to get some rest.   
That way you'll be alert for the meeting about the operation tonight.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey...   
......   
Uh, so... exams are coming up pretty soon. Have you been studyin'?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yep.   
Nope.   
   
Junpei Iori   
...Oh yeah?   
Well, not that it's any of my business...   
   
Junpei Iori   
...Oh yeah?   
Well, not that it's any of my business...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Y-Yo, what's up?   
......   
Thank god today's the last day of exams.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah.   
How've you been?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Man, I can't wait to let off some steam...   
You gotta let loose during summer, y'know?   
   
Junpei Iori   
D-Don't ask.   
Man, I can't wait to let off some steam...   
You gotta let loose during summer, y'know?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
'Sup? It's so friggin' hot today, too...   
So... I've been thinking.   
After we defeat all the Shadows and the Dark Hour disappears, what's gonna happen then?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I don't know.   
Things will be peaceful.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, regular people don't even know about the Dark Hour to begin with, right?   
That means no one will ever know about anything we've done...   
I mean, I get it'd be a huge problem if they did, but it just kinda sucks, y'know?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, yeah, but...   
Well, regular people don't even know about the Dark Hour to begin with, right?   
That means no one will ever know about anything we've done...   
I mean, I get it'd be a huge problem if they did, but it just kinda sucks, y'know?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Dude, summer break starts tomorrow! It's prime time for a little beachside romance!   
You know, I bet other guys would kill to be in our shoes.   
After all, we're staying in the same dorm as three super cute girls. You think so, too, right?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, totally.   
Who cares?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - But if you wanna be more than friends... you've got a lot of work ahead of you.   
Exasperated* - Kirijo-senpai is top of the class and student council president. You'd have to be an uber nerd for her to even give you the time of day.   
Exasperated* - Yuka-tan's pretty popular, too. You gotta be as stylin' as she is to be a good match.   
Exasperated* - Fuuka is... well, soft-spoken and kinda hard to grasp? So you might need to take the initiative with her, I guess.   
Surprised - ...Anyways, keep this hush-hush between us, alright?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Aw, c'mon, man. You can be honest with me.   
Well, if you wanna be more than friends... you've got a lot of work ahead of you.

===============================================================================================   
   
Aigis   
I see. This must be Tartarus during the daytime.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's right.   
It's "school" right now.   
   
Aigis   
Currently, I detect no Shadows in the vicinity. However, we must remain cautious at all times.   
   
Aigis   
I see. I shall record that in my memory bank.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Good morning.   
Looking away - A news report stated that the number of cases increases just before a full moon...   
Looking away - It looks like there are more cases than last month. This is the highest it's ever been.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I see.   
Why's that?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looking away - Something must be done...   
I don't know the reason for the increase. We'll just have to remain alert at all times.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looking away - I... I'm not sure yet. I only hope that we're able to put a stop to this.   
Anyway, we'll just have to remain alert at all times.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - 'Sup, dude! There's a full moon tomorrow!   
...Hey, did you hear?   
The number of cases around town have gone up like crazy these days.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I've heard.   
So?   
   
Junpei Iori   
There are only four of those large Shadows left... Maybe they're gettin' desperate?   
...Or maybe the next one's just insanely strong!   
Happy - Oh, whoops, my bad. Haha, I shouldn't jinx it.   
Happy - Anyways, we can handle it this time, too!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - "SO"!? Dude... Nothing rocks your boat, huh.   
There are only four of those large Shadows left... Maybe they're gettin' desperate?   
...Or maybe the next one's just insanely strong!   
Happy - Oh, whoops, my bad. Haha, I shouldn't jinx it.   
Happy - Anyways, we can handle it this time, too!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The second semester just started, and there's already another full moon...   
I wonder what kind of Shadow will appear this time...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'm worried.   
You can count on me.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Me too... It'd be nice if we had more info on our enemy beforehand, but my powers aren't strong enough for that.   
I just have to do my best supporting everyone so that they can fight with confidence.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Mhm, I will! We all rely on you, actually.   
I can only provide support behind the scenes... But I'll do my best so all of you can fight with confidence!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Mornin'.   
It doesn't seem like that Chidori girl is gonna talk, does it?   
Despite everything she did, Junpei is really worried about her...   
I just don't get why...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's Junpei for you.   
I don't know either.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I guess... But I'm still a little worried.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Maybe there's more to it than we know... Still, I'm a little worried.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yo, Minato. Sorry I haven't been around lately.   
Sad - But I can't just leave her alone...   
Sad - Don't ask me why.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You've got this.   
Don't stress yourself out.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeah... Thanks, man.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Alright... Thanks, man.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Morning, Arisato-kun.   
So... there's something bothering me lately.   
Why did Aragaki-senpai suddenly decide to come back?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'm not sure.   
He's an indomitable force.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hm... Well, he looks scary, but...   
He doesn't seem like the type who'd rejoin just 'cause he likes to fight.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah. I mean, he looks scary, but...   
He doesn't seem like the type who'd rejoin just 'cause he likes to fight.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yo, Arisato.   
Just three Shadows left, huh? And only three more weeks till the next one appears.   
Personally, I'd rather take on all three at once to save us the trouble.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
There's an idea.   
Don't underestimate them.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - But I guess it wouldn't be very interesting if we managed to get rid of them so easily.   
Since we've got more manpower, it should be easier to defeat them.   
I can't wait for the next full moon.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Haha, you're right. Every enemy we've faced has been stronger than the last.   
But since we've got more manpower, it should be easier to defeat them.   
I can't wait for the next full moon.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Good morning, Arisato-kun.   
It's been feeling a lot more like fall ever since the typhoon passed...   
I really hope the fighting ends before winter comes.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'm sure it will.   
I don't know if it will.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I hope you're right.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Me neither... But I'd like to believe it will.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - 'Suuup, dude! How ya doing?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Pretty good.   
Not great.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Haha, nice! Same here, I'm doing fantastic!   
Happy - Let's OWN that next Shadow and make the world a better place, yeah?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Whoa, get it together, dude. You're our leader! But no need to worry about me, I'm in top form!   
Happy - Let's OWN that next Shadow and make the world a better place, yeah?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Aigis   
The Lost seem to be growing in number.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I didn't know.   
Why's that?   
   
Aigis   
I cannot explain why, but our highest priority should be eliminating the remaining Shadows.   
The moon will be full tomorrow.   
I shall accompany you in battle.   
   
Aigis

===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Good morning.   
Have you noticed, Arisato?   
Normally, after a successful operation, the number of Apathy Syndrome cases decreases... However, this time it's the opposite.   
There's only one Shadow left. It must be apprehensive.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, agreed.   
I'm not sure about that.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If that's indeed the case, then we'll put it to rest with the next battle.   
Happy - In any event, if it weren't for you, we wouldn't be here... So thank you.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
There are many things we don't know...   
Happy - But I know that, if it weren't for you, we wouldn't be here... So thank you.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Good morning.   
It's already mid-October, and we're about two weeks away from the final battle...   
So much has happened, and it all went by so fast. But it made me realize...   
Happy - I'm so glad everyone welcomed me to the team... Thank you, Arisato-kun.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Say that after the battle.   
I'm glad I met you, Fuuka.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Hehe, okay. I'll do my best up till the very end.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh! Um, I didn't think you'd say something like that... But that means a lot to me.   
Happy - Thank you. Let's do our best in the final battle.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
There's gonna be another full moon soon... Then we'll finally be done.   
Let's give it everything we've got.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Of course.   
I'll try...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - After this is all over, let's celebrate.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - C'mon! Show some spirit! Let's celebrate when this is all over, okay?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Good morning.   
Well, tomorrow's the day...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'm ready.   
...What's tomorrow?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I shouldn't be surprised you're as calm as always, Leader.   
I'm positive that the last Shadow will appear tomorrow, but Strega might be up to something as well...   
Anyway, please be prepared!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Um... Did you forget?   
I'm positive that the last Shadow will appear tomorrow, but Strega might be up to something as well...   
Anyway, please be prepared!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Mornin', Minato!   
Happy - Hope your stomach's up to celebrating tonight. 'Cause we're gonna stuff our faces with sushi!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'm so ready.   
Only sushi?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Me too! I haven't eaten anything since yesterday!   
Happy - You better come back right after school, man! I'll be waiting.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Y-You've got a point! This is Kirijo-senpai we're talkin' about... Maybe we'll get crab and blowfish!?   
Happy - Man, I can't wait! You better come back right after school!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...Morning.   
I heard Kirijo-senpai is coming back today.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
How is she?   
I'm glad to hear that.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - I don't know...   
Looking away - What should I even say to her...? I wouldn't be surprised if she's not up for talking, though.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - I guess...   
Looking away - What should I even say to her...? I wouldn't be surprised if she's not up for talking, though.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Aigis   
Good morning.   
...I intend to do my best to protect everyone.   
Even if that means I...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What's up?   
We're counting on you.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - ...It's nothing, please don't worry about it. I just wanted to share my feelings with you.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - ...Understood.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Morning...   
Sad - Things have been pretty crazy lately, huh... No one's in the mood to talk, either.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Keep your chin up.   
It's understandable.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Yeah...   
I guess that's all we can do. We still have to do our best at school, too.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - Yeah...   
Looking away - I just can't stop thinking about it... even when we still have to do our best at school.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Good morning, Arisato-kun...   
Sad - Um... Have you reached a decision about... you know.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'm not sure yet.   
I've made up my mind.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Honestly... I'm scared.   
Sad - I wonder what everyone else is thinking. Amada-kun looked troubled too...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I see... You really are strong. To be honest, I'm really scared.   
Sad - I wonder what everyone else is thinking. Amada-kun looked troubled too...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yo, Arisato.   
Even though we're about to face death, we're still going to school as if nothing's happened...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's surreal.   
Have you decided?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We'll have to make up our minds sooner or later.   
Even as we speak, the deadline is drawing closer... I just hope we can find the right answer.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I haven't.   
But I'm not trying to avoid it either. I want to believe that I'll reach an answer.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Good morning. How does everyone seem regarding... that discussion?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
They're thinking hard.   
No idea.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I see... Well, I feel the same as the others.   
But we can't continue on like this forever... We should talk with everyone tonight.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looks like neither of us came up with an answer either.   
But we can't continue on like this forever... We should talk with everyone tonight.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Morning. Whew, it's already so hot at this hour.   
By the way, have you heard anything about the dates for the health checkup?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I think I did.   
I haven't.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Mhm... You don't sound very sure.   
Yours is on August 14th, Arisato-kun. Don't forget, okay?   
...Anyway, it's seriously way too hot out here.   
Let's hurry and get inside. I need to be in a classroom with air-conditioning, stat.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - What, really? I told Junpei to let you know.   
Yours is on August 14th, Arisato-kun.   
...Anyway, it's seriously way too hot out here.   
Let's hurry and get inside. I need to be in a classroom with air-conditioning, stat.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Oh, there you are. You had a long night, huh.   
On that note, let's not go to Tartarus tonight.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Got it.   
Why?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Thanks.   
I'd like to look into Strega with the chairman's help.   
If I find out anything, I'll let you know.   
Also, I understand your circumstances last night, but try to avoid staying out late from now on.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I want to look into some matters with the chairman's help.   
Specifically about that group, Strega.   
If I find out anything, I'll let you know.   
Also, I understand your circumstances last night, but try to avoid staying out late from now on.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Mornin', and um... thanks for deciding to join the team yesterday.   
Since Sanada-senpai's injured, I was worried it was just going to be Kirijo-senpai and me...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You can rely on me.   
Injured?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Yeah! Let's do our best together!   
I wonder when he'll recover from his injury...   
He said it wasn't a big deal, but still...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Yeah, Sanada-senpai was attacked by a Shadow the same night you collapsed, too.   
He said it was just a minor injury to his ribs, but still...

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Good morning, Arisato-kun.   
......   
Um... It's a beautiful day, is it not? How are you faring today?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Not bad.   
Why so formal?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Th-That is wonderful news...   
Surprised - S-Sorry for being so awkward!   
Surprised - I've never had the chance to chat with someone on the way to school, so I got nervous...   
But I think I'm getting used to life in the dorm.   
Plus, I'm pretty excited about everything we can do there.   
Happy - I'd love to try caring for some plants up on the roof—anything, really—when I have the time.

Junpei Iori   
'Sup?   
We're supposed to gather in front of the faculty office during lunch.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Okay.   
What's this about?   
   
Junpei Iori   
To be honest, I don't feel like doing it, but we don't have a choice.   
And asking Mr. Ekoda for an explanation sounds like a total pain in the ass.   
This is so lame, especially after going to that spot behind the station at night.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Uh, dude, you serious? We're supposed to ask about Fuuka Yamagishi, remember?

===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Yo! You ready to kick some ass?   
Happy - I'm so glad I was invited to join. Plus, the dorm's pretty cozy.   
Happy - But the best part is that we're the only ones who can fight these Shad— Er, enemies!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You seem pretty gung-ho.   
I don't really care.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Well, DUH!   
Happy - Who wouldn't be stoked about fighting for justice!?   
Though to be perfectly honest... I ain't got a single clue what we're supposed to be doing.   
But I'm sure we'll find out. They did say that they'll explain everything.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - C'mon, you can't be serious. We're basically superheroes fighting for justice!   
Sad - You're part of the team, too, so you should get your head in the game.

===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yo, long time no see. What's up? Did you have an upset stomach or something?   
Happy - Anyways, I got something to tell ya!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What happened?   
Aren't you full of energy.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Actually...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Oh, wait! I'm not supposed to spill!   
Happy - Sorry, man. Forget you heard anything. Hahahaha.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sheesh, someone's full of energy today... I could hear you from all the way over there.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh? You two didn't come to school together even though you're in the same dorm?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Ugh, I've heard enough about that.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Anyway... Arisato-kun. Are you feeling better?   
Sad - Sorry to hit you with this so soon after you've recovered...   
But the chairman wants to talk to you today.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Head to the dorm after school and come up to the fourth floor. Don't forget, okay?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Hey, you totally thought I was a pain in the ass just now, didn't you?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Er, my bad. I'm not the same person as I was yesterday. Just forget all about the ol' Junpei...   
Sad - Anyways, sorry for always making everything about me.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - You should cheer up, too. After all, you got a friend in me!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sheesh, someone's full of energy today... I could hear you from all the way over there.

Surprised - Hold up... Why are you being called out by the chairman? What the heck did you do!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It's nothing serious. C'mon, we're gonna be late if we just stand around here talking.

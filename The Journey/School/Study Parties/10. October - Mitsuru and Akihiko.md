Akihiko Sanada   
...Oh, Arisato. You here for a change of pace?   
Mitsuru and I are trying to study, but we're not really getting anywhere...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ......   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hey, you should join us. We might make some progress, all three of us together, don't you think?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure.   
I'll pass.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Good, then it's settled. Go get your things and meet us back here.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I see, no worries. Let me know if you change your mind.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Oh, you're back? Did you decide to join us?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
What do you say?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's study together.   
Nah.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Good, then it's settled. Go get your things and meet us back here.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All right, then. Well, we'll be here if you decide otherwise.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Right now, the Temperance Arcana   
may help me grow even more...

Mitsuru Kirijo   
Akihiko, regarding mathematical proofs... How would you approach this one?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Trigonometry, huh? This is a fun one. I'd say using the law of cosines here would be the quickest.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - First, you need to set up an equation. Then, since a and c are prime numbers, you can rearrange it like this, and... done.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - C'est magnifique! A brilliant method.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Exasperated* - I thought these kinds of problems were easy for you. Were you just testing me?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - I didn't mean anything by it. True, I did have in mind a number of ways to solve this...   
But I found myself wondering about your thought process. I have to say, your speed and accuracy were impressive.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Then I'll test you on the next one. Let's race and see who can solve it quicker!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The two of them are taking   
their studies seriously...   
I should try to focus as well...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Oh, it's been quite some time already... We should remember to take breaks.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You've got a point... Focusing for too long has diminishing returns. Let's rest for a bit.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Well then, why don't we resume in twenty minutes? You can spend your time however you'd like until then.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Oh, come to think of it, I haven't gotten any running in today... Guess I'll head out for a refresher.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - You're leaving the building? You do understand we only have twenty minutes, correct?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Even a short workout's a nice change of pace. What were you guys planning on doing?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I was thinking of making some tea... What about you, Arisato?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'll do a short workout.   
I'll read a book.   
I'll doodle in my notebook.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - You hear that, Mitsuru? Looks like Arisato and I are on the same page.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Exasperated* - I'm well aware that exercise is good for the brain. What I'm worried about is your lack of restraint.   
Exasperated* - Every time you run, you push yourself to the limit. I would hardly call that a "refresher."   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - Yeah, I know I tend to go a little overboard... sometimes, I guess.   
Sad - ...Fine, I won't go for a run. Guess I'll just do a few stretches.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Ooh, a fine choice. I often read books on my breaks myself.   
Let's see, why don't I ready enough tea for all three of us? Akihiko, it wouldn't hurt to try reading for a change.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - Fine... Guess I'll join you guys this time.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Haha... Doodling, huh? I used to do that a lot back in the day.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - You, doodling? That's quite a surprise. I don't think I've seen you do anything of the sort.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Miki used to ask me to draw things. I practiced like a madman trying to learn how to draw anime characters...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Oh? That's an interesting development. Why don't you show us for old times' sake?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Exasperated* - Spare me, please. If anything, I'd rather see what Arisato is drawing.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
After the break, we got back to studying...   
The subtle tension in the air   
helped me stay on track...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I appreciate you inviting us today. You wanted to help take our minds off of recent events, didn't you?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Haha... Did you think we didn't notice?   
Happy - You know, it's usually the senpai's role to do these kinds of things... But we decided to take you up on it.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Thanks to this, Akihiko and I were able to get back on our feet. You can expect we'll return the favor in kind.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Yeah. We'll help push you as far as your brain can go. Your exams won't know what hit 'em!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
For now, let's call it a day. Make sure to get your rest, both of you.

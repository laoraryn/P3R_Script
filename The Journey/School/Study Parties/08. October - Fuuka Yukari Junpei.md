Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Oh, Arisato-kun, good timing! Fuuka just suggested that we study for the exams together.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - C'mon, there's no point studying at a time like this. You're with me, right, dude?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - "At a time like this," huh? Like you'd want to study if things were normal...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um, I just thought studying with everyone might help take our minds off things...   
Happy - So, if it's not too much trouble... What do you think, Arisato-kun?

Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's study together.   
What's everyone's status?   
I want to go to Tartarus.   
I'll pass.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh, I'm so happy to hear that. Thank you!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Better get your stuff, then. And Junpei, stop doodling on your notes!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Okay. I understand if you're not in the mood for it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - If you feel like studying, just let us know. We'll be here.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, Arisato-kun. Did you change your mind?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Are you up for studying with us?

Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's study together.   
I want to go to Tartarus.   
No thanks.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - That's great! I'm so glad we can all study together again, even at a time like this...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Arisato-kun, you can sit here. Come on, Junpei, stop zoning out!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
All right. Well, whenever you're up for it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Feel free to join us anytime you feel like studying.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
These people already have plans, so they can't go tonight:

Yukari Takeba   
Hurt - ...It's looking pretty bad for me this time.   
Sad - I haven't been able to study at all. I'm gonna have to cram everything starting now...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um... Can I help you with something else?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Dude, are you serious!? I mean, I don't wanna study either, but...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hurt - Uh, sorry, but if you're really gonna go to Tartarus, I'll have to pass. I really need to study...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Not everyone will be able to go today, then... Would you still like to go anyway?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yes, let's go.   
Never mind.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
...All right. Let's gather when the time comes, then.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Seriously...? Well, I guess it's better than studying...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - You scared me there for a second...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Right now, the Temperance Arcana   
may help me grow even more...   
   
-----   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I'm glad everyone showed up for this. I probably wouldn't have been able to concentrate on my own...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Yeah... It hasn't been very long. Thanks for inviting me. I think this'll be a big help for me, too.   
   
Junpei Iori   
We've gotta keep going. It's the only thing we can do.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You're right.   
I don't think I can...   
One step ahead of you.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah... Amada-kun and Sanada-senpai have been trying to move on, too.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I know it's hard... But even Aragaki-senpai wouldn't want us to be moping around forever.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Yeah... I think so too.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Haha, I knew we could count on you.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um... I don't mean to be a busybody, but if there's anything you need help with, please let me know.   
I am the one who suggested this study session, after all...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Fuuka... You don't need to worry about a thing, okay?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sorry. It's just... I always admired things like this. You know, everyone meeting up to study together.   
I always thought it would be nice to stop by a restaurant on our way home and help each other out...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Hehe... I can make that wish come true! Let's see, what should you help me with first?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's supposed to go both ways.   
I'd like some help too.   
What about the restaurant?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - No worries! If it's health and gym class, I've got your back!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - You can do that on your own time.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Hehe, give me just a moment. So, Junpei-kun... You need help with physics first?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Um, I'm pretty sure the restaurant wasn't the point!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - ...I'm glad I came to this dorm. Even after a terrible tragedy, you guys help me remember how to smile.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I'm glad you came here too, Fuuka.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, right! Could you help me with this part?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sure. Hmm... This one's difficult. Let's see...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I know the answer.   
Let's work it out together.   
You're up, Junpei.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh, I see. So that's the formula you need to use... I'm impressed you figured it out, Arisato-kun!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
......   
I don't know how to solve this...   
If my Academics were Above Average,   
maybe I could figure it out...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It's a toughie, isn't it? But yeah, more heads are better than one, for sure.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Alright, what've we got here? Health? Gym? Wait, math!? Yeah, I'll pass.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
By helping each other out, I think I   
was able to study more effectively...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Whew... I was in the zone. I guess that really did help me take my mind off of things.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Mhm. It's nice to know that we're not alone.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
The power of friendship.   
I'd be fine on my own.   
Go, Team Second-Year!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Dude, you did not just say that. How corny can you be? I get what you mean, though...   
Happy - Hehe, guess we'll just keep givin' it our all. It's the least we can do to take some weight off our senpais.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Man, oh man... Can't our great leader read the room for once?   
Happy - Well, guess we'll just keep givin' it our all. It's the least we can do to take some weight off our senpais.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Ooh, I like the sound of that. Go, Team Second-Year! Woooooo!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - What are you doing? This is embarrass—   
   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - W-Wooo!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Hehe, guess we'll just keep givin' it our all. It's the least we can do to take some weight off our senpais.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Okay, I think it's about time we call it a night. Thanks for the help, guys. Good night.

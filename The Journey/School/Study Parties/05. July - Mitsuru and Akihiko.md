Akihiko Sanada   
Oh, Arisato.   
I came down to get a drink and got caught by Mitsuru... As you can see.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm not worried about Akihiko's grades. I'm more worried he'll run off and do some reckless training.   
Happy - And studying has the added benefit of preventing that possibility.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - So here we are. Even though I'm mostly done studying for the exams...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Then, why don't you overlook Arisato's studies? That is, if he is able to join us.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Please do.   
I'm good.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All right... Sit down. I'll be your study coach.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - If you're doing fine on your own, great. Just let me know if you want some help.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What's wrong? Did you decide you want Akihiko's help after all?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What's wrong?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Did you decide you want Akihiko's help after all?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yes, please.   
No, I'm fine.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All right... Sit down. I'll be your study coach.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well, we'll be here for a while if you change your mind.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Right now, the Temperance Arcana   
may help me grow even more...

Akihiko Sanada   
I was hoping to go for another run after rehydrating...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I believe you've done enough physical activity for one day. Any more, and you'll hurt yourself.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Fine. So, Arisato, were there any subjects you needed help with?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Any tips for grasping formulas?   
Any tips for remembering kanji?   
Any tips for memorizing vocab?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Nothing beats using them in practice problems. Are you concerned about getting bored and losing focus?   
In that case, try a quick workout between problems. The brain perks up once you get the circulation flowing.   
Not to mention, looking forward to your next workout is a great way to stay motivated.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
The most basic method is writing them over and over again... But I get that's a tough way to stay motivated.   
That's why I reward myself with workout reps based on the number of new kanji I've learned.   
The more you study, the stronger you'll get. Pretty motivating, huh?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I increase the number of reps in my workout by the number of new words I've committed to memory.   
The more you learn, the further you can push your limits. Killing two birds with one stone, as they say.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - In any case, I advise having a good workout ready to treat yourself with after a study session.   
Happy - It all comes down to making it a regular habit. Just a little each day really adds up.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - I wasn't going to say anything, but... Akihiko, working out isn't normally a "reward" for most people.   
Sad - On top of that, what good does it do to preach about long-term habits mere days before the exam?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Exasperated* - Hm, I guess you have a point... In that case, how would you recommend cramming for it?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's not my usual style, but I would focus on memorizing material that is likely to be tested.   
If you give it your all, it shouldn't be too difficult. Easier than facing the enemy wholly unprepared, at least.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well, we can talk all night, but doing is where the magic happens. Here, let me give you some practice problems.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The two of them continued   
giving me rigorous advice...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - You catch on quick, Arisato. You immediately took what you learned and put it into practice.   
Happy - All you need now is some strength training and you'll be unstoppable.   
Happy - Once the exams are over, why don't we dive into Tartarus for a bit and get some workouts in?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Exasperated* - You never change... I'll need to continue keeping an eye on you to make sure you don't overdo it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Heh. The more you study and the more you train, the better results you'll get.   
Happy - I look forward to seeing what you'll accomplish from here on, Arisato.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Let's call it here for today. I want to get some stretches in before heading to bed.

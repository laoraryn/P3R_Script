Sad - ......

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
......
The air feels kind of heavy...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hm...? Oh, it's you. Sorry, I was just thinking about something...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I invite them to study
for a change of pace...?

Akihiko Sanada
You look like you have something to say. Do you need something?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's study together.
It's nothing.

Akihiko Sanada
Oh, right, exams are coming up soon. Time marches on without a care in the world, huh?

Mitsuru Kirijo
An invitation to study from Arisato is uncommon. Let's take him up on the offer.

Akihiko Sanada
Well, if you say so.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Look at the time. I shouldn't be wasting time sitting around like this...

Akihiko Sanada
Hm? Do you need something after all?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's study together.
It's nothing.

Akihiko Sanada
Oh, right, exams are coming up soon. Time marches on without a care in the world, huh?

Mitsuru Kirijo
An invitation to study from Arisato is uncommon. Let's take him up on the offer.

Akihiko Sanada
I see... Well, if you ever need anything, just let us know.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Right now, the Temperance Arcana
may help me grow even more...

......

Akihiko Sanada
Mitsuru... That section won't be covered on the exam.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Oh... Sorry. I'm having some difficulty concentrating.

Akihiko Sanada
Exasperated* - Guess that's to be expected with everything going on... I'm not immune to it either.
Exasperated* - Sorry, Arisato. I know we're the ones who invited you to study, but... Well, just look at us.

Minato Arisato - Selection
It's not your fault.
We need to press on.
Wanna sing a song?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Heh... We're making you worry, aren't we?

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Definitely feels like we're the ones getting the most worked up about it.

Akihiko Sanada
I do understand that... But not everyone can carry themselves like you do.
Happy - But I suppose as your senpais, we should be showing you a little more dignity.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - You do have a point.

Akihiko Sanada
You're so relaxed, it's almost scary.
If you're hiding how you really feel, I'd say you're doing a good job of it. But in your case...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Yes, I doubt it's an act. This is just who he is.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Well, we can't let ourselves be outdone, now can we?
Rain or shine, this is still the last exam we'll ever take as high school students. All the more reason to give it our all.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - You're right—there's no excuse for slacking. It's time to prove what these last three years have led up to.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Ooh, I see the fire in your eyes. At this rate, I may have to relinquish my position as top student.
That said, test results are but a single measure. What truly matters is that we continue to improve ourselves.
Happy - May we both make this a triumphant finale to our time here.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Back to normal, I see.
Talk about a heated rivalry...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sorry for causing you concern. Rest assured, we're both in the right mindset now.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Heh, and who's the one who stoked the flames? I expect you'll see this study session through to make up for that.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Well, I think we've dallied enough. We'll need to make up for lost time.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can sense a strong motivation
from Mitsuru and Sanada...
I feel like I'm focusing better than usual...

Akihiko Sanada
Surprised - Whoa... Didn't realize so much time had passed. Guess I was in the zone.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I don't think I've been able to focus this well in a long while. I've just finished reviewing the material.

Minato Arisato - Selection
You two were serious, huh?
I could barely keep up...

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Serious? Heh, not even close. But I guess that means we've earned a bit of your respect back.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Heh, that so? Well, I guess that means we've earned a bit of your respect back.

Mitsuru Kirijo
We're almost through this. Keep at it, you two.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Cool, guess that's that. Now all we gotta do is ace the exams.

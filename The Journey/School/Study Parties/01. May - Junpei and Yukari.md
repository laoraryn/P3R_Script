Yukari Takeba
Oh, Arisato-kun. Can you do something about this guy?
Exasperated* - He came crying to me for help studying for the exams...

Junpei Iori
Surprised - C'mon, you gotta help me out here, Yuka-tan!
Happy - Minato, you'll help too, right? Right!?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's study together.
No thanks.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Alright! Thanks, man! So you'll help too, right, Yuka-tan?

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Geez, fine...

Yukari Takeba
Yeah, I can't blame you... Studying with Junpei would just be a waste of time.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Hey, c'mon! I'm not that bad!

Yukari Takeba
I wouldn't mind if Arisato-kun joined in, though...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Oh, Minato. You gonna help me study?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Oh, Minato.

Junpei Iori
Happy - You gonna help me study?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's study together.
No thanks.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Alright! Thanks, man! So you'll help too, right, Yuka-tan?

Yukari Takeba
Geez, fine...

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - It's because you never take it seriously, Junpei. It'd be nice if Arisato-kun joined us...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Right now, the Temperance Arcana
may help me grow even more...

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - Man, this sucks... Guess I don't have much choice with Kirijo-senpai getting on my case.
Angry - She was like, "If you fail your midterm, there will be consequences." I feared for my life for a second!
Sad - You guys are my only hope! Gimme a hand here... Pleeease?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - You can start by taking this seriously. You've been distracted this whole time.

Junpei Iori
As they say, it pays to be prepared! Gotta get myself in the right mindset first, right?
A good study session needs a clean and organized workspace and the perfect mood for learning.

Junpei Iori
Happy - And so, to set that mood, I, Junpei Iori, volunteer!

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - What? Where is this coming from?

Junpei Iori
Happy - You there, young man! What lecture would you like to hear from the great Junpei? History? Arithmetic? Literature?

Minato Arisato - Selection
History.
Arithmetic.
Literature.

Junpei Iori
So you'd like to hear about history, huh? Well then...
This one's about a certain archeological team. They spent their whole lives excavating, only to find nothing. In the end...

Yukari Takeba
Angry - If you say, "their career was in ruins," I will hit you.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Aw, come on, don't steal the punchline! And don't hit me, either...

Junpei Iori
Something on arithmetic, huh? Understood.
Long ago, they tried to teach math to a sheepdog. The farmer asked, "What's five plus four?" But then it barked ten times.
Happy - He asked for nine times two, and it barked twenty times. Guess old habits die hard for the sheepdog. It couldn't stop rounding them up!

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Ugh... I wish I could cut you out of the equation.

Junpei Iori
Aha, a man of culture. Literature it is, then...
Have you ever read the famous dystopian science fiction novel "1984"?
Happy - Oh, you haven't? That's a shame, but Orwell...!

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Ugh... I'd really like to close the book on this chapter.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Look, we all need a breather sometimes! What'd ya think about the great Junpei's lecture, Minato?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Nice change of pace.
You need to focus...
I'd like to hear another.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Right? Can't have a good study session without a good break!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Oh, please. Don't let yourself get infected by Junpei's influence.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Seriously... Okay, Junpei, no more opening your mouth. You can breathe, I guess, but that's it!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Then what's the point of studying together!?

Junpei Iori
Scheming - Ah, quite the studious young man, aren't you? Then allow me to give you my best lecture yet!

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Ugh! Stupei, you're starting to infect Arisato-kun's mind too.

Yukari Takeba
If we keep humoring you, it's going to impact our studies too.
Or maybe we should just let you fail. Find out what Kirijo-senpai's "consequences" are like firsthand.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Whoa, whoa, whoa, let's not get hasty here! I was just joking around!
Surprised - I'll get serious, I swear! Don't abandon meee!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We all got down to business and
continued studying for the test...

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - So this goes like that... and then you take that and carry it over to here... and then, uhh...

Junpei Iori
Hey, Minato... You mind givin' me a little help with this one?

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Oh, look who's actually putting the effort in! That wasn't so bad, was it?

Junpei Iori
About that joke I was telling earlier... Should I pause before the punchline, or go with the flow?

Yukari Takeba
Very happy* - ...Arisato-kun, why don't we just pretend this guy doesn't exist and study on our own?

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Whew... I guess that's enough studying for today. Thanks to you, I got a lot more done!

Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - It's almost time for exams... Have you been studying?   
We were just about to start studying together. Do you want to join us, Arisato-kun?   
Happy - It's okay with you, right, Fuuka?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Of course. Will you study with us?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's study together.   
I want to go to Tartarus.   
No thanks.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Great! Let's get started.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, okay. No problem.   
Let us know if you change your mind, okay?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hm? Did you decide to study with us?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hm?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Did you decide to study with us?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's study together.   
I want to go to Tartarus.   
No thanks.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Great! Let's get started.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
All right. Well, let us know if you change your mind.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Really...? Maybe let's not tonight...   
Exams are right around the corner, you know. We should probably be studying.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Right now, the Temperance Arcana   
may help me grow even more...

Yukari Takeba   
Fuuka, your notes look so trendy! Kinda wasn't expecting that.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh, no. These are Natsuki-chan's notes.   
Happy - She let me borrow them since I was out trapped in Tartarus.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What a good friend.   
It's kinda hard on the eyes...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Mhm! She sure is.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - It is rather colorful... I wonder how many different pens she uses.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
That said, there's actually quite a bit missing from these notes...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, you're right. This part just has the equation and no answer... And this page is full of doodles.   
And this part, uh... Is that a drool stain?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Hey, it may not be the best study material, but it's the thought that counts, right?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Mhm... I've been trying to think of a way to return the favor.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Complete her notes.   
Fill in the blanks.   
It's the thought that counts.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Complete her notes? You mean like, fill in all the parts she's missing?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh, that sounds like a great idea! But it's going to be a lot of material... I wonder if I can finish it all.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Then we'll help you out! It'll be a good review for us, too.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Huh?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh! Are you saying I should fill in any parts she missed in her notes before giving them back?   
Happy - That sounds like a great idea! But it's going to be a lot of material... I wonder if I can finish it all.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Then we'll help you out! It'll be a good review for us, too.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You guys are friends, right? I don't think you need to worry about it, but I get how you feel.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh, I know. Maybe I could fill in the parts that are missing in her notes... Or would that be rude?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I think that's a great idea!   
Happy - We could even help you out. It'd help us review the material too, right?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - ...Thanks, you two.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Here, lemme see those notes.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh... Yeah!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
We began to fill in Natsuki's notes...   
We nearly rewrote the entire thing.   
It really did make for a good review...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - All done! It looks wonderful!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Haha, Natsuki-chan's in for a real surprise when she sees this.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I hope she likes it.   
That was a lot of work...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I'm sure she will. I couldn't have done it without your help... Thanks, you two.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Well, it certainly helped us study, too. Right, Arisato-kun?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - You two put in a lot of effort to match Natsuki-chan's colorful note-taking.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - There was only so much we could do to live up to her style, but it was pretty fun to try it out.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I'll make sure to give Natsuki-chan the notes back tomorrow. Good night.

Shuji Ikutsuki   
About Yakushima... Remember that you won't be able to go if you don't score well on your exams.   
Since everyone is here, why don't you have the third-years overlook your studies?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
If that sounds good, I can ask Kirijo-kun and Sanada-kun for their help. What do you say?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yes, please.   
No thanks.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
All right. I'll let the other second-years know too.   
Happy - Hm... With a ferry trip to Yakushima on the line... I hope you perform ferry well on your exams!   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Oh, is that so? Well, there's no rush to make a decision right this moment.   
Let me know if you change your mind. I'll let everyone else know just in case.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Hello, again. Do you feel up for that study session now?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yes, I'd like to.   
No thanks.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Now that's what I like to hear!   
Happy - Hm... With a ferry trip to Yakushima on the line... I hope you perform ferry well on your exams!   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Well, it's not mandatory, so you can join in when you feel like it.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Right now, the Temperance Arcana   
may help me grow even more...

Akihiko Sanada   
I'm fine helping out with studying, but... wouldn't it be easier to focus without the distraction?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
They say studying with others grants benefits that can't be found alone.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Hey, so, if we flunk the exams... are we really gonna have to stay behind!? Tell me that's a joke!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's no joke. As students, studying is our top priority. Failure will result in consequences.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Well, I'm not too worried about that. Not naming names here, but don't get in the way, Junpei.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - What happened to not naming names!?   
Exasperated* - Ugh... I guess if the fate of my trip depends on it, I don't really have a choice.   
Angry - I'll show you. I'll prove just how serious I am about Yakushima!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
My hand stops as I hit a tough question...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
What's the matter, Arisato? Something you need help with?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
This vocabulary...   
This math problem...   
This grammar...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Ah, "scintillating"... It can refer to either a literal sparkle, or a metaphorical brilliance.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - Learn your vocab, or instead of going to Yakushima, you're going to Yaku-see-me back at the dorm!   
Happy - Yakushima, Yaku-see-me... Hmm, maybe that one's a little forced...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
An arithmetic sequence, huh? Do you remember the formula for calculating its sum? See, if you do this...   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - A beautiful formula really arithmetickles my fancy! Haha, yeah, that one's pretty good. Let me write that down...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Old English verb conjugation differs from modern day. For example, "you are" becomes "thou art"...   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - Oh my! Remembering how to use archaic forms of verbs sounds rather in-tense!   
Happy - Hmm... In-tense! I like the sound of that one. Keeping a note of that...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Wisecracks from Junpei are one thing, but I didn't account for this...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Maybe he's trying to... test our ability to concentrate? Yeah, I suppose that's not likely.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Scheming - Hmm, Ikutsuki-san's one-upping me. I've gotta think of a killer comeback...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - Stop getting distracted. You need to concentrate on your studies!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
She's right. Gotta focus... Let's keep at it, Arisato-kun.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I focused so hard, I couldn't   
hear anything else...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Are you struggling with memorization, Arisato? Nothing beats repeating it until you know it by heart.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - Beats... Heart? Bwahaha! Not bad, Kirijo-kun!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Wha—!? No, that— That was not my intent with that statement...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Well, if you're pullin' out of the race, then I win hands down! Kirijo-senpai de-feet-ed!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Ugh... This is giving me a headache.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Despite the diversions, I'd say that was productive. Keep it up so we can all go to Yakushima together.

Yukari Takeba
Oh, hey, Arisato-kun. You remember finals start tomorrow, right?
Sad - So... I was just talking to Fuuka...
Sad - And we want to try studying together with everyone... like normal...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - I was going to talk to Kirijo-senpai about it, but it seems like she went out for a bit...
I wonder if we'll get into trouble for organizing it without permission...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Well, we can just apologize if that happens. But... do you think anyone else wants to study anyway?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - You're right. Some of them might want to be left alone... But I...

Yukari Takeba
...What do you think? Do you want to study and try to get back into the normal swing of things?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I want to study together.
I want to go to Tartarus.
I'll pass.

Yukari Takeba
Really...? Yeah, me too.
Happy - I'm gonna give it a shot and invite everyone. You should get your materials ready in the meantime!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Oh, I'll go with you, Yukari-chan!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Oh, okay... You're not in the mood for it, huh...?
But let me know if you suddenly feel up for it, okay? We'll be here.

Yukari Takeba
Hey. Think you're up for a study session now?

Yukari Takeba
Wanna try? If you're not too busy.

Minato Arisato - Selection
I want to study together.
I want to go to Tartarus.
I'll pass.

Yukari Takeba
Really...? Yeah, me too.
Happy - I'm gonna give it a shot and invite everyone. You should get your materials ready in the meantime!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Oh, I'll go with you, Yukari-chan!

Yukari Takeba
Okay... We'll be here if you change your mind, okay?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Huh? Tartarus? Um...
We have exams tomorrow, so we should probably focus on that...

Fuuka Yamagishi - MND_Temperance
Right now, the Temperance Arcana
may help me grow even more...

Junpei Iori
Sad - Hey, so uh, didn't Kirijo-senpai say we shouldn't be hanging out like this?
Sad - Think she'll be mad if she finds out?

Akihiko Sanada
I kind of doubt it...
But I won't deny that seeing you all does remind me of recent events.

Junpei Iori
Happy - R-Right! Well then, why don't we just call it a wrap here...?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Um, Sanada-senpai! I'd like to ask for some help with this question!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Oh, uh... Wait, Junpei-kun! I wanted to ask you, uh... Um...

Ken Amada
I think I'll take Koromaru for a walk.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Hey, wait! We'll all take him on a walk when we're done. You can sit back down, Amada-kun!

Mitsuru Kirijo
......

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Oh, ahaha... I guess you found out. I was planning on inviting you too, Mitsuru-senpai...
Looking away - I do understand that we don't have time for chitchat, but...
Looking away - I just... wanted to spend time with everyone.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - Um, this was actually my idea! I was the one who wanted to gather everyone...
Sad - So... I'm sorry. I don't want everyone to get in trouble for my selfishness...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Exasperated* - ......

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Hey, you shouldn't be the only one that has to apologize. I feel the same way, Fuuka.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Thanks, Yukari-chan. It's just... when I think this might be the last—


Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - Um...! In any case, I apologize for this! Let's just call it for today!

Minato Arisato - Selection
We're not calling it.
Let's keep studying.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Arisato-kun...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - ...Thank you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
After warning you all, I wasn't sure how to go back on it. I was actually taking a walk to mull it over.
Happy - Yukari... Yamagishi... I feel the same way you do.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Eh, you did say we should try to go about our lives for now. You hear that, Junpei? Let's get to it.

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - If we're talkin' MY life, studying's the last thing I'd be doing...

Yukari Takeba
Very happy* - Mitsuru-senpai, could you help me with this?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Heh, of course. What question did you need help with?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We studied together as we always do...
I feel I was able to focus
better than usual...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Whew, how long have we been studying? Time really flies when we're all in it together.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I agree... Thank you for going along with my suggestion, everyone.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Time well spent.
You owe us.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - You think so? I hope everyone else feels the same way.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Hehe... Sure! If anyone has any requests, please let me know. That includes you, Arisato-kun.

Ken Amada
Sad - By the way... I hope you haven't forgotten about taking Koromaru for a walk.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Er— Of course not! C'mon, everyone, let's go!

Koromaru
Happy - Arf!

Mitsuru Kirijo
That'll be it for studying, then. Everyone, make sure to give it your all on the exams.

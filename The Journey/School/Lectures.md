Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I'm feeling sleepy...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I close my eyes for a few minutes?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Stay awake   
Close your eyes   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I forced myself to stay awake   
and listen to the lecture...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I can feel the teacher's glare   
as I start nodding off...   
It's like my  is being tested...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
   
   
Mr. Ekoda   
Ahem... I'm Mr. Ekoda. I'll be your classic literature teacher.   
We'll be learning all about good old Japan through some truly great stories. Exciting, right?   
   
Mr. Ekoda   
Now, some people say classic lit isn't relevant anymore, but oh, are they wrong!   
The students, the other teachers—they don't know what they're talking about! Nobody really understands it like they should...   
   
Mr. Ekoda   
Hey... Are you even listening to me?   
Let's wake up, shall we, children? Now, open your textbooks.   
First on our syllabus is Ise Monogatari, the origin of Japanese literature.   
It's a very interesting story. You youngsters might even call it "da bomb."   
*sigh* I can tell you people are "zoning out" on me...   
......   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
All right. Today, we'll be looking at some Meiji-era literature. Open your textbooks to page 12.   
...You know what? I'm sick of this story. I already went over it in the last class.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
I've got a great poem we can discuss instead. Close your textbooks, everyone, and listen to this...   
"Isolated cloud   
suspended over the tall   
snowy mountain peak"...   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Angry - Hey! Tomochika! You'd better not be sleeping back there!   
Angry - You should be ashamed of yourself, napping while I pour my heart into this reading!   
Angry - You're getting another essay on top of the regular assignment tonight!   
Angry - I expect a slice of cake when you turn it in, too!   
Angry - And don't cheap out with the store-bought stuff, like last time!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Happy - I'm Edogawa, and I'll be teaching... Oh, let's call it "integrative learning." Eeeheehee...   
My goal is to ease some of the stress you suffer as students, of which I assume there is plenty.   
Think of it as psychotherapy through magic!   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Yes, that's right. Quiet down. No talking... Silence, I say!   
Were you surprised to hear me bring magic up?   
Well, this study was very recently published, so it's not well known just yet...   
But, "those who believe will be saved." In other words, the placebo effect is hard at work.   
Happy - That means, believe your studies are paying off, and eventually, they will! Eeeheehee...   
All right then! Let's get on with our first lecture—the basics of magic.   
Who can use magic, and who cannot? That seems like a reasonable enough starting point.   
Some of you may think magic lets you do absolutely anything.   
Pulling pranks, raining vengeance on your enemies...   
Well, if those are the first wishes that run through your mind when it comes to magic, then I'll tell you now—you'll never master the craft.   
This is true of both Eastern and Western sorcery...   
Those with wicked hearts will be either powerless or driven to ruin.   
There's one more vital facet to learning magic...   
And that is the "master."   
Practitioners should always aspire to become as knowledgeable as their predecessors, especially if they intend to study high-level magic.   
But without a master's careful instruction, learning the craft becomes wholly impossible.   
Once you've begun your training, you'll have to live in two worlds at once: the real world, and the dark realm.   
If you ever lose the ability to distinguish between the two, then you'll be headed straight for disaster.   
That's what makes the guidance of a master absolutely vital!   
With all that out of the way, I'll move on to meditation, one of the standards in magical training.   
Now, I've got some handouts here for you...   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
...Well, looks like that's our time.   
If you think you might be interested in the practice, try meditating on the course of your day while lying in bed tonight.   
In vivid detail, recall each event taking place in reverse... Sort of like traveling back through time, in your mind.   
Happy - If you ever reach the point where you can do it flawlessly, you just may have what it takes to become a good magician! Eeeheehee...   
All right, that's it for today.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Ekoda   
I'm sure you all remember that **midterm exams start next Monday**.   
If you've paid attention during class and studied regularly at home, you shouldn't have any problems.   
Especially those of you who sleep through class. You must be preparing hard at home. Right, Iori?   
Hmph...   
Well, if you choose to throw the rest of your lives away by slacking off while you're students, then be my guest. Who am I to stop you...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
He's shaping up to make this a long one...   
   
Mr. Ekoda   
Back in my day, society was nowhere near as prosperous as it is now!   
That's why we all busted our humps for so long: to better the situation we were in! Well, can you young people say the same? Hmm?   
Our society's material wealth has cost us far too much spiritual wealth, if you ask me!   
On the other hand, in Ise Monogatari...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Miyahara   
Hmm? That's strange... I wasn't expecting the answer to be such a large integer.   
50 sextillion times 1,200?   
...60 septillion?   
Multiplied by 1,820...   
10 octillion, 920 septillion!?   
......   
These numbers are too big to fit on the board... Uhhh...   
   
Mr. Miyahara   
Oh! Wrong equation. If we instead use our variables in the right one...   
The answer comes out to 3.   
Ah, I see... This is a very elegant equation, actually!   
   
Mr. Miyahara   
Huh? What will the exam cover...? Oh, right—**exams start next Monday**.   
It'll just cover up to page 34, so this formula won't be on it.   
Kind of a shame, though. It's a real beauty.   
Maybe I should just put it on there anyway...   
Kidding! I'm kidding! Don't give me that look!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
All right class, settle down. You can show off your scores to each other later.   
Let's spend a bit of time going over the test now.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
The first part was the kanji dictation section...   
Angry - How did any of you get this part wrong? It was a gimme!   
Angry - I swear, you make me ashamed to be your teacher sometimes!   
Next was the short essay—your reaction to a passage about bullying in schools.   
These don't have a sole correct answer. You could write whatever comes to mind, as long as it's relevant!   
You could even write about something you'd never discuss aloud, like a complaint about bullying at Gekkoukan, for example...   
Though I'm sure that's not an issue in this class, right? Bear in mind, I hate cowards who resort to bullying.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Okay, on to the next section. Many of you got these wrong.   
Are we paying attention? Good. Now, you were asked to write the correct conjunction in each case...   
The first one's answer was "and," but if you wrote "however," you lucked out with some partial credit. I won't award it next time, though, got it?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Ono   
Let's see... Today, I'll be covering the Kofun period in our history.   
I dunno though... Do any of you think this stuff's relevant? I mean, I could slap together some clay statues that look a lot better than theirs did.   
I can't wait until we get to the Sengoku era... It's so much more exciting!   
Speaking of the Sengoku era, there was this one general they called "the war hawk of the battlefield."   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Looks like this turned into   
another Sengoku lecture...   
   
Mr. Ono   
...And that's how the period came to be known as the Sengoku era.   
Huh? You want to hear more about the Kofun period?   
Well, if you insist... Uh, go look up the Kitora Tomb in Nara. It's really famous.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Quiet down, class. It's time to begin today's lecture. "Progredio adio lucem siderem"...   
I'm changing today's lecture to another integrated learning one, since Mr. Ekoda left early today.   
He claimed he wasn't feeling well... Looked fine enough to me, though...   
Quick word of caution: make sure you know what you're eating before you take a bite.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
I covered the basics of learning magic last time...   
So today, I'll go a bit deeper into meditation.   
First, let's review the ways that magicians meditate.   
To heighten the creative impulse, the source of all your magical power...   
Observe a real-world object carefully, then re-create it in your mind, down to the last, tiny detail.   
That's the Western standard for meditation, but I'd like to talk about the Eastern style as well.   
Meditation was originally refined in the East...   
And modern magicians adapted Eastern meditation for their own original style.   
You find the right posture, take a deep breath in and out, and calm your mind.   
That's the basic practice of the Eastern style.   
It doesn't take much to practice meditation, either.   
All you need is some free time and a relatively calm environment.   
It doesn't take long, but you should give yourself at least fifteen minutes for a proper session.   
Now for the specifics... First, your posture. Just take a position that you find comfortable.   
Sitting cross-legged is good enough for most, but you can try the full-lotus position, too—it's sometimes called "kekkafuza."   
You can even meditate while sitting in a chair. Any position works as long as it's comfortable.   
Once your breathing is relaxed, close or cover your eyes and let the rest of your body relax too.   
Now that you've prepared yourself physically, you'll focus next on your mind and soul.   
Imagine a symbol—some simple image. Perhaps a large tree, or the moon.   
It could even be the god of your own faith, if you like.   
However, do not force yourself to fully empty your mind. That's actually a common misconception.   
Most people aren't even capable of it, but succeeding is especially dangerous. You run the risk of losing all control of yourself.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
...So, what have we learned? Meditation can be aided through iconography, rather than forcing an empty mind.   
Even Christian prayer can reach a level of meditation, if practiced fervently enough.   
Although, in that case, the imagined symbol is present for a reason other than meditational aid.   
It can be dangerous to plumb the depths of your consciousness...   
But, by keeping a clear symbol in mind, you avoid teetering over the edge and plunging into the darkness.   
Go ahead and try meditating tonight, if you'd like. All right, that's it for today.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Ekoda   
Ah... This phrase, "mono susamajiku," also appears in Ugetsu Monogatari.   
Of all the Ugetsu tales, I'm most fond of the one about the vengeful ghost wife.   
   
Mr. Ekoda   
Such an eerie, yet poignant story... Speaking of which, I've got a pretty good ghost story of my own. Care to hear it?   
   
Mr. Ekoda   
Then, my friend, the one who came with me into the tunnel, suddenly screamed...   
"There's a girl right behind you!"   
We ran back home, scared out of our wits... But, not long after that, I started hearing the strangest thumping noises coming from inside the wall!   
And the faintest voice, croaking... "Let me out... Let me out..."   
As far as I knew, that room had always been vacant. Who was in my wall?   
So, one night, I decided to go right up to the wall where the sounds came from, and knock on it!   
Heheheh...   
All of a sudden, right in my ear, I hear this girl's voice, loud and clear—"I'm heeere!"   
And that's where the youngest member of my family came from. She grew up to be just like any ordinary human, though.   
Nowadays, I only lie awake in fear that she'll run off and marry this loser she's been seeing...   
Oops, there's the bell. Okay, class, that's all for today.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Ono   
Are we up to the Kamakura era yet? I guess not... Oh man, we haven't even reached the Nara era!   
Well, let's just power through it real quick. First, the Taika Reforms!   
   
Mr. Ono   
They happened in the year 645.   
Just remember that and we can move on.   
Huh? What were they about? Oh, nothing major, really.   
Later on, in 710, there was the Heijo-Kyo. Okay, that wraps up the Nara era.   
   
Mr. Ono   
What, you actually want more? Okay, here's a question for you, then.   
What's the name of the anthology consisting of 4,500 poems, give or take, leading up to the Nara era?   
...You know what? I don't feel like picking on anyone today. I'll just tell you. It's the Man-yoshu.   
We're supposed to cover the Kokin Wakashu, too, but I don't really care. Ask Mr. Ekoda, if you want.   
Ughhh... I don't care about any of this!   
I just wanna get to the Sengoku era! I can hear it calling for me!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mrs. Terauchi   
**Exams are starting tomorrow**... Are you all ready?   
Summer vacation is just within reach, so you'd better study hard!   
   
Mrs. Terauchi   
Why aren't you excited!? You know, summer vacation! Beaches! Shaved ice! Woohoo!   
It's also the hottest time of the year, though. Don't go overheating, okay?   
Ah, that reminds me, there's an old expression for the hottest time of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.   
   
Mrs. Terauchi   
The "dog days" of summer. It goes all the way back to an ancient Latin phrase, the "puppy days."   
Any idea where that phrase came from? Anyone?   
Well, it's because Sirius—also called the Dog Star—appears at the start of summer. People believed it brought droughts and misfortune.   
Here's hoping we can avoid all that, I guess... Have a nice vacation!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Please take your seats. "Solve et coagula"—or "salve," rather.   
Your teacher has suddenly fallen ill, so I'll be filling in today.   
Happy - Sick, on the last day before summer vacation... That just shows you why you have to take good care of your health! Eeeheehee...   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Anyway, I'll be giving you all a crash course on alchemy, a branch of magic focused on, among other things, generating wealth.   
Oh, like the sound of that, do you? Of course. Who among us would turn down free money?   
It's human nature to want what one lacks. There's no escaping it.   
So, despite the lesson imparted to us by King Midas, humans have long sought a way to create precious metals for themselves.   
However, the alchemists of old were not so arrogant as to believe they could create gold by touching anything they pleased.   
Rather, they sought a process that allowed them to convert cheaper metals, such as iron or copper, into more lucrative ones.   
This goal is the pinnacle of alchemy given form: the philosopher's stone.   
Regardless of their incentive or their success, there is no denying that alchemists have made significant impacts in world history.   
The roots of alchemy originate in Hellenistic Egypt, with the city of Alexandria at its center.   
As the Western Roman Empire fell, alchemy thrived in Arabia. Many of the Arabic alchemical texts written at the time have survived to this day.   
The earliest English translations of these texts brought the practice to medieval Europe, where alchemists gained both power and infamy.   
Also of note, there is a fascinating branch of Chinese alchemy called Waidan.   
These practitioners sought a working formula for an elixir of immortality, though, rather than a recipe for gold.   
At any rate... the most important substance in the practice of alchemy is mercury, or quicksilver.   
It was thought that mercury could be used to form the philosopher's stone, which would in turn allow alchemists to generate gold.   
Alchemists endlessly toiled in their research, using all sorts of equipment and experimental approaches.   
There are some who argue that, if not for the alchemists' trial and error, modern chemistry would not exist as we know it today.   
Unfortunately, there's no definitive proof that a philosopher's stone was ever successfully created.   
In a way, it's one of the greatest tragedies of human history.   
Moving on—alchemy has also been very influential in the field of psychology.   
Carl Jung, among others, recognized a kinship between alchemists and psychologists.   
Jung believed that psychotherapy could refine a mind to a stronger, healthier state, not unlike how the philosopher's stone was said to affect metals...   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
...Which is why I think it's such a shame that mainstream society has given up on alchemy.   
Young adults ought to strive for unusual goals—it offers the best chance to lead exciting lives.   
And after all, from the perspective of our ancestors, modern science may as well be alchemy or magic.   
If you work hard enough, you may very well discover your own form of magic.   
Well, that's it for now. Enjoy your summer, everyone.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Ono   
All right, our next chapter goes over the problems of the Kamakura shogunate...   
   
Mr. Ono   
The Kamakura period's cool and all, but it doesn't beat the Sengoku era!   
Have we covered enough of this yet? I can skip to Sengoku now, yeah?   
Yeah, let's do it. We're taking a deep dive into the era, starting from the beginning.   
As I'm sure you all know, it's generally agreed upon that the major factor in the Sengoku era's formation was the Onin War, in 1467.   
After that, the next big one was the Coup of Meio, in 1493.   
Let's look a bit closer at the Onin War first, though. In 1467...   
   
Mr. Ono   
...Wow, it's already time? I can't believe that went by so fast!   
We've only made it to 1467, but there's still so much to cover... I guess there's no other choice.   
Next time, we'll jump ahead to 1468.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ms. Ounishi   
A lot of people are concerned about stress these days...   
Believe it or not, crying can relieve stress. The tension is washed away with all those tears.   
Unlike money, there're no benefits to saving up your stress. When life gets rough, just cry it out.   
   
Ms. Ounishi   
By the way—and maybe you've found this out already...   
We sometimes describe difficult situations as "headaches," but headaches caused by stress are a real thing.   
   
Ms. Ounishi   
Migraines are probably the most talked about of them all. Some people are more prone to getting them due to their personality and habits.   
There are also tension headaches. Those are really nasty too.   
Tension headaches are when the muscles of your head contract due to overloaded stress.   
That's why it's so important that you never bottle your stress up!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Miyahara   
We already covered how any number divided by 0 is undefined, right?   
Oh, we didn't? Was that the other class...?   
Well, either way, I just told you, so let's move on.   
   
Mr. Miyahara   
...For this next one, the answer is 8.   
Aww... Don't you think 8 is such a darling number?   
Almost as precious as 9's little curly tail.   
But oh, the 2! Not enough people appreciate it—2 is awesome!   
Aren't numbers just downright adorable!?   
   
Mr. Miyahara   
But then, on the other hand, things like the square root sign and the sigma have a much more refined feel to them.   
Pair them together with numbers and you can express anything in the world.   
Hearts, minds, emotions... Everything boils down to synapses firing in the brain.   
Which means they can be expressed by numbers! Isn't it amazing what those cute lil' digits can do?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Ono   
I finally get to tell you all about Masamune Date today!   
I was so excited last night, I couldn't sleep a wink!   
   
Mr. Ono   
Let's not waste any more time! We'll start with Date's early life.   
In 1567, at Yonezawa Castle...   
   
Mr. Ono   
...And at age fifteen, he emerged victorious from his very first battle!   
Thus began his rise to power— Huh? We're out of time...? What's your next class?   
Composition? Hmm... Ms. Toriumi, eh?   
Well, I'm sure she'll forgive me if I bring her some cake. So let's continue with...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
I hope you all haven't forgotten—**exams start in ten days**, a week from Tuesday.   
Angry - If this class does poorly, it'll fall on my head, so you'd better study hard!   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
With that out of the way, let's start on page 125. "The younger generation is creating its own language in cyberspace."   
I must admit, I'm no computer nerd, but I've become quite the master of the "leetspeak" you're all so fond of lately.   
I actually find it rather useful!   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
I've even cooked up some of my own Internet slang.   
Not only is it totally unreadable, it's impossible to tell whether it's gibberish or actual information!   
With my flair for cryptology, I could be a spy for the government... Yeah... Why not?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Takenozuka   
Did you write that down? You'd better hurry up, I'm about to erase it! Still writing? Hurry up!   
What have you been doing this whole time, texting or something?   
   
Mr. Takenozuka   
**Exams start next Tuesday**—there's no time to waste! Let's just move on to the next problem.   
   
Mr. Takenozuka   
Did you write that down? Okay, that was more than enough time. I'm going to erase it now! Really, I'm gonna do it!   
Oh, and I heard that one of you has been counting how many times I say "Did you write that down?" How about focusing on your notes!?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Ono   
Masamune Date decided to pursue Hideyoshi Toyotomi, so he headed for Odawara...   
Can you feel his heartrending sorrow that came from such a decision!?   
*sob* I wish I was born in that era! I could have fought alongside Masamune Date!   
   
Mr. Ono   
All right, now this turns into a real wild ride from here on. Blink and you might miss something!   
   
Mr. Ono   
Ah, the Sengoku era... The days when men were in their full glory!   
This modern age is terrible! Where has the samurai spirit gone!?   
Now, let's review what we've covered on the Sengoku era. First thing: no era was ever better. Secondly...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Class is now in session. "Salamander soll glühen"... Actually, I should go over the invocation later.   
Ms. Toriumi is feeling under the weather—again—so I'll be replacing her today.   
There's something about autumn that makes people overstuff themselves... Be sure you keep at least one eye on your intake.   
But this is ultimately to your benefit, thanks to the lesson I've prepared for today—all about summoning magic.   
This magic has been used throughout history to summon both angels and demons into our realm.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
But first: what is summoning magic, exactly?   
It's when a magician conjures a pre-existing spiritual presence. At times, they are also able to control the presence for their own goals.   
Just as with shamanism, spiritual summoning can be found throughout recorded history in a number of different cultures.   
Even today, it's widely seen in books, movies, video games, and whatnot.   
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust was instrumental in the popularization of summoning magic.   
There are plenty more examples of summoning magic I'd like to cover, but we only have so much time...   
I suppose I could power through a few of them, at least.   
Let's see... John Dee and Edward Kelley collaborated in Europe to summon an angel in the 16th century.   
Later, in the 19th century, the magician Éliphas Lévi summoned a spirit named Apollonius.   
Following in his footsteps, to a degree, was Aleister Crowley, who summoned Aiwass, his own "guardian angel," in the 20th century.   
What else...? Some Neoplatonist traditions engage in the practice of theurgy, focused on summoning guiding spirits called demons.   
In Haitian Vodou, the oungans—male priests—can summon spirits called loa, of which there are said to be over a thousand.   
As for Japan...   
In an esoteric form of Buddhism called Vajrayana, there are rituals that effectively function as summoning spells.   
By performing one of these rituals, practitioners attempt to invoke Buddha within themselves for assistance in real-world actions, such as healing.   
I could go on and on—there are countless examples of summoning magic in this world.   
The point is, after studying summoning in its many different forms long enough, you begin to see a pattern.   
Once magic circles, spells, and the like were established as necessary to summoning rituals, they grew more and more common, just as...   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
...But you should bear in mind: summoning isn't only used for deities and powerful beings. It can be used to invoke common spirits as well.   
Take the séance, for example. Or the Ouija board.   
Now, those rituals are comparatively easy to perform, and thus can be very tempting, but...!   
Happy - As I've told you many times already, do not try this at home! It could very well result in... unpleasantness. Eeeheehee...   
All right, that's it for today.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Settle down, everyone! Just because we have a new student, that doesn't give you license to misbehave!   
Anyone who doesn't pipe down now gets left out of the **school trip next week**! Got it?   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Good... Now, let's begin.   
Where did we leave off last time...? Ah, forget it. I don't need the textbook for this.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
"Indeed, 'twas I who found the corpse..."   
Angry - That's it! I'm not going to say it again: be quiet! The students who actually want to pay attention can't hear!   
Angry - If you must gossip about Mochizuki-kun, wait until the break! Or just talk to him yourself, then!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Let's begin today's lecture, shall we? "Om avirahûmkham vajradhâtu vam"...   
I'll be teaching today because... Well, maybe it's best that you don't know.   
Anyway, I'm filling in last-minute, so I didn't have much time to come up with a lesson plan...   
Happy - The first thing that came to mind was a lecture on practical magic.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
How about we discuss some breathing techniques?   
I know, some people would say breathing's anything but magic, but the two are actually closely linked.   
That's because breathing affects more than your body—it influences the mind as well.   
The ancient Greek word for breath is "pneuma." It was a very important concept in the medical science of the day.   
Later, Gnostic Christians used "pneuma" to refer to the human spirit—a concept separate from the soul.   
That was around the time when breathing techniques were recognized as being so crucial to successful magic.   
Happy - I could name all sorts of examples where this influence is felt today. Like yoga—breathing is an especially important factor there.   
There's also the Shinto concept of "ibuki," meaning both "breath" and "inner strength," that is often incorporated into martial arts training.   
So, you can see how breathing techniques have spread throughout the world thanks to the power of magic.   
But, back to practical matters... Let me show you something called dantian breathing.   
Some say Gautama Buddha himself practiced this method while on earth.   
Happy - It's a breathing exercise where you focus on a specific dantian, or energy center, in your body.   
So, the first step is simply focusing on the right dantian, as each person has multiple.   
For this exercise, focus on the lower one—it's about three finger-widths below the navel.   
Why does such a seemingly random spot on the body receive such high regard, to the point of being specially named?   
It's because the dantian is where the most energy can be charged within the body.   
Once you start the exercise, you might notice that the energy you send there can't be felt elsewhere in the body...   
This is because the dantian absorbs your spiritual energy, further strengthening the body and mind.   
Let's try doing some dantian breathing now.   
For first-timers, it's usually a good idea to place your hand in the proper spot. This helps to maintain focus.   
Once you've pinpointed your dantian, you can begin the breathing process.   
Imagine the air you pull in with your diaphragm is coalescing within the dantian...   
Then, just as deliberately, exhale through the nose.   
The goal with each breath is to channel energy into your dantian until you can feel it begin to harden—that's the point when you should exhale.   
And simply repeat this process as desired. That's all!   
Oh! Except, one important note...   
If you're doing it correctly, there shouldn't be any pain.   
After all, when you boil it down, you're simply breathing in and out.   
That means, if it hurts, then there's likely some sort of mental thing going on instead. Something inhibiting your mind...   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
...So you see how breathing methods affect meditation, making it crucial to magicians.   
Remember: it's very important to believe that you're doing more than just breathing.   
As a matter of fact, you can even improve your physical fitness with the right breathing techniques.   
And that leads, in turn, to the improvement of your psyche and your astral form.   
All right, that's it for today.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Ekoda   
Ahem... **Tomorrow, you leave on your field trip**. Ah, Kyoto... Home of my heart.   
Some teachers think you should be out visiting foreign countries, but I shut those ideas down every single year!   
It's shameful, the way we've lost our passion for our homeland!   
   
Mr. Ekoda   
Why don't we spend some time today learning about our country's innate beauty?   
I'm sure your other teachers haven't covered that at all, that's for sure...   
You all know that our national flower is the cherry blossom, right?   
However, back in the days of the Man-yoshu, if you were to ask someone what it was, they'd tell you it was the plum.   
   
Mr. Ekoda   
Anyway, so one day, my neighbor invited me over to her house...   
She fed me absolute gruel—I'll never forget the taste!   
Well, I still tried to offer her something in return, but she only kept waving off my gift!   
Humility is the true Japanese way! But not for you children today, no! You lot are nothing but...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
So, did you all enjoy the school trip? I sure didn't. I couldn't care less about shrines and temples...   
Well, **career experience week starts Tuesday**. Just think of it as another boring field trip, for social studies.   
Happy - It's pretty tough out there in the real world. If you don't know what I mean, by the end of the week, you will.   
Myself, though, I'm just happy I'll have the chance to relax...   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Does anyone have any fond memories from the trip they'd like to share with the class?   
...C'mon now, don't turn away from me!   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
...So, my idea for the school trip was Guam.   
But none of the other teachers agreed. In fact, they all had their own ideas.   
Mr. Ekoda stumped for Kyoto, like always. Mr. Ono wanted to go, um... somewhere northeast of Japan. I'm still not sure why...   
Ms. Ounishi suggested a hot spring, and Mr. Takenozuka wanted to ride the Maglev Train.   
Mrs. Terauchi didn't care where we went, as long as she could bring her husband. Man, is she annoying!   
What we need is someone to unite the rest of the staff against a certain someone. Then we can finally fight back against this annual Kyoto slog...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Ono   
**Exams start next Monday**, so today, I'll be covering some of the more historically significant years.   
   
Mr. Ono   
645 was the Taika Reform. 710 was when the Heijo-Kyo was established...   
794 was when the Heian-Kyo was established... Eh, I'm gonna skip ahead a few hundred years now.   
   
Mr. Ono   
1185 was the Battle of Dan-no-ura, and 1192's when the Kamakura shogunate was established.   
Ooh, we're real close to the age of the samurai now!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Takenozuka   
We're a little ahead of schedule, so let's do some review.   
   
Mr. Takenozuka   
When you see "electromagnetism," Lorentz Force and Fleming's left-hand rule should come to mind right away.   
I won't give partial credit if you write "right-hand rule," got it? Okay, moving on...   
   
Mr. Takenozuka   
Sorry, what was that again?   
"The Law of Happiness Without Hard Work"?   
*sigh* Do you really think I'll give you credit for calling some goofy wish a law? I'm clearing the blackboard now—hurry up and write!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mrs. Terauchi   
Today is December 24th. Christmas Eve... An important day in Europe and America.   
Although unlike in Japan, December 25th—Christmas Day—is even more important.   
   
Mrs. Terauchi   
Do you all know why we celebrate the holiday in the first place?   
In Japan, Christmas Eve is just a day for couples to spend time together and give gifts...   
   
Mrs. Terauchi   
And then, beneath the largest, most beautiful fir, we made a vow to love each other, unconditionally, forever and ever...   
The twinkling lights from the trees danced upon our faces as we gazed into each other's eyes... So romantic...!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Winter break starts tomorrow, though I'm sure most of you are just going to sleep in on New Year's, instead of actually doing anything.   
You should start the year by doing more for your parents. And don't pass out in your kotatsu staying up late, okay?   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Speaking of kotatsu, I'm reminded of a passage from a famous novel. "The shutters of the east window..."   
Oh, wait, that was a futon...   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Angry - All right, that's enough out of you smart-mouths! A futon is practically the same thing as a kotatsu!   
Angry - You're enjoying this, aren't you...?   
Angry - Look, all my point was, if you're not careful when you sleep in a kotatsu, you could get burned! Okay!? Now, that's the end of it!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ms. Ounishi   
Whew, it's cold... I wish I could get my skin plated.   
Then I'd shine as bright as the sun!   
   
Ms. Ounishi   
You know what I mean by plating, right? It's when objects are covered in a thin, metallic layer.   
Tin plating is done by plating iron with tin. For corrugated, galvanized iron, you plate iron with zinc.   
Gold medals, by the way, are created by plating silver with gold...   
So technically, Olympic athletes don't win gold medals.   
Kind of a bummer, right?   
   
Ms. Ounishi   
The night sky is awfully beautiful these days, thanks to the air being so clear.   
Stars produce light via nuclear fusion, and the planets reflect that light back out into the universe.   
Of course, neither celestial body is superior to the other—they both have their purposes.   
Life is the same way... Though it might be hard for you kids to understand that now.   
By the way, have you heard the news going around? The media makes it sound supernatural in origin...   
But don't listen to all that.   
These sorts of wild rumors spread every now and then, like a drop of dye on a specimen. It'll all die down soon enough.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Ono   
*sob* Finally, on September 24th, the Satsuma Rebellion ended...   
This marked the end... *sniff* The end of the age... of the samurai!   
You know what? I'm blowing off the next chapter. I wanna go back to the Sengoku era. There's so much more to cover...   
   
Mr. Ono   
What? You want me to teach you modern history, too?   
You guys are still in your second year! You'll have plenty of time to learn that crap when you're third-years!   
People out there might be talking about the end of the world, but believe you me, there'll always be another school year.   
I mean, come on! Has no one been paying attention? Look at all the stuff our country's survived so far!   
   
Mr. Ono   
All right, so let's review what we've learned, starting with the Kamakura era.   
How did the Kamakura shogunate come about? Let me tell you...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Miyahara   
It's been getting restless out there, huh? Have you seen all those flyers at the station?   
None of that stuff has any substance, though. You can tell there's no certainty in what they say.   
   
Mr. Miyahara   
That's right—it's a matter of probability! Hey, don't give me those looks.   
The end of the world... Let's discuss the odds.   
   
Mr. Miyahara   
So as you can see, it's impossible to irrefutably prove that the end of the world is nigh.   
That means there's no reason to worry about it! Instead, take a good look at the elegance of this proof...   
Numbers are truth, and truth is beauty! Even if the world ends, numbers will remain.   
Even if humans vanish, taking mathematics with them, the concept of numbers won't disappear.   
Numbers will outlast humanity, I guarantee it. So fascinating!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mrs. Terauchi   
Wow, we've already reached the last chapter. We were really efficient, thanks to all your diligence!   
   
Mrs. Terauchi   
So, my last day teaching here is coming up all too soon... I'll be moving to India in the spring.   
My darling came to Japan as a missionary, but he told me he just can't take life in this country anymore.   
"Too many mysterious incidents," he said. Don't get me wrong, though—I love Japan!   
Before I forget, I'd like to thank each of you for being such wonderful students.   
   
Mrs. Terauchi   
Thank you, Yukari. Thank you, Minato.   
Thank you, Junpei. And you too, Kenji.   
Thank you... *sniffle*   
*sob*   
Heh, I don't know what's come over me! I still have a month left here...   
But... thank you.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Well, today is the last composition class for January.   
As they say, January walks, and February runs—it'll be a whole new year in a flash.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
But before that, we've got our final exams, so don't relax just yet!   
Anyway, just look at me—I manage to come to school every day, so you can too.   
Even though if I had the choice, I'd have slept in at home... Too many scary people around town lately.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Those Apathy Syndrome rumors have been all over TV lately. Same with those cult members...   
How did things end up like this? Well, yesterday, I heard something intriguing...   
Someone on TV called it a disease born out of the times, where the darkness in someone's heart completely takes over.   
They said it's inevitable in a hopeless society like ours—that its victims are really the victims of society at large.   
But I think that's wrong. Everyone may have darkness in their hearts, but they fight it, right?   
I admit, hope isn't something you come across so easily in our society...   
But that hardly gives them license to give up! They should be able to stand on their own two feet!   
Anyway, that's my take on the matter.   
I hope you were paying attention, class. Something profound like that is bound to show up on the final exam.

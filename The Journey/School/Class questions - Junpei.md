Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I can hear my classmates whispering...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I've become slightly more popular...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I gave him the wrong answer...   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Open your textbooks and we'll take a look at the first novel by... Zenzou Kasai.   
Ugh... Why him?   
I've been more interested in Tota Kaneko's work lately.   
His essays are fantastic, and he's also a famous haiku poet.   
I wonder why all this isn't in the textbook... Well, I guess I'll just bring his book next time.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Speaking of haikus, they often use words or phrases related to seasons, but it's easy to get them mixed up.   
For example, you'd think "tasty bamboo shoots" and "vivid carp streamers" would symbolize spring, right?   
Well, they're actually related to summer!   
Haiku poets usually refer to seasons based on the lunar calendar, making it fairly complicated.   
...Hey, Iori, are you listening? Here's a question for you.   
Among these phrases, "a rain of flowers," "mystical mirage," and "vivid carp streamers," which one symbolizes summer?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Wh-Whuh? Uhhh...   
Surprised - Psst, Minato! You were listening, right!? Lend a brother a hand!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - What phrase symbolizes summer!?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
"A rain of flowers."   
"Mystical mirage."   
"Vivid carp streamers."   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Happy - Yep, that's right!   
Happy - So you were listening to me after all!   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Angry - Nope! I said that "vivid carp streamers" is related to summer just now, didn't I?   
Angry - Could you PLEASE pay attention to my lectures!?   
Angry - You'll make me cry if you keep this up! Listen closely next time!   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
By the way, "mystical mirage" and "a rain of flowers" represent spring.   
A mirage is a natural phenomenon that occurs around late March to early June...   
And "a rain of flowers" refers to the spring showers around the time cherry blossoms bloom. It's not literally raining flowers.   
Make sure you remember all that. Our next topic is...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Heheh... Well, you know how much I like to pay attention!   
Happy - Man, you seriously saved my bacon, Minato!   
   
Classmate   
Arisato-kun gave him the answer just now... He must have a good memory or something.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - O-Oh, uh... S-Sorry!   
Surprised - I ain't lettin' this go, man!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Miyahara   
All right, let's review quadratic functions. You all remember those, don't you?   
Sometimes the graph will be a parabola, or sometimes a hyperbola.   
Well, they're certainly beautiful curves... But they can't measure up to parabolic and hyperbolic spirals!   
These are algebraic spirals. Look, aren't they magnificent?   
   
Mr. Miyahara   
Now then, let's see if you can answer this from a mathematical point of view, Iori-kun.   
Which of the following is not an algebraic spiral?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - H-Hold up, how the heck am I supposed to know something like that!?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Minato, do you know which one's not an algebraic spiral or whatever?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
A.   
B.   
C.   
D.   
   
Mr. Miyahara   
Correct! Well done!   
This is a logarithmic spiral. When the golden ratio is the growth factor, it's called a golden spiral.   
   
Mr. Miyahara   
Too bad, the correct answer is A.   
This is a logarithmic spiral. When the golden ratio is the growth factor, it's called a golden spiral.   
   
Mr. Miyahara   
Just as the name implies, you can graph an algebraic spiral using an algebraic equation.   
B is the Archimedean spiral, C is a parabolic spiral, and D is a lituus. All of which are algebraic spirals.   
However, A, the logarithmic spiral, is not considered an algebraic spiral.   
It is a common spiral found in nature, such as on nautilus shells and sunflower seeds.   
No matter how far you scale in or out, the shape remains roughly the same. This is called self-similarity.   
   
Junpei Iori   
The way it spirals kinda reminds me of Tartarus...   
Happy - ...What, just me? Eh. Anyways, thanks for your help, dude!   
   
Classmate   
Arisato-kun gave him the answer just now. He must be really smart!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh, actually... don't it kinda look like Tartarus? Who the heck even made that place?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Miyahara   
Oh gosh... Cartesian coordinates really are beautiful, aren't they?   
There is one in particular that's my favorite though... Are you curious? You are, right? Right?   
   
Mr. Miyahara   
This curve is a graph of a Cartesian equation...   
One that was discovered by Italian mathematician Maria Agnesi.   
It's actually named after her. Some people call it the curve of Agnesi.   
However, it is more commonly known by another name. Iori-kun, do you have any idea what it is?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Huh!? How would I know!? Heck, are we even talkin' about math anymore?   
Sad - Psst, Minato... Do you know the answer?   
   
Junpei Iori   
What else do people call this curve?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Orthogonal curves.   
Fermat's spiral.   
Witch of Agnesi.   
   
Mr. Miyahara   
That's correct! I'm surprised you even knew that.   
   
Mr. Miyahara   
Hm, that's not correct. Was my question too difficult?   
The curve of Agnesi is more famously known as the Witch of Agnesi.   
   
Mr. Miyahara   
As to why it's called a "witch"...   
Nobody really knows! Apparently, it came from a mistranslation of the Italian word for the versine of a curve.   
Merely an inadvertent mistake, I suppose!   
I make careless mistakes fairly often as well... But it's pretty embarrassing when your mistake lasts for generations.   
I mean, if the shape of the curve resembled a witch, maybe they could have gotten away with it, but... alas.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Haha, that's just common sense, Mr. M!   
Happy - Phew... Thanks, Minato! I was about to sound real stupid.   
   
Classmate   
Arisato-kun helped him out there. Seems like you can always count on him.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - ...Yo, how were we supposed to figure that out without any hints?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Takenozuka   
Everyone understand the Lorentz force and the left-hand rule? Then I'm erasing the board!   
Hopefully, all of you have been taking notes because it might be on the **exam in two weeks**.   
My shoulders feel lighter than usual today. I can even erase the top of the blackboard with ease.   
Perhaps it's because I went to the bathhouse yesterday. I had a nice, long massage in the whirlpool bath.   
   
Mr. Takenozuka   
Which brings us to my next question...   
When streams of air bubbles from a whirlpool bath hit you, your body vibrates, yes?   
There's actually a name for this phenomenon. Iori, perhaps you know what it is?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Uhhh... Dude, how would I know?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Hey, you got any idea, Minato?   
Sad - What's it called when the air bubbles in a whirlpool bath hit you and make your body vibrate?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
The anchor effect.   
The flutter effect.   
The bubble jet phenomenon.   
   
Mr. Takenozuka   
Oh, I suppose you already knew. That's right, the answer is indeed "the flutter effect."   
"Flutter" refers to the small vibrations generated by interactions between airflow and other forces.   
   
Mr. Takenozuka   
...That's incorrect. The answer I'm looking for is "the flutter effect."   
"Flutter" refers to the small vibrations generated by interactions between airflow and other forces.   
   
Mr. Takenozuka   
It's not just whirlpool baths that have benefits. Do you ever feel itchy after taking a regular bath?   
It's said taking a warm bath can improve blood circulation throughout the body.   
And as the body warms up, the blood vessels dilate, flushing your body of toxins all at once...   
Heat can stimulate the secretion of histamine, which often makes the body itch.   
Hot baths may feel marvelous, but it's best to take them in moderation. Lukewarm water, on the other hand, helps cleanse the skin—   
   
...Ahem, I digress. Now then, let's get back to class. Open your books to page 8...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Man, now I wanna try taking a dip in a whirlpool bath... Think we could ask Kirijo-senpai for one in the dorm?   
   
Classmate   
Arisato-kun gave him the answer just now. He must be really smart!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - This ain't gonna be on the test, right? I mean, we were just talkin' about baths...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Ekoda   
As you all should know, there are many theories about the author, Murasaki Shikibu.   
That The Tale of Genji was authored by someone else... That "Murasaki Shikibu" was a shared pen name...   
Some have even suggested that Murasaki Shikibu was an alien from outer space. A truly intriguing theory...   
You've probably seen her portrait. It's printed on the 2,000-yen bill.   
Well, since we're on the topic of Murasaki Shikibu, here's a question regarding The Tale of Genji.   
   
Mr. Ekoda   
"Thou shalt not recite such a tale of this world before the princess"...   
Now, what such tale does this quote refer to? Iori? Go on and answer.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh? Me?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - H-Hey, lend me a hand here, Minato. What kinda tale is he talkin' about?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
About a peaceful world.   
About public opinion.   
About romance.   
   
Mr. Ekoda   
Correct. Too easy, was it?   
   
Mr. Ekoda   
That's... not correct.   
I cannot possibly wait to see what tales you will write on the next exam...   
   
Mr. Ekoda   
The "world" used in this sentence refers to the world of relationships and romance.   
Therefore, he is told not to read tales of romance in front of the princess.   
However, "world" can also refer to "society" or "mankind," like how it's often used today.   
Make sure you read it correctly based on the given context. Now on to the next one...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Phew... Thanks, Minato. You're a lifesaver.   
   
Classmate   
Arisato-kun really got Iori out of a pinch back there. He's such a nice guy!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Grrr... Stupid ol' Ekoda...   
Angry - Ain't nobody gonna use The Tale of Genji in the future, dammit!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mrs. Terauchi   
Let's take a look at some English idioms.   
When someone has a "big mouth," it means they're a loudmouth or a boastful person.   
   
Mrs. Terauchi   
There's also the phrase "spill the beans"...   
What exactly does this idiom mean? Junpei, why don't you answer?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh...? Me?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - H-Hey, Minato, do you know what it means to "spill the beans"?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
To drop money.   
To break into a smile.   
To reveal a secret.   
   
Mrs. Terauchi   
Yes! That's correct.   
   
Mrs. Terauchi   
Oh no, no, Junpei! When you "spill the beans," that means you "reveal a secret."   
   
Mrs. Terauchi   
There are many theories about why the word "beans" is used.   
One particularly famous theory says that beans were used to vote in ancient Greece.   
At that time, they'd put white beans for "yes" and black beans for "no" into the ballot box...   
And if you spill the beans before voting, it'd reveal their color, and your once "secret" vote.   
Oh, that reminds me! Last time, my darling...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Phew... Thanks, Minato.   
   
Classmate   
Arisato-kun gave him the answer just now. He must be really smart!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Well, no point cryin' over spilled milk, I guess.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
**Exams start on Monday**. Have you guys been studying? I'm the one who takes the fall if you don't score well, you know.   
Open your textbooks for today's lesson on... incorrect use of the plural form.   
These can trip up a lot of people.   
The most common forms end in "-s," "-es," and "-ies."   
Got it?   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Angry - However, there are some irregular plural forms too.   
You seem confused, Iori-kun.   
Do you know which of the following is an irregular plural noun?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Wha—? Huh? Me!? Ugh... I wasn't listening at all.   
   
Junpei Iori   
...Minato, help me out, man!   
Did you catch what she said? Do you know the answer?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Wishes.   
Lives.   
Dreams.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Oh, so you were listening. You've got a funny way of showing it, though...   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Angry - Wrong! The answer is "Lives."   
Angry - Stop daydreaming and pay attention!   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Like most singular nouns, you can add an "-s" to "dream" to form "dreams."   
Since "wish" ends in an "-sh," you have to add "-es" to get its plural form: "wishes."   
Okay, on to the next one...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Man... I sure wish they'd stop calling me out...   
...Thanks, Minato. You're a real homie.   
   
Classmate   
Arisato-kun really got Iori out of a pinch just now. He's such a nice guy!   
   
Junpei Iori   
"Daydreaming"...? I guess I was, but you gotta get your head outta the clouds, too, man.

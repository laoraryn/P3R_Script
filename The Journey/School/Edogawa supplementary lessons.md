Mr. Edogawa   
Happy - What brings you to the nurse's office? Eeeheehee...   
Happy - Ahhh, you've come for a supplementary lesson...? You're quite the promising pupil.   
Perhaps this one may even...   
Happy - Ah, pay no mind to the mutterings of a kindly nurse... Eeeheehee...   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
I must ask...   
You wouldn't happen to have your own deck of tarot cards? Don't lie... I can smell them on you.   
Do you consult them regularly? If you own a deck and you don't use it, it's a shameful waste!   
...Though while we're on the subject, how about a detailed lesson on the use of the tarot?   
I warn you, it's a complicated subject, and will take some time... Do you want to hear it?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'd like to hear it.   
No thanks.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Very well, then. Your fate is sealed... Eeeheehee...   
Today we will examine the most common use of the tarot, reading one's fate...   
Or as it's more commonly known, fortune telling.   
For now, let's keep to the simple one-card spread, where you draw and interpret a single card.   
It will suffice for learning the basic methods of the tarot.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Now, a quick word on the deck... For the best results, you'll want to use all 78 cards.   
But for today's explanation, we'll limit ourselves to the 22 Major Arcana.   
The procedure for telling fortunes via the tarot goes like so: shuffle, cut, spread, and read.   
That means mixing them all up, putting them in a pile, lining up the drawn cards, and examining them.   
When I say "spread," I refer to how they will be presented. It's a concept I'll come back to several times.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
...Ah, I nearly forgot about the necessary preparation before handling the cards.   
Before one begins a tarot reading, one's mind must be calm.   
Try to simultaneously unify and relax your consciousness.   
You must also stay focused on the goal of your reading, to avoid wishful thinking clouding the result.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Once you're relaxed, we'll begin.   
Place the cards facedown on the table to hide their images...   
Then the client of the reading will shuffle, or mix, the cards.   
If you're reading your own fortune, then you perform this step yourself.   
The most common method is to spread them on the table, mixing them in a circular motion with your left hand.   
The left hand is the agent of the subconscious mind, you see. Eeeheehee...   
Though if you're clumsy, or have lost a hand, or what have you, you can use either or both hands. It all depends.   
When the client is satisfied, make a single pile, and thus complete the shuffling phase.   
...And by "pile," I mean a neat, orderly stack.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Now, on to cutting the deck.   
Split the stack you've made into three piles, each roughly the same height.   
Normally the client also performs the cut, but the fortune-teller is free to perform this step as well.   
Just allow the spirit to move you.   
It may be your own feelings, and it may be occult inspiration...   
Reorganize the three piles in the order of your choosing, and combine them into one pile again.   
Once this is complete, the reader should take the pile.   
Be very careful during this step. You must preserve the direction the cards originally faced.   
If the client is someone else, turn the pile so the cards face the same direction that they were to you.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
And now, it's finally time to draw a card. This is the spread phase.   
We're doing a one-card spread, so turn over the top card, and place it on the field to the side.   
In some methods, you specify which card from the top... But that's a topic for another time.   
The card on the field provides the answer to the client's question.   
Now, at last, the reading phase.   
First, we must understand the card's meaning.   
What the card represents depends on if it's reversed or not...   
You do remember that much, yes?   
There are a few exceptions, but in general, a reversed card is negative, and has a different meaning.   
Once you understand the meaning of the card drawn, apply it to your question...   
Let inspiration rise to the surface of your mind, and... well...   
Form a story around it!   
I'll say it once more: develop your story around it! A story, I say!   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
A story! Your story! Our— *ahem* *ahem*   
Excuse me... I went too far.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Regardless, simply telling the client the card's meaning isn't considered a true reading.   
Using the clue derived from the card, the reader must use their inspiration to look into the client's future.   
It's important to converse with the client as well, to assist with your divinations.   
Tarot is both a skill of reading the cards and reading people... Hmm, perhaps I should save this for posterity.   
...What's that? Each card's meaning? Didn't I hand out notes on that before?   
If you've lost them, you're on your own... Research that information on your own time.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Well, I think that's enough of an explanation for today...   
Oh yes, one more thing. Always seal your inspiration after the fortune has been told.   
Say farewell to the cards, for instance, or imagine cocooning yourself in a sleeping bag.   
If you don't seal your inspiration, it may draw unwanted attention...   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Whew... Talking so much at once is quite draining.   
Since you've been taking your studies so seriously, here's a little something. Take it, and off you go.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Well then... Shall we continue where we left off last time?   
I have a lot to cover, so I hope you're prepared.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'm prepared.   
No thanks.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
I like your spirit!   
We've covered the fundamentals, so now I'll teach you how to use all 78 Major and Minor Arcana...   
Let's talk about the basic spread, shall we?   
To review, the tarot is made of 22 Major Arcana and 56 Minor Arcana...   
For a total of 78 cards. Is that clear?   
Each card has its own inherent meaning.   
Many are daunted by the full deck, because of the sheer amount of cards... but take heart!   
It is difficult to learn all the meanings, but having them all actually makes your reading easier.   
The more details one has available, the easier it is to craft a story...   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
I already explained the Major Arcana, so let me give you an outline of the Minor Arcana.   
The Minor Arcana are divided into four classes, called suits.   
Do you recall when I told you that this is what common playing cards were modeled after?   
The Wands, Cups, Swords, and Coins correspond to Clubs, Hearts, Spades, and Diamonds.   
Each suit has 10 numbered cards, ranging from Ace to 10...   
As well as four face cards—King, Queen, Knight, and Page—unlike the three face cards in common decks.   
The Page is sometimes called Prince, though he's essentially a knight in training.   
The four face cards are called court cards. That term will come up again, so remember it well.   
There are 14 types in total, between the pip cards or number cards, and the face or court cards.   
These 14 types have four cards each, for a total of 56 cards in the Minor Arcana.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
And now you know the makeup of the Minor Arcana. As for how to use them in a reading...   
It's actually the same as the Major Arcana.   
Keep in mind the meaning of each card and the direction it faces, and use your inspiration to create a story.   
In the Minor Arcana, each suit, number, and court type has its own meaning.   
One of the best ways to memorize these is to imagine them in a 4-by-14 grid.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
And now, each of the four suits' meanings, in brief...   
Wands for planning and growth, Cups for love and sentiment, Swords for trials, and Coins for wealth.   
As for the basic meaning of each of the numbered cards...   
Ace is the beginning, 2 is balance, 3 is growth, 4 is stability, 5 is change, 6 is balance again...   
7 is a new start, 8 is success, 9 is attainment, and 10 marks a terminus, or the end.   
Court cards represent people and their strengths. It could be the client, or other people involved.   
The Page represents children, and the offering of knowledge. The Knight is youth and boundless energy.   
The Queen represents adult women, while the King represents mature men.   
It's said that to grasp the meaning of the cards, it's important to communicate with them...   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Now then, let's move on to the method of using the full Arcana to tell fortunes.   
The basic procedure is the same... You'll just be using more cards.   
Even with the full deck of 78, you must first shuffle, then cut, spread, and read.   
The type of spread you use affects the procedure more than the number of cards in use.   
Don't get me wrong... The spread I'll be covering is done with this procedure, too.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Now, for a change of subject... I'll explain the various types of spreads.   
Last time we used the one-card spread, so today we'll examine the other typical spreads.   
First, remember that the spread is chosen according to the nature of the question.   
Do you want an answer to a single question? Or maybe an overview of the general future?   
Use the spread that best fits the request you have in mind.   
For example, if you want to tell the client's past, present, and future...   
Why not use a three-card spread, where you simply lay out three cards?   
Adding a card produces the four-card spread, identifying the past, present, nature of the problem, and future.   
If you use the seven-card hexagram spread, with a single card placed in the center of a hexagon...   
You can read both the nature of the problem and a countermeasure against it.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
There is also a spread called Question and Answer, involving two choices.   
This reading is done by setting two countermeasures against the question.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Finally, the most well-known spread is the classic Celtic Cross.   
It's suited to telling fortunes with only the Major Arcana, and is used often by both beginners and experts.   
Arrange two cards crossing each other in the center, then one more on all four sides of the cross...   
Then, place a pillar of four cards, known as the Spear of Destiny, next to it to the right.   
The cross of six cards represents the overall situation, with the four to the right making it concrete.   
Again, this forms the 10-card spread known as the Celtic Cross.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
There are other spreads, like the Horseshoe, Witch's Diamond, or the Seven Candles of Life...   
And I've also heard rumors of so-called normal, triangle, and cross spreads.   
There are far too many for me to teach you, so you can look into it yourself if you're interested.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Whew... I believe it's time for my afternoon tea.   
That's it for today. Here, take this and off you go.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Hmm, I feel like killing some time with a nice, meaty lecture about the tarot...   
How about it? Up for another mammoth lecture? Eeeheehee...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'm up for it.   
No thanks.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Happy - Then you're an uncommonly bored student! It's a wise use of your time, though. Eeeheehee...   
Today, we'll talk about a slightly advanced way of reading the tarot.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
I want to explain how to lower the probability of external factors, while being able to foresee a more solid future.   
Basically, it's a way to combine the power of tarot with other precognitive methods.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
The result is kind of a compound method of telling fortunes.   
The most well-known fusion with tarot is astrology.   
For example, there's the almost self-explanatory Horoscope Spread.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
After shuffling and cutting the full deck of 78...   
Spread them in a circle consisting of 12 cards, then place one more in the center.   
The 12 in the outer circle correspond directly to the 12 signs of the zodiac, also known as Houses.   
Each House shows an answer to a different problem, such as family and work, marriage, friendship, and money.   
The card in the center represents your overall fortune.   
This spread has a variety of uses, since you can gain an overall understanding of life.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Ah, yes—I forgot to mention the significator.   
It's used by those more accustomed to reading the tarot, but...   
Before shuffling, you choose one card that best fits the client's image and place it on the field.   
This is the significator.   
It's very effective in heightening the client's inspiration.   
Do you remember the court, or face, cards? The significator is selected from the Minor Arcana face cards.   
For a high schooler, the Page card would be best. For an adult, the Knight, King, or Queen would do it.   
More experienced readers may use one of the Major Arcana, but the court cards are suitable most of the time.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Now, back to ways of fusing the tarot with other fortune-telling methods...   
An even more advanced application would be to use it in conjunction with dowsing.   
That would be using a pendulum to find what you're looking for.   
Make a number of piles, with the cards facedown of course, and perform the dowsing ritual on them.   
If the client's significator is found in the selected pile, you continue with the reading.   
If not, try again until you do. This is to confirm that your inspiration has been heightened.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Let's see, what else...? Some elementary understanding of Hermetic Qabalah may be in order first.   
The spread based on the shape of the Qabalistic tree of life is another well-known method.   
It's a spread where you distribute the cards according to the ten trees of life, or the Sefirot.   
However, to actually put this method into practice, one needs a deep understanding of Qabalah.   
Not only do the positions of the cards have meaning, but the lines or paths connecting them do as well.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
For example, Chokmah, Chesed, and Netzach on the right represent the conscious...   
While Binah, Gevurah, and Hod on the left represent the unconscious.   
The balance in between them is represented by the paths of Keter, Tiferet, Yesod, and Malkuth.   
Proximity to Keter at the top reveals the spiritual side, with Malkuth on the bottom showing the bodily side.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Hmm... Yes, I'm afraid it's much too esoteric to fully explain. It has depths one cannot begin to guess at.   
I, too, have learned something by telling you all this—bringing out hidden knowledge is not easy.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Thus, that concludes the lecture. Thanks for paying attention.   
Happy - Well, **if you ever want to hear it again, I won't mind giving you a little refresher course next time**. Eeeheehee...   
Here's the usual—a gift for you, O studious one.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
I see... Then let's not waste one another's time, hmm?   
I don't need ditching students in my office. Out you go, shoo!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Happy - What brings you to the nurse's office? Eeeheehee...   
My, you want another of my supplementary lessons? You are the quintessential student...   
Or, could it be...?   
Ah, don't worry, I was just talking to myself.   
So, what do you want to review?

Tarot procedures   
The Arcana and basic spread   
Advanced readings   
Never mind   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Well then, I'll tell you once again about the procedure for a standard tarot reading.   
For now, let's keep to the simple one-card spread, where you draw and interpret a single card.   
It will suffice for learning the basic methods of the tarot.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Now, a quick word on the deck... For the best results, you'll want to use all 78 cards.   
But for this explanation, we'll limit ourselves to the 22 Major Arcana.   
The procedure for telling fortunes via the tarot goes like so: shuffle, cut, spread, and read.   
That means mixing them all up, putting them in a pile, lining up the drawn cards, and examining them.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
When I say "spread," I refer to how they will be presented. It's a concept I'll come back to several times.

A "pile" meaning a neat, orderly stack. You remember this, don't you?   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Now, on to cutting the deck.   
Split the stack you've made into three piles, each roughly the same height.   
Normally the client also performs the cut, but the fortune-teller is free to perform this step as well.   
Just allow the spirit to move you.   
It may be your own feelings, and it may be occult inspiration...   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Reorganize the three piles in the order of your choosing, and combine them into one pile again.   
Once this is complete, the reader should take the pile.   
Be very careful during this step. You must preserve the direction the cards originally faced.   
If the client is someone else, turn the pile so the cards face the same direction that they were to you.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
And now, it's finally time to draw a card. This is the spread phase.   
We're doing a one-card spread, so turn over the top card, and place it on the field to the side.   
In some methods, you specify which card from the top... But that's a topic for another time.   
The card on the field provides the answer to the client's question.

Mr. Edogawa   
It's important to converse with the client as well, to assist with your divinations.   
Tarot is about both reading the cards and reading people.   
As for the meaning of each card, look them up on your own time. Eeeheehee...   
And that's all we covered on the basic procedures of tarot readings.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
My throat's starting to hurt, so come back later if you want to hear about another subject.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
I'll tell you again about how to use all 78 Major and Minor Arcana, as well as the basic spread.   
To review, the tarot is made of 22 Major Arcana and 56 Minor Arcana...   
For a total of 78 cards. Is that clear?

One of the best ways to memorize these is to imagine them in a 4-by-14 grid.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
And now, each of the four suits' meanings, in brief...   
Wands for planning and growth, Cups for love and sentiment, Swords for trials, and Coins for wealth.   
As for the basic meaning of each of the numbered cards...   
Ace is the beginning, 2 is balance, 3 is growth, 4 is stability, 5 is change, 6 is balance again...   
7 is a new start, 8 is success, 9 is attainment, and 10 marks a terminus, or the end.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Court cards represent people and their strengths. It could be the client, or other people involved.   
The Page represents children, and the offering of knowledge. The Knight is youth and boundless energy.   
The Queen represents adult women, while the King represents mature men.   
It's said that to grasp the meaning of the cards, it's important to communicate with them...

Mr. Edogawa   
There are other spreads, like the Horseshoe, Witch's Diamond, or the Seven Candles of Life...   
And also the normal, triangle, and cross spreads.   
I remember telling you there were far too many types of spreads to go into detail on all of them.   
And that concludes my lecture on the Major and Minor Arcana, plus the basic types of spreads.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Pluto calls, so you'll have to ask me about the other lectures next time.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Since you seem interested in hearing it again, we'll go over advanced tarot readings.   
Remember, it's about combining other forms of fortune telling with the tarot deck.

Mr. Edogawa   
Now, back to ways of fusing the tarot with other fortune-telling methods...   
An even more advanced application would be to use it in conjunction with dowsing.   
That would be using a pendulum to find what you're looking for.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Make a number of piles, with the cards facedown of course, and perform the dowsing ritual on them.   
If the client's significator is found in the selected pile, you continue with the reading.   
If not, try again until you do. This is to confirm that your inspiration has been heightened.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Next, some elementary understanding of the Hermetic Qabalah.   
The spread based on the shape of the Qabalistic tree of life is another well-known method.   
It's a spread where you distribute the cards according to the ten trees of life, or the Sefirot.   
However, to actually put this method into practice, one needs a deep understanding of Qabalah.   
Not only do the positions of the cards have meaning, but the lines or paths connecting them do as well.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
For example, Chokmah, Chesed, and Netzach on the right represent the conscious...   
While Binah, Gevurah, and Hod on the left represent the unconscious.   
The balance in between them is represented by the paths of Keter, Tiferet, Yesod, and Malkuth.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Proximity to Keter at the top reveals the spiritual side, with Malkuth on the bottom showing the bodily side.   
I believe that's all we went over... And so ends our review on advanced tarot readings.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
I have exciting business to take care of today, so ask me about the other lectures some other time.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Ah, is that so? Then please scurry on home.   
I don't need ditching students in my office. Out you go, shoo!

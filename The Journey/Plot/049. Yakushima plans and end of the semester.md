Sad - ...Welcome back.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - ......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ......   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
What's wrong? You all hungry or something?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - N-Not really...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
......   
An awkward silence fills the room.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Umm...   
Y-You know, it's almost summer break.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh yeah, it is, huh...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Does anyone have any plans?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - I wish I could go to the beach. Hot sand, cool breeze... babes in bikinis...   
Happy - Man, a break like that sure would be nice!   
Happy - Somewhere in the south, where the water is crystal clear!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - But starting tomorrow, we gotta get through our exams... Aw man, this sucks.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I'm sure you'll be fine.   
Happy - But it would be nice to go somewhere with beautiful beaches. Like Okinawa!   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Well, it's not Okinawa, but how about Yakushima?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Mr. Chairman. I didn't realize you were here.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - I happened to be in the area, so I thought I'd drop by and tell you my schedule for next week.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Oh, Kirijo-kun. Your father will be vacationing in Yakushima during the break.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
He... He will...?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - You'll all have some time off after exams, right? Why don't you go and get a nice change of scenery?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Seriously? We're gonna go on a trip!?   
Happy - YESSS! Beaches and bikinis! Beaches and bikinis!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Beaches and bikinis. This guy...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Hehe.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
How about it, Kirijo-kun?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Well... My father is a busy man. I don't want to ruin his vacation.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - Hah! Why so hesitant?   
Happy - No father would be upset with a daughter who came all that way to see him.   
You've all done a great job. You deserve to relax for a while.   
And we already know when the next operation will be, so I think it'll be fine.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - I don't know...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Senpai! I'm beggin' ya!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
......   
Happy - All right.   
Happy - I guess everyone needs a break now and then. Let's do it.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo

Junpei Iori   
Happy - Woohoo!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
The beach, huh...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - I should design a special training regimen.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oh man, I can't wait!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, I need to go buy a swimsuit.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Hey, don't worry! I got one you can borrow!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Exasperated* - Nice try.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Are you going to swim too, Mr. Chairman?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Exasperated* - I'm afraid I can't. I'll turn to dust if I'm exposed to sunlight.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Wait, seriously!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Exasperated* - Don't be stupid.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - ......   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Kirijo-senpai, wait up!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Uh...   
Sad - I just wanted to say sorry about the other day.   
Sad - I might have gotten a little carried away.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Don't worry about it.   
In a way, it's only logical that we go to Yakushima.   
The chairman said that no one who was responsible for the accident survived, but...   
Sad - There is one who did.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - What? There is?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
My father.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - I had no idea...

Junpei Iori   
Happy - I'm done, babyyy!!!   
Exasperated* - The dark days of testing are finally over! The sun is shinin' bright!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
So, how'd you do?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - You are not gonna believe this! I aced P.E.!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Well, that pretty much answers my question.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Scheming - Whatever, a real man doesn't dwell on the past.   
Happy - I'm already thinking ahead to the blue skies of Yakushima!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh yeah, that's coming up soon, huh.   
Are you all ready to go?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yep.   
Nope.   
How 'bout you?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Yeah, I guess I should start getting ready, too.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Why am I not surprised? If it makes you feel any better, I'm not ready either.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Me? Um, not really...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, sorry. I don't sound very enthusiastic, do I?   
Happy - Hey, how about we stop somewhere on the way back? I don't have practice today.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Sounds good! Where we goin'?   
Happy - If you need to buy a swimsuit, I'd be happy to help!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Very funny.   
All right, gimme a sec. I'm gonna go grab my stuff from the locker room.   
Oh, I'll invite Fuuka too.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Hey, uh...   
Sad - I know I've been kind of a dick lately...   
Sad - So, uh... Sorry about that.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Don't worry about it.   
Yeah, I'm used to it.   
Huh?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Haha, alright.   
Let's put this whole thing behind us. Cool?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Dude! I'm tryin' to be serious, here.   
Let's just put this whole thing behind us. Cool?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - ...Oh. Okay.   
Sad - I forgot that's the kind of guy you were. Well, not that I'm complaining.   
Let's put this whole thing behind us. Cool?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Alright, let's get outta here.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - The Fortune Arcana... is gone!? The Strength Arcana must have done something!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - There's no way to attack it now. You'll have to defeat the Strength Arcana first!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Wh-What's this!? Roulette...!?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - What the heck just happened...?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - That roulette... It looks like wherever it stops, it will activate a different effect!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Red hurts, and blue helps... Allies and enemies—it doesn't discriminate!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - Where it stops is random, and I can't predict it. But... either way, be careful!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hurt - An attack left to fate, targeting both friend and foe... Can that still be called an attack?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Hurt - The Strength Arcana seems confident in its power. Don't be fooled by its appearance!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - The Strength Arcana possesses immense fortitude...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - Strength has been defeated! I can detect Fortune's presence again!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - Your attacks should land now!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - I have a really bad feeling about this roulette board...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - H-Huh...? Nothing's happening?

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - A misfire, huh? I've had enough of gambling with fate. Let's take it down!

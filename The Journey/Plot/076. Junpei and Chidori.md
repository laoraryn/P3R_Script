Junpei Iori   
Happy - Yo, Chidori.   
Happy - How's your hand doing?   
   
Chidori   
......   
   
Junpei Iori   
What the—? There's no scar... Not even a mark?   
Maybe it wasn't that bad...?   
   
Chidori   
......   
Say, Junpei... What do you do to make yourself feel alive?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Uh, I dunno... Breathe, I guess?   
Happy - Y'know, I can't say I've ever thought about it.   
Happy - How 'bout you, Chidori? Is that how you feel when you draw?   
   
Chidori   
Sad - I don't know... Most of these are just scribbles.   
Sad - I don't really... understand myself.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, huh...   
......   
   
Junpei Iori   
To tell ya the truth, there IS one thing that makes me feel alive...   
It's when I sort of, uh... get to play the hero, I guess?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - In the darkest hour, unknown to all but a few, the chosen ones stand against the forces of evil!   
Angry - Our hero, Junpei, fights to protect the world from these terrifying monsters!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Heheh... Well, you get the idea. That's when I feel most alive!   
   
Chidori   
......   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Um... This is the part where you're s'posed to laugh.   
   
Chidori   
So, do you fight all alone?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - H-Hey, I was just kiddin' around...   
   
Chidori   
You fight during a time that no one is aware of, right?   
That means no one knows what you've been doing.   
   
Chidori   
So, you're fighting even though you'll never get any recognition for anything.   
Happy - I'm impressed. I guess I misjudged you.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Uh... Really?   
Surprised - I didn't think you'd actually believe me...   
   
Chidori   
Can you tell me more?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Y'know, you're kinda the weird one here...   
Happy - Hmmm... I guess it's okay, but you're sworn to secrecy, got it?   
   
Chidori   
Mhm.   
   
Junpei Iori   
So, there's this special power called a "Persona," and that's what we use to defeat the monsters.   
But not everyone can use a Persona. That's what I meant by "the chosen ones."   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - My friends are fighting, too... And, not to brag, but we haven't lost a single fight since I joined!   
   
Chidori   
Happy - That sounds like a lot of fun.   
Happy - If you haven't lost a single fight, that must mean you're really strong.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Y-Yeah, sorta...   
Happy - I guess you could kinda say I'm the leader...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - I mean, without me, things would just fall apart.   
Happy - I gotta tell everyone what to do and stuff, y'know? It's a lot of work, bein' in charge.   
   
Chidori   
......   
   
Chidori   
Happy - Thank you, Junpei... I had a lot of fun today.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Y-You did?   
   
Chidori   
It's time for me to go. I'll see you tomorrow, right?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Heheh... See you tomorrow, huh?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - ...Yes!

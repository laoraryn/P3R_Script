'Sup! How's it goin'?
Happy - Wanna stop somewhere on the way home?

Minato Arisato - Selection
...Where?
I'm busy.

Junpei Iori
I dunno, maybe grab a bite to eat?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Oh, come on. It'll be quick.

Junpei Iori
Thaaat's right, you're new around here.
Happy - No worries, I'll show ya. It's just around the corner from here. Let's go!

Junpei Iori
Happy - This is Paulownia Mall.
Happy - Whenever I hang out with the guys from school, we end up comin' here.
There's a karaoke box, an arcade... Oh yeah, you can rent out CDs, too.
Happy - Then there's that club over there...
Sad - Not that I've ever gone in myself.

Junpei Iori
This place may not look like much, but I'm not complaining.
Let's check out the CDs first...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Oh whoa, that's new!
Happy - I gotta try this... Lemme show ya my mad crane game skills!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Argh, dammit!

Junpei Iori
Sad - Ohhh, come on, man...

Junpei Iori
Happy - I am not leaving empty-handed! Dude, help me look from the side.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Yeah, that's it! ...Or not.
Surprised - One more try... Just one more!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
......
I hung out with Junpei for a while
before heading back to the dorm...

I feel exhausted... Maybe it's because
I haven't gotten used to living here.

Just who was that old man from
the dream I had last night...?
And what was that "contract" all about?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's a message from Sanada.

Akihiko Sanada

MSG_001_0_0
It's important.

MSG_002_0_0
I want to touch base with everyone on where we're at.
Come to the lounge as soon as you get back.



===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Looks like they cleared out the chairman's room.

Akihiko Sanada
Well, no surprise there.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Aigis isn't here, either.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I just can't believe all this.

Ken Amada
Sad - It's in the papers, too.
Sad - "Kirijo Group CEO Dies Suddenly." They're blaming it on an illness, though.

Akihiko Sanada
Yeah, it's never the truth.

Ken Amada
Sad - Nope.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Kirijo-senpai's not here, huh?

Akihiko Sanada
She's an only child, so there's a lot to be settled, like the funeral and the family business.
She'll probably have her hands full for at least a week.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - That sounds rough. I hope she'll be okay.

Junpei Iori
Sad - So, what're we supposed to do now?
Sad - ......

Junpei Iori
Angry - What'll happen to Chidori?

Akihiko Sanada
No word yet. They're probably too busy to be thinking about that.
In fact, the entire Kirijo Group must be in a state of panic.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - I hope Aigis is okay.

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - Yeah...

Junpei Iori
Sad - Man, I wanna hear what they have to say, but they haven't made a peep.
Sad - Am I supposed to just wait for them to get their act together?

Akihiko Sanada
Mitsuru's meeting with the company execs. Might explain the delay.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Yeah...
Sad - But still, what are we going to do?
Sad - We have no idea how to get rid of the Dark Hour. We don't even know who to fight now.

Ken Amada
Sad - He kept saying stuff about "the Fall."
Sad - What would've happened if we were sacrificed?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I can't even imagine.
I don't want to think about it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Hm... So many unanswered questions.

Junpei Iori
Yeah, but standin' around here isn't gonna solve anything, right?

Akihiko Sanada
True.
But there is one thing we know.
Tartarus is still around, and Shadows are swarming the place.
We should train so we're ready for whatever we might be up against.

Ken Amada
Right.

Koromaru
Woof!

Akihiko Sanada
All right, that's it for tonight. Try to get some rest, even if you can't sleep.

Yukari Takeba
Okay.

Junpei Iori
Roger that.

Fuuka Yamagishi - MND_028_0_0

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, right. Yukari-chan.

Yukari Takeba
...Hm?
What's this? A disc?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Umm, there were traces of a video on the chairman's PC.
A lot was deleted, but I was able to restore some of it.
And, well, I think it's something you need to see.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Thanks, Fuuka. I'll be sure to watch this later.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Mhm. Just don't forget!

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
So it's just a normal DVD?
All right, let's see what's on here. Oh, there we go.

===============================================================================================

Eiichiro Takeba
I can only hope that this recording
reaches someone with a conscience...

Yukari Takeba
Isn't this... that video...?

Eiichiro Takeba
My employer has become
obsessed with a loathsome idea.

Eiichiro Takeba
This experiment should never
have been conceived...

Eiichiro Takeba
That's why I had to do
something to put a stop to it.

Eiichiro Takeba
However, in doing so, I released a number of Shadows
that are certain to torment future generations.

Eiichiro Takeba
But... I didn't have a choice... If I didn't do this...
it could have destroyed the entire world!

Eiichiro Takeba
Please, you need to listen very carefully...

Eiichiro Takeba
Whatever you do, it is imperative that you
do not hunt the Shadows that have dispersed.

Yukari Takeba
Huh? This part's...

Eiichiro Takeba
I wasn't able to do anything to stop this madness...

Eiichiro Takeba
He won't listen to a word I say... He's been
seduced by the devil's temptations...

Eiichiro Takeba
Those monsters will try to reunite and become one
again... If they succeed, then we're all doomed!

Eiichiro Takeba
I'll say it once more... Do not go after
the Shadows that were released!

Yukari Takeba
This is... the original video. The real one...
before Ikutsuki went and tampered with it...

Yukari Takeba
Dad was trying to put a stop to the experiment.

Eiichiro Takeba
There's not much hope for me now.

Eiichiro Takeba
I have just one request...

Eiichiro Takeba
Whoever finds this... please...
give my daughter Yukari this message...

Eiichiro Takeba
I know I promised I'd be home soon...
and I'm sorry to break that promise...

Eiichiro Takeba
But I want you to know... as your father, I was
never happier in my life than when I was with you.

Yukari Takeba
This really is... my dad...

Eiichiro Takeba
I love you, Yukari. Please...
Take care of yourself.

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Dad!?
Surprised - Dad!

Yukari Takeba
Crying - *sob*

Yukari Takeba
Crying - I know one thing for sure now.
Crying - I was right to believe in you.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I'm... doing okay.
Happy - It took a while, but I finally got your message.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The resolution in Yukari's heart has awakened a new Persona...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari's Persona, **Io**, has given rise to **Isis**!

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I'll fight for what I believe in.
Happy - That's what you would've wanted. Right, Dad?

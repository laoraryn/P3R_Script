Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I'm drenched from the rain.
My whole body is shivering...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Oh, didn't quite make it, huh?

Fuuka Yamagishi
According to the news, a typhoon just hit.
Apparently, it's the biggest one on record. It's moving slowly too, so it'll be gloomy for a while...

Junpei Iori
Sad - Yeah, thanks to that, the school festival got canned.
Sad - Welp, less work for us in the end, I guess.
Sad - Still sucks that we'll be stuck indoors for vacation though...
So, what'cha gonna do over break?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I made plans.
Nothing special.
I forgot we had one.

Junpei Iori
Oh, yeah? You always seem to keep busy, huh...

Junpei Iori
Happy - I always did picture you as a guy with too much free time.

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - Seriously? Dude, you're killin' me here...

Junpei Iori
Happy - What about you, Fuuka?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Me? The only thing I plan to do is go to the movies...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Ooh, a movie? Do you have a date?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - I-It's not like that.
I'm going with Natsuki-chan. We actually talk about movies all the time...
But with this typhoon, I don't know if we'll make it...

Junpei Iori
Happy - How 'bout you, Yuka-tan? Still gonna have practice?

Yukari Takeba
Hm? I dunno.
The archery range is outside, so it's most likely canceled until the storm blows over.

Akihiko Sanada
Same here. This stupid typhoon is gonna mess up my training.

Junpei Iori
Happy - You gotta be booked, right, Kirijo-senpai?

Mitsuru Kirijo
...I'm not sure yet.
Why are you so curious about our business, Iori?

Junpei Iori
Very happy* - Oh, me? Well, I'd be happy to tell you about my plans...

Aigis
I suspect that you will be visiting Chidori-san.
Although she is in stable condition now, we still can't release her.

Junpei Iori
Very happy* - Man, Ai-chan, you must be psychic.
Happy - And ya know what? She even told me she wants me to come!

Junpei Iori
Very happy* - ...Oh man, I can't believe she said that!
Happy - So, I figured I should probably check up on her. Y'know, with the storm and all.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Mhm...

Akihiko Sanada
...What's with him? Why's he all excited?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Exasperated* - Um... Well...

Akihiko Sanada
You don't know either, huh...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Um... Oh! Amada-kun, what are your plans during the break?

Ken Amada
Oh, I'm not really doing anything in particular...

Junpei Iori
Come on, you gotta be doing something.

Ken Amada
Oh, I'll probably go visit the shrine.

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - Dude, you're a kid, not an old man.

Ken Amada
I always go to pray, though.
I guess you could say I have a wish I want granted...

Shinjiro Aragaki
......

Ken Amada
Anyway, I'm going back to my room. I've got a lot of homework to do.

Junpei Iori
Oh, okay. Just holler if you get stuck, yeah?

Akihiko Sanada
......

Shinjiro Aragaki
Sad - ......

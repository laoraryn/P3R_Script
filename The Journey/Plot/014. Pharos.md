Mysterious Boy
Hi, how've you been?

Mysterious Boy
Happy - Hehe...

Minato Arisato - Selection
1. And you are...?
2. How'd you get in here?

===1===

Mysterious Boy
Happy - We've met before.

===2===

Mysterious Boy
Happy - I'm always by your side...

=======

Mysterious Boy
Soon, the end will come.
I remembered, so I thought I should tell you.

Minato Arisato - Selection
1. The end?
2. I don't care.

===1===

Mysterious Boy
It's the end of everything.
Happy - ...But to be honest, I don't really know much about it.

===2===

Mysterious Boy
Really...? Well, if you say so.
Happy - To be honest, I don't have much to tell you anyway.

=======

Mysterious Boy
More importantly, it looks like you've awakened to your power.
And what an unusual power it is.
Happy - A power that takes many forms, yet is bound by none...
Happy - It might even prove to be your salvation, depending on where you end up.

Mysterious Boy
Do you remember when we first met?
Happy - I expect you to honor your commitment.

Mysterious Boy
I'm always watching you... even if you forget about me.
Happy - Okay then, see you later.

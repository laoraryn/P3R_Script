Pharos   
Good evening.   
   
Pharos   
Things are really starting to liven up around here.   
Happy - So, how are you getting along with everyone?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Not bad.   
Who cares about them?   
   
Pharos   
Happy - Oh, that's good to hear.   
   
Pharos   
It's important though. You're putting your lives into each other's hands.   
   
Pharos   
...Just to remind you, the next full moon will be in one week.   
Are you ready?   
   
Pharos   
I actually haven't been too worried about you lately.   
But you should still be careful.   
   
Pharos   
I'll see you again.

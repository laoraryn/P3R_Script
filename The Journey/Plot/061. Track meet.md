Track Team Advisor
Hey, Arisato. Do you have a minute?

Track Team Advisor
It's about the track team. Since you just transferred, you probably haven't heard about the Myouou Cup, right?
Well, lemme tell ya. On August 2nd, there's a major competition for track and field.

Track Team Advisor
There's this guy named Hayase—total speed demon. We can't let him trounce us this year!
I've got high hopes for you, so get ready to train hard!

Track Team Advisor
I'm gonna need you to show up from July 27th to August 1st. Don't go skippin' school now.
I've got a special training regimen in mind for you. Hayase won't stand a chance!
The competition's on August 2nd! Let's do this thing!

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Gekkoukan High School, practice field...
We trained all day to prepare for
the competition on August 2nd.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Hey! No slackin', put your heart into it!
You'll never beat Hayase with that attitude!

Yuko Nishiwaki
You're almost there! Keep up the pace!
This is our year! Hayase's got nothing on us!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Wow, Arisato-kun! That was a great lap!
Happy - Keep it up! You might be able to win the whole thing!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Three days left until the competition...

Yuko Nishiwaki
Stay focused, everyone!
Tomorrow's the big day!
Surprised - Whoa, you're doing great, Arisato-kun!
Happy - That's the fastest time on the team! Good luck tomorrow—you got this!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
My body feels light...
But my time wasn't that good.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I beat my record!
I'm second on the team.
Just one person left...
The tournament is the
day after tomorrow...

Representative
Attention!
The time is upon us to demonstrate outstanding sportsmanship! May the best runner win!

Kazushi Miyamoto
Hey, you're almost up, Arisato!

Yuko Nishiwaki
How are you feeling? Think you got this?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Definitely.
I'm a little nervous.
Don't forget to cheer for me.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Happy - Ooh, that's what I like to hear!
Since this is your first time, let me give you some advice.
Angry - All you have to do is give it your all!
Angry - Remember, mind over matter!
Angry - And the biggest enemy out there... is yourself!

Kazushi Miyamoto
Happy - Yeah, I thought you might be.
Happy - But don't worry, man! Everyone's like that in the beginning.
Well, this is your first time, so let me give you some advice.
Angry - All you have to do is give it your all!
Angry - Remember, mind over matter!
Angry - And the biggest enemy out there... is yourself!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - You got it! Leave the cheering to me!
Happy - Oh yeah... Here, take this, Arisato-kun.
Happy - It should help get you energized for the race.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Happy - Since this is your first big event, let me give you some advice.
Angry - All you have to do is give it your all!
Angry - Remember, mind over matter!
Angry - And the biggest enemy out there... is yourself!

Kazushi Miyamoto
Angry - Alright, dude!
Angry - Go show 'em what you're made of!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Woooooo! Keep it up, Arisato-kun!

Kazushi Miyamoto
Happy - Whoa! Holy crap, he's fast! Go, go, goooooo!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - That was amazing, Arisato-kun! I can't believe it's your first time competing!
Happy - On top of that, this was your fastest time yet!

Kazushi Miyamoto
Happy - Man, you killed it!
Happy - Looks like all your hard work paid off.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - Still a bummer, though...
Sad - Even with your incredible performance, that guy still won.

Kazushi Miyamoto
You mean Hayase, right? They say he blows everyone out of the water in every competition.
I thought people were exaggerating, but geez, he's insane!
Could sure use someone like him on our team...
Angry - Arghhh, dammit!
Angry - We'll get 'em next time for sure!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Surprised - Hey, wait! Isn't that him?

Competitor Named Hayase
Yo.
You were pretty fast.

Minato Arisato - Selection
I've been training.
Not fast enough.

Competitor Named Hayase
Must've been some training...

Competitor Named Hayase
Happy - Plenty enough to make me sweat a bit.

Competitor Named Hayase
Hey, I know this is weird all of a sudden...
But would you want to hang out sometime?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure, I don't mind.
Why?

Competitor Named Hayase
Happy - Cool, sounds good.
You still need to work on your technique, but I feel like you've got potential.
Maybe you could help push me to test my limits.

Competitor Named Hayase
You still need to work on your technique, but I feel like you've got potential.
Maybe you could help push me to test my limits.
That's why.

Competitor Named Hayase
I usually grab a bite to eat at the **strip mall** in Iwatodai **after school**...

Competitor Named Hayase
Stop by sometime if you feel like it.
Happy - The name's Mamoru Hayase.

Mamoru Hayase
Well... I'll see you around.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Wow, Arisato-kun! Hayase must really see you as a worthy rival!

Kazushi Miyamoto
Angry - Hmph!
Angry - If you see him again, tell him this...
Angry - Next time, I'll kick your ass!
You got that?

Yuko Nishiwaki
Calm down, Kaz.
By the way, wasn't that Niimura guy from Third High supposed to be pretty good too? He never showed.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Yeah, I was talking to some of the guys from his school. Apparently they couldn't get a hold of him.
They even went out to check his house, but he wasn't there.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Surprised - So he's gone missing!? Did he run away from home? Maybe he was afraid of going up against Hayase...
Or, wait... Do you think it's because of that Apathy Syndrome thing...?

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - No idea... Hope he shows up again soon in one piece.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - Yeah...
Happy - Anyway, now's not the time to get down in the dumps. Our school did great today, after all!
Happy - Good job out there, Arisato-kun!

Kazushi Miyamoto
Happy - Alright. Let's get outta here.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I decided to head back with my teammates.

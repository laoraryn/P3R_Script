Mr. Ekoda
All right, time for class...
I know you've been busy lately, but you all remembered to do your homework, right?
Just because you're not taking a humanities class next year doesn't mean you can blow off classic lit.
Hey... Are you all listening to me?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - ......

Natsuki Moriyama
What's wrong, Fuuka? You look kinda down.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Huh...?

Natsuki Moriyama
Talk to me. What's bothering you?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - It's just... Aragaki-senpai...

Natsuki Moriyama
Sad - Oh... Yeah, it's pretty shocking...
Sad - I'd never seen him in school, but he'd always be hanging around town...

Natsuki Moriyama
Sad - And now, he's just... gone. It's hard to put it into words.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - I took it for granted that everyone would always be around, that nothing would ever change...
Sad - But, some things you can never get back... I didn't consider how easily it could happen.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Once I realized that, I started thinking about my parents.
Sad - I've sort of been avoiding the question, but... is it okay for me to leave things with them like this?

Natsuki Moriyama
Parents, huh...? Yeah, that's a tough one.
But, I think you'll work it out, Fuuka.

Mr. Ekoda
Moriyama, what are you waiting for? Come on up.

Natsuki Moriyama
Yeah, yeah.

Mr. Ekoda
Would it kill you to give your classmates a proper goodbye?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Huh? What's going on?

Natsuki Moriyama
Uhhh, hi, everyone. I know I haven't been here that long, but I feel like I've made some good friends.
I'll remember each and every one of you after I transfer. Thank you all... How's that?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Huh...? Wait, transfer...?

Fuuka Yamagishi
[cut 6 4 0]

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - WHAT!?

===============================================================================================

Natsuki Moriyama
You're a weird one, y'know that?
The biggest bitch in school is leaving, and you're gonna miss her?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - You're transferring... and you didn't say anything...?

Natsuki Moriyama
It's not like it would've made a difference. Why make us both depressed?

Natsuki Moriyama
Sad - But yeah, my dad suddenly collapsed...
Sad - And they say it'll take a while for him to recover, because of some complications...
Sad - We don't really have that much money, so we can't afford to stay in this area.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - ......

Natsuki Moriyama
Y'know, now that I think about it, you're the only one who bothered being friends with a weirdo like me.
But like I said before... we're both in the same boat.
My parents act like I don't even exist. I hate living with them.
That's why I was so jealous when you moved into the dorm.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Natsuki-chan...

Natsuki Moriyama
You know, you've really changed, Fuuka. You're a lot more cheerful now.
But why'd you move when your house is, like, right here?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Huh? Well, um...

Natsuki Moriyama
If you don't wanna say, that's okay. I'm sure you've got your reasons.

Natsuki Moriyama
But, if it's something that you and your parents can work out, then do it while you have a chance.
It'll be a while before my dad's in any condition for us to have a heart-to-heart.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - ......

Natsuki Moriyama
Very happy* - Haha, what am I doing? This isn't what I wanted to talk about.

Natsuki Moriyama
Y'know, Fuuka... I used to think every day was just the same depressing routine.
And, I'm only saying this 'cause it's you, but...
You don't really get many second chances in life.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Natsuki-chan...?

Natsuki Moriyama
I guess this is the last time I'll see this view...

Natsuki Moriyama
I won't be in school next week 'cause I'll be packing, so... I guess this is goodbye.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - No!

Natsuki Moriyama
Haha, don't you dare come see me off! I wanna say goodbye on my own terms.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - ......

Natsuki Moriyama
C'mon, don't give me that look.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - But... you're leaving so suddenly...

Natsuki Moriyama
Hey, I'm not all broken up about this, just so you know. I've changed a lot since I met you.
I'm gonna try and figure out what I really wanna do with my life.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I know you can do it, Natsuki-chan.

Natsuki Moriyama
Very happy* - Haha, well now I really feel like I gotta do it. No pressure, right?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - No...

Natsuki Moriyama
I got one last thing I wanna say before I go.

Natsuki Moriyama
If you just accept the way things are, then you'll never move forward... just like me.

Fuuka Yamagishi
......

Natsuki Moriyama
So, I hope you can figure out what you want, too.

Fuuka Yamagishi
What I want...
I...
......

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - I used to try and please everyone just to fit in.
Sad - I was afraid of not being liked, so I always went along with the people around me.
Sad - But, I never really thought about what I wanted.

Natsuki Moriyama
Very happy* - Hahaha, that's so you. Well, if they don't like you for who you are, I say screw 'em.
But... I like you, Fuuka, even if you hate yourself.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Natsuki-chan...

Natsuki Moriyama
Well... I better get going.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - ......

Fuuka Yamagishi
Ah...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Huh? Natsuki-chan!?

Text Message
"Here..."
"Even if we're apart, we're still connected. So, we can always talk, right?"
"Thanks for being my friend. I'm kinda tearing up now."

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Natsuki-chan...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - "Even if we're apart, we're still connected."
Sad - ......

Fuuka Yamagishi
I get it now, Natsuki-chan.
I'd always assumed my powers were a reflection of my faults...
I was always worried about how other people see me, and that's why my powers let me "see" others...

Fuuka Yamagishi
But, I guess there is something I want after all...
Seeing everyone getting along and working together makes me so happy.
So, I want us to treasure this forever.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I have the power to connect people, even when they're apart...
My Persona has given me this amazing gift—the friendship I've always wanted.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The resolution in Fuuka's heart has awakened a new Persona...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Fuuka's Persona, **Lucia**, has given rise to **Juno**!

Yukari Takeba
There you are.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Oh... What are you all doing here?

Aigis
It is unusual to find you up on the rooftop.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Well, we didn't see you around, so we weren't sure if you were alright...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I think I've figured it out.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Okay...?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I've made up my mind. I'm going to do everything I can with the power I've been given.
Happy - This is what I've decided I want to do.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Um... Sure?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Hehe, sorry. I guess that was out of nowhere, wasn't it?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Uh... You sure you're alright?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Hehe.

Ms. Toriumi
All right, everyone, settle down!
So, there won't be any more classes this afternoon...

Ms. Toriumi
But that doesn't mean you're free to goof around!
It's time to work together and put away the culture festival displays and decorations.

Ms. Toriumi
I'll assign you into three groups for the cleanup.
The first group will go to the science lab. Your leader will be...

Internal MES - MND_003_0_0
Afternoon classes were canceled so we
could clean up the culture festival displays...

===============================================================================================

Kenji Tomochika
Okay, let's hurry up and get this over with.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Roger that.

Yukari Takeba
Got it.

Kenji Tomochika
Hm, I guess this was the photography club's display.

Kenji Tomochika
Look, Arisato. They got a pretty good picture of you.
Whoa... The guy who took first looks pretty suntanned.

Kazushi Miyamoto
That's Hayase. He's crazy fast.
'Course, it's only a matter of time until I take him down!

Kenji Tomochika
Haha, you've already got him beat in the sweaty department. I swear, I've never seen you without your gym clothes.
Then again, maybe you're the smart one here... Just walking around is enough to work up a sweat these days.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Hey, you guys can jabber all you want, but at least keep things moving. At this rate, we'll be here all day.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Surprised - Er— Sorry, Takeba! My bad...

Kenji Tomochika
Hey... What's got you all worked up?

Kazushi Miyamoto
Nothing, geez!

Junpei Iori
Yo, I brought the tools and stuff. The nail puller, tape, and, uh... What else was it?

Aigis
If you require a drill, I have one installed.

Kenji Tomochika
Cool. Thanks, guys!
Wait, hang on... Where's the bubble wrap, Iori?

Junpei Iori
Bubble wrap...? Oh right, we gotta pack stuff up...
Uhhh...
Good call, man! You should go get it. You know where they keep that stuff, right?

Kenji Tomochika
Sad - Well, yeah, but... You're the one who forgot to grab it.

Junpei Iori
Oh? Are you sure you don't wanna go?
Happy - That place is like a paradise, y'know! Some fine chicas there who'd be just your type...

Kenji Tomochika
Surprised - Uh, what? No way, are you serious? Give me the details, man!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Ahem! I believe I asked you all to hurry it up so we could go home!

Junpei Iori
Sad - Oh, uh... Sorry, Yuka-tan...
Sad - Man, talk about an Ace Directive.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - I heard that.
Angry - Geez, how stupid can you be?

Kenji Tomochika
Junpei? More like Stupei.

Junpei Iori
Sad - I'm getting déjà vu...
Sad - Fine... I'll go to the supply room later.

Kenji Tomochika
Still, it's a real shame the culture festival fell through.
There were so many cool events I was looking forward to, like the stand-up comedy duos...
They said it was gonna be open mic, so I was planning on trying it out.

Junpei Iori
Whoa, really? With who?

Kenji Tomochika
You.

Junpei Iori
Hm...
Surprised - Wait, me!? Were you gonna just push me on stage without even saying anything!?

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - I'm just messin' with ya. It was actually Miyamoto.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Surprised - Who, me?
Hell no.

Kenji Tomochika
Exasperated* - Just another joke... Chill out, guys.
I'll do it with Arisato, then.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Bring it on.
No way.

Kenji Tomochika
Exasperated* - Whaaat, you too? This could've been our ticket to stardom...
Sad - You all suck...

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - Now that's the spirit! Why don't we show these guys what we've got?

Kenji Tomochika
Ahem...
Happy - Hello out there, everyone! We're the famous comedy duo, Kenji Tomochika!

Minato Arisato - Selection
Where's my name!?
Nice to meet you all!
......

Kenji Tomochika
Ooh, nice and snappy. You're pretty good.
Happy - Man, I can't wait for the culture festival. It's gonna be awesome, huh?

Kenji Tomochika
Surprised - Oh, come on! I just gave you the perfect setup for a comeback!
Surprised - You coulda said something like, "Pretty lonely duo!" Or "I'm here too, y'know!"
Happy - Anyway, I sure can't wait for the culture festival. It's gonna be awesome, huh?

Kenji Tomochika
Surprised - Hey, don't you have something to say? Didn't you notice I left you out...?
Surprised - You coulda said something like, "Pretty lonely duo!" Or "I'm here too, y'know!"
Happy - Anyway, I sure can't wait for the culture festival. It's gonna be awesome, huh?

Minato Arisato - Selection
It's already over, dummy!
Yeah, I can't wait!
......

Kenji Tomochika
Sad - What, you giving up already? All you gotta do is sleep like 360 more times, and bam. Culture festival.
Happy - You know what they say... Early to bed, early to rise—


Minato Arisato - Selection
Makes ya healthy, or is it lies?
......

Kenji Tomochika
Sad - There ya go! We got a top-quality one this time. Kinda depressing, though.
Happy - Hey, speaking of jokes, here's a good one. What do you do when your key isn't working?

Kenji Tomochika

Kenji Tomochika
Exasperated* - Why are you looking at me like that? C'mon, gimme a punchline!
Happy - Hey, speaking of jokes, here's a good one. What do you do when your key isn't working?

Kenji Tomochika

Minato Arisato - Selection
Key-p trying!
Throw it away.
......

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - That's the lamest joke I've heard in years!
Happy - Guess that's the best Gekkoukan has to offer.

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - What? No! It's probably the key to something else!
Happy - Don't you wanna see what it unlocks? Never gonna happen if you throw it away.
Happy - Wait a sec, this isn't even a joke anymore!
Happy - You'll have to hand in your Gekkoukan ID if you don't Geck Yo act together! Yeah... I apologize for that one.

Kenji Tomochika

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - Oh no, no one's answering... If the key's not working, I can't get into my house... It's so cold...
Sad - Don't leave me hangin', man! What happened to the bit!?

Kenji Tomochika
Surprised - Dude, it's over. It's been over! We missed it!
Happy - Yeesh, I can't count on you for anything. You're not doing this on purpose, are you?
Happy - Sorry, guys, he's a little slow. Have some patience whenever you talk with him, alright?
Happy - I know he walks around with his hands in his pockets, but don't worry! He's not up to anything!
Happy - You have your reasons, right?

Kenji Tomochika
Surprised - Please, say something! I can't handle the silent treatment!
Happy - Well, everyone, he may not talk much, but he's a good guy once you get to know him.
Happy - I know he walks around with his hands in his pockets, but don't worry! He's not up to anything!
Happy - You have your reasons, right?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I do, but it's a secret.
I love pockets!
Not really.

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - You make it sound so mysterious, but I bet you've just been stuffing bread pieces from lunch in there.
Happy - The moment you take your hands out, crumbs'll fly everywhere and attract little birds! What are you, a fairytale princess?

Kenji Tomochika
Surprised - Everyone loves pockets! That doesn't make you special, man!

Kenji Tomochika
Surprised - You're not even trying!
Happy - You're like a pitcher ignoring the catcher's signals. I bet you'd nail the batter with a fastball and not even be sorry.

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - ......
Happy - Not bad, considering we didn't rehearse this at all.
Happy - Man... We would've been great...

Yukari Takeba
All right, break it up, you guys. Seriously, I take my eyes off you for one second...

Kenji Tomochika
Speaking of things that would've been great... You missed out on your chance to be a maid, Takeba-san!

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Huh!?
Oh... So word got out about that. I, for one, am fine with missing that opportunity...

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - Bet a lotta guys were real disappointed... Ain't that right, Miyamoto?

Kazushi Miyamoto
Surprised - Huh? Uh, how should I know?
Wait, why are they disappointed? The maids are there to help with the café, right?

Kenji Tomochika

Junpei Iori
Happy - Ah, such a pure soul...

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - Well, it's kinda something that guys fantasize about... Mainly Junpei.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Oh...

Junpei Iori
What are you lookin' at me for? What did I do?

Aigis
Sad - Junpei-san...

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Aw, come on! You too, Ai-chan!?

Female Student's Voice
Excuse me! Is Takeba-san here?

Yukari Takeba
Oh, Nishiwaki-san. What's up?

Yuko Nishiwaki
You know those tents out on the field? Is it cool if we put them away in the archery club room?

Yukari Takeba
Oh, yeah, that's fine... Actually, don't worry about it. The archery team can take care of it later.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Please, it's no biggie. Our class is in charge of cleaning up the grounds anyway.
We'll go ahead and take care of it. Thanks!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Surprised - Oh!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - Arisato-kun! Are you feeling better? You had a fever, right?
Sad - I heard you were stuck in bed the whole break... You sure you're okay?

Kazushi Miyamoto
Just look at him. He's fine.

Yuko Nishiwaki
I guess you have a point... Well, I'm happy to see that.
Happy - Wait, you're here too, Kaz? Better not be slacking off—an ox like you has gotta pull his weight!

Kazushi Miyamoto
Shut up! Isn't it time you got back to the grounds?

Yuko Nishiwaki
Hey, I haven't seen him in a while, so I think we deserve some time together.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Right?

Yukari Takeba
Angry - You... deserve some time together?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Huh? Dude... Hey, Minato!

Chihiro Fushimi
Surprised - S-Sorry... E-Excuse me!
Surprised - Um... If you happen to have any duct tape left... m-may I borrow some...?

Chihiro Fushimi
Oh, Arisato-san! I'm so glad you're here...
I'm actually in charge of the classroom next door, and we've run out of tape...
I was nervous coming over here, since the upperclassmen were in charge of this room...
Happy - But I feel a lot better seeing you here, Arisato-san.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Angry - ......

Yukari Takeba
Angry - ......

Chihiro Fushimi
Um... I saw Kirijo-senpai a moment ago, and she said...
You were, um... bedridden with a cold? You shouldn't overstrain yourself.
If you're not feeling well, perhaps you should take some time off from your student council duties.
It'll be a little lonely, no longer being able to walk home together, but...

Junpei Iori
Surprised - ...!

Kazushi Miyamoto
Surprised - ...!

Kenji Tomochika
Surprised - ...!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Angry - Huh? Wait, what do you mean by...?

Yukari Takeba
Angry - What exactly is your—


Junpei Iori
Sad - Uhhh... Whoa, that display over there looks like it could fall over any moment now!
Sad - Someone's gonna get hurt if we don't fix it right now. Like, RIGHT now.
Sad - Yuka-tan, c'mon and gimme a hand. Keep it steady on one side so I can take it down.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - ...Huh!? Oh, uh, yeah. Gotcha.

Yuko Nishiwaki
So, uhh... What were we talking about again?

Kazushi Miyamoto
Surprised - Uh... Um... O-Oh yeah! Man, I almost forgot!
Surprised - There's something important the team needs to know! Hey, you're the manager—can you go tell 'em for me?

Yuko Nishiwaki
Surprised - Huh?

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - Uh, so I want you to tell them... for our next practice, um...
Surprised - There are no towels allowed!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Huh? No towels? Wouldn't that get in the way of practice? And why is this coming up now?

Kazushi Miyamoto
Just go tell them! It's a... special training technique!
C'mon, hop to it!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Fine, whatever...

Kenji Tomochika
Sad - Uhhh... Yeah, sorry. Looks like we're all out of duct tape here.
Sad - I guess you'd have to go to another classroom for that... I mean, you guys need it now, right?

Chihiro Fushimi
Surprised - O-Oh, I see! Sorry for interrupting!
Well then, if you'll excuse me...

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - Okay. Dude...

Kenji Tomochika
Sad - I guess it's a good thing the culture festival was canceled...
Sad - You would've gotten mauled no matter who you picked to go with.

Aigis
...?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We finished our cleaning
with no further issues...

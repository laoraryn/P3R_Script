Do you recall fighting that Shadow here on the rooftop a little while back?   
Well, while cleaning up the aftermath, I happened upon some planters and gardening tools.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - And I couldn't help myself from setting up our own little garden!   
Happy - So what do you think? Not too shabby, eh?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Looks pretty good.   
You like gardening?   
Why am I here?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - Ah, you have impeccable taste. I'm glad my efforts didn't go unappreciated.   
Happy - Unfortunately, I can feel my back giving out after all that hard work... Do you happen to know a good chiropractor?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Oh, I wouldn't say it's a hobby of mine, really. The idea just popped into my head.   
I mean, look at all this space we have here. It'd be a shame not to put it to use.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Surprised - Oh? Are you not interested in this sort of thing?   
Happy - Tending to plants can help calm the mind... or so they say. I don't have much gardening experience myself.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
But I digress. There is, in fact, a reason I brought you here.   
I'd like you to use these planters however you see fit.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Although I did set them up, I'm afraid that I won't be able to tend to a garden as often as I'd like.   
I did mention it to Kirijo-kun, but it didn't catch on, I suppose, due to her upbringing.   
Besides, you're able to cook meals at the dorm, correct?   
Happy - Well, now you can grow your own vegetables for healthy eating!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sounds interesting.   
Sounds like a lot of work.   
I don't know how.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - I'm glad you think so. It would mean a lot to me if you made good use of the planters.   
Happy - Once you get started, you'll find there's a lot that can be done. Of course, you're free to do whatever you want.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Oh, I won't force you to work on this if you absolutely don't want to.   
I'm just giving you the option to do so. Come plant something whenever you feel like it.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Oh, no need to worry your little head.   
Just plant a couple and let nature take its course.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Here are some seedlings. Go ahead and plant them if you'd like.   
You should be able to purchase other types of seedlings around the city. Feel free to experiment.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Well, that's everything. And now...   
Happy - It's time to raise the roof and elevate this garden to new heights! And to top it off...   
Happy - Eat your veggies, peas!

A number of days after planting a seedling, certain plants will be ready for harvest.

I hear you're the one taking care of it, Arisato.   
Happy - Looks like it's shaping up quite nicely. The chairman was right to put you in charge.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I've been told it was left in your care, Arisato.   
I know it sounds like a lot of work, but it might be nice to try growing a thing or two.

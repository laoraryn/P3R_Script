Akihiko Sanada
Lounging about as usual, huh?

Shinjiro Aragaki
Hm?
You. What do you want?
If you're gonna ask me to go back, the answer's still no.

Akihiko Sanada
That's not why I'm here.
I was just making sure you were still around.

Shinjiro Aragaki
That so?

Akihiko Sanada
We've known each other a long time.
It's been almost fourteen years since we met at the orphanage.
Happy - You, me, and Miki. We used to run around here until the sun went down.
Happy - Back then, it seemed like we had all the time in the world.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Hah. You haven't changed one bit.

Shinjiro Aragaki
If you wanna get all sappy, go do it with your other pals.

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - What was that!?

Shinjiro Aragaki
It's rare for you to think about the past. Usually, you just charge ahead like a damn fool.

Shinjiro Aragaki
You've never been good at hiding shit.

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - ......
Sad - Everyone thinks about the past. Even me.
Sad - ......
Anyway, we finally know how to get rid of Tartarus and the Dark Hour.

Shinjiro Aragaki
No shit?

Akihiko Sanada
Yeah.

Akihiko Sanada
The thing is, all I've cared about until now is getting stronger. Everything else came second.
But yesterday, someone made me question my reason for fighting.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Your reason for fighting, huh.
It's different for everyone. But if you don't have a good one, you can always quit.
That's what I did.

Akihiko Sanada
...I'm not like you.
Happy - Man, I can't believe I'm the one getting lectured here.

Shinjiro Aragaki
......

Akihiko Sanada
Well, see you around.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Hmph. You really haven't changed at all.

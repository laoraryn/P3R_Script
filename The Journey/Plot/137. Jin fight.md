Jin
So, ya came after all...

Akihiko Sanada
Surprised - You...!?
Angry - Where's your partner?

Jin
Takaya went on ahead of me.
He's destined for far greater heights than someone like myself.
So, if you guys are here, that means you're serious about fighting Nyx.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - How do you know about Nyx?

Jin
Sad - I just pieced together what information Ikutsuki left behind.
Sad - 'Course, a good chunk of it was just delusional nonsense. He was a real nut job.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - You knew Ikutsuki!?

Jin
Oh yeah, so he was your boss, huh? It was a big surprise findin' that out.
That said, we only really knew his name...
Angry - He was just one of the researchers who created us.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - He... created you!?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Who exactly are you!?

Jin
Heh, what's the point in telling you? It'll all be over soon...

Mitsuru Kirijo
We don't have time for this. Step aside.

Jin
Angry - Sorry, no can do.
There's no way Nyx could be stopped by the likes of you.
But I ain't about to let you get in Takaya's way.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Do you even understand what you're saying!?
Angry - If we don't stop Nyx, all life will be destroyed!

Jin
Angry - That's the point.
Angry - We ain't gonna live much longer either way... So we gotta see it through to the end.
Angry - This is Takaya's wish... So I'm not backin' down.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - But...

Jin
Alright... I think that's enough talkin'.
Time to get serious... Let's do this.

===============================================================================================

Jin
Sad - Ugh... I failed... Ngh...

Jin
Angry - What're you waitin' for? Finish me off!
Angry - I would do anything for Takaya.

Akihiko Sanada
Why are you so devoted to him?

Jin
Sad - Heh... You wouldn't understand...
Sad - Takaya showed me the light when I was in the darkness...

Jin
I forget how many years it's been...
It was before I knew about the Dark Hour, or havin' the potential, or any of that...
The Kirijo Group rounded up orphans from all over, and tried to awaken Personas in them.
Their goal was to investigate Tartarus.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - What?

Jin
Sad - But, when a Persona doesn't emerge naturally, it's difficult to control.
Sad - So, the kids had to take these experimental drugs so their Personas wouldn't kill them.
Sad - Only three kids out of the original hundred survived, and after six months, the experiment was canceled.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - No... So, those three survivors were...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - So you've all suffered at the hands of the Kirijo Group as well...

Jin
Sad - Takaya saved me from it all... I'll never forget what he told me.
Sad - "Don't be bound by the past, and don't look to the future. Simply live in the moment."
Sad - Honestly, I don't even give a damn about Kirijo anymore.
Sad - But... I'm gonna... fulfill... Takaya's wish... no matter what...!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - But you...

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - Tch, we overstayed our welcome!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - We're running out of time! Everyone, head up!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - But... what about him?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Come with us.
......

Jin
Angry - I don't need your pity, dumbass!

Jin
Happy - Heh, that's right. I don't need your pity.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - ......

Ken Amada
Sad - ......

Koromaru
Sad - *whine*

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - B-But...

Akihiko Sanada
No hesitation. If we don't defeat Nyx, then this was all for nothing.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Got it...

Junpei Iori
Angry - Dammit...

Aigis
......

Akihiko Sanada
Let's go, Aigis.

Jin
Happy - Look at these ugly clowns, crawlin' up in droves...
Happy - Heh... You're not eatin' me... I ain't goin' out on your terms...

Jin
Angry - I believe in you, Takaya... Fulfill our wish...
Angry - I will hold on to the freedom you gave me to the very end...!

Junpei Iori
Angry - Hey... You hear that?
Angry - Don't tell me he...!

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - Don't look back!

Mitsuru Kirijo
......
Let's go.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - ......

Shuji Ikutsuki   
Hello there.   
So, how's he doing?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
He went to bed a little while ago. He's currently fast asleep.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Mr. Chairman, do you think he's...?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Well, let's wait and see for now.   
The Dark Hour is approaching.

Hmm... He's still sleeping.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
The Dark Hour occurs every day at 12 midnight. You could say it's the "hidden" hour.   
During this time, an ordinary person transmogrifies into a coffin, and is oblivious to all that occurs.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Then, he must be...   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
As you can see, he's retained his human form.   
He may be asleep, but he's definitely experiencing the Dark Hour.   
The only question that remains is whether or not he has the potential.   
Though come to think of it, he must... If he didn't, they would've preyed on him by now.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Scary...   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
In any case, we should continue to monitor him for a few more days.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yes, sir.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - I feel kinda bad, though, spying on him like this...

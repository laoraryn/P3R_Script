Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Yes? Who is it?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Um, it's me.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Huh? Oh, come in.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You don't stop by very often, Senpai.   
Is something wrong?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
No, not particularly. Is this a bad time?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Awww, are you feeling lonely?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Hey, are you teasing me?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Nah, I'd never.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Haha, sure.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I wonder what this Nyx is like.   
Do you think it's inside Tartarus?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I have no idea.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, by the way, I've made my decision.   
I want to fight to the end. It's better than doing nothing.   
Happy - That's why you're here, right, Senpai?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - You got me.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Yeah, you're pretty easy to read.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I've made my decision as well.   
The Kirijo Group is slowly regaining its footing.   
After I graduate, the plan is for me to eventually take over as leader.   
Turning back was never really an option for me.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - But what if you die?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If we can defeat Nyx and I die in the process, then the company will continue on without me.   
And I'm confident they'd carry on my wishes.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - But from what we've heard, Nyx can't be defeated.   
Sad - Though I kinda wonder about that.   
We've got someone on our team who seems pretty unkillable, too.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That's true.   
And he's an exceptional Persona-user, even if Death was empowering him from within.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - He's an interesting guy, huh?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
He certainly is.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You know, if things don't work out, I think I'll still be okay as long as I'm with everyone.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Honestly, I don't think it matters if we live or die.   
All that really matters is that we're proud of how we lived.   
And I know I'd be proud if we decided to fight Nyx.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Is this about honoring your father's legacy?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, that's part of it. But mostly, it's about me and how I feel.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - I understand.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Senpai, a while back, you asked me to face what comes next with you.   
Happy - You didn't forget, did you?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - I could never forget.   
We'll fight together, Yukari.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - ...Good.

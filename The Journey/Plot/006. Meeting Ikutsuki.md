The Iwatodai strip mall is bustling
with activity in the afternoon...

Yukari Takeba
Oh, he's back.

Sophisticated Gentleman
Happy - So, this is our new guest...

Sophisticated Gentleman
Happy - Good evening.
Happy - My name is Shuji Ikutsuki. I'm the chairman of the board for your school.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - "Ikutsuki"... Hard to say, isn't it?
That's why I don't like introducing myself. Even I get tongue-tied sometimes...
Happy - Please, have a seat.

Shuji Ikutsuki
I apologize for the confusion regarding your accommodations.
But it may take a bit longer before you receive the proper room assignment.
Happy - Is there anything you'd like to ask?

Minato Arisato - Selection
1. Why are you here?
2. Who else lives here?
3. The other night, I saw...
4. No, I'm good.

===1===

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - To welcome you, of course. You don't mind, do you?

Shuji Ikutsuki
Speaking of which... Takeba-kun, have you seen Kirijo-kun, by any chance?

Yukari Takeba
She's upstairs.

Shuji Ikutsuki
As diligent as always. But it couldn't hurt to come down and say hello...

Shuji Ikutsuki
Is there anything else?

===2===

Shuji Ikutsuki
There are only four students in this dorm.
You, Takeba-kun here, Kirijo-kun...
And a third-year named Akihiko Sanada-kun.
Happy - I hope you all get along.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Do you have another question?

===3===

Shuji Ikutsuki
Surprised - You saw... something strange? Like what?

Yukari Takeba
......

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - You were probably just tired. I wouldn't worry about it.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Something doesn't seem right...

Shuji Ikutsuki
Any other questions?

===4===

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Excellent. Here's to a wonderful school year.
Now, if you'll excuse me...

=======

Shuji Ikutsuki
I'm sure you're worn out from all these formalities. You may want to consider going to bed early.
Happy - As they say, the early bird catches the bookworm!
Happy - Get it? Bookworm, because you're students?
Happy - Clever, isn't it?

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - ......
Sad - ...You'll get used to his lame jokes.

Yukari Takeba
I guess I'll head back to my room too.
Like the chairman said, you should get some rest. Transferring schools is a real pain when you're not used to it.
Good night.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
......
I should listen to them and
go rest in my room.

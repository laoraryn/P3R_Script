Mitsuru Kirijo
All right... This will probably be the last time we'll meet like this.
Angry - Is everyone ready?

Yukari Takeba
U-Um... Can I say something?

Yukari Takeba
I know we have to take Nyx down...
But if you think about it, that means we'll be getting rid of the Dark Hour.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Ryoji-kun mentioned that if he dies, our memories will disappear too...
Sad - So if we defeat Nyx... we might not remember any of this.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - All of our memories...

Mitsuru Kirijo
That's true. Our experiences with the Dark Hour and our Personas...
We... may lose them.

Akihiko Sanada
......

Yukari Takeba
Angry - But even if that happens... I want you all to know, I won't forget you!
Angry - Even if it robs us of all our memories together... I swear I'll still remember you all!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Haha, whaddaya mean, Yuka-tan? 'Course we'll remember each other!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - I won't forget you, either!

Ken Amada
Angry - Me neither!

Aigis
I as well.

Minato Arisato - Selection
We won't ever forget.
I'm not so sure about that.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Don't worry, even if you do forget about us, I'll remind you.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Yeah, so don't worry about it.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Thanks, everyone...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Okay!
Happy - In that case, let's promise to meet each other again after the battle, no matter what happens!

Ken Amada
Happy - Good idea! But where should we meet?

Fuuka Yamagishi
I don't think it should be the dorm. We'll come back here anyways, if all goes well.
Oh, right. Should we decide when we'll meet up too?

Akihiko Sanada
Yeah, it should be a special occasion.

Yukari Takeba
How about on **graduation day** for the third-years?

Yukari Takeba
When the Dark Hour vanishes, our memories might not disappear right away.
So we shouldn't plan to meet too soon after the battle.
And there's no other day that'll have more significance to us.

Ken Amada
Happy - Wow... You're really smart, Yukari-san!
Happy - Graduation day, huh? That's easy enough to remember.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Yeah, that sounds like our best bet... Alright, let's do it!
Happy - Now, where should we meet up...?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Ideally, a place where we can clearly see that peace has returned to the city.

Ken Amada
Someplace with a good view, then? Um...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, how about the school roof?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Ooh, nice idea!
Happy - Alright, the roof it is!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Remember how you all feel right now.
No matter what happens, we'll keep our eyes on the future...
We're not going to forget anything. And we will see each other again.

Yukari Takeba
Right.

Koromaru
Arf!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Haha, excited, aren't you?

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right then, let's get going.

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'm with you.
You can count on me.
It's business as usual.

Yukari Takeba
Yeah...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Together.

Aigis
I'll do my best.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Don't let us down!

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - This'll be easy.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...Yes.

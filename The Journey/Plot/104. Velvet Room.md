Igor   
Welcome.   
As I'm sure you are aware, you are currently in a dream.   
Now, then. There has been a change in you recently. Have you noticed?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'm not really sure.   
I think so.   
   
Igor   
I do not speak of your change in circumstances.   
I refer to the change in your mentality.   
   
Igor   
That is why I have summoned you here tonight.   
Going forward, there is one thing you mustn't forget.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The paper I signed at the   
dorm is lying before Igor...   
   
Igor   
You do recognize it—I can see that. Shall I remind you of your commitment?   
"I choose this fate of mine own free will."   
There is no need to worry.   
   
Igor   
No matter which path you choose, I shall respect your decision.   
However, you alone must bear the responsibility for your actions.   
No matter what sort of end they may bring about.   
   
Igor   
Please do keep that in mind.   
Well then, I bid you farewell.

Sad - Yeesh, it's a scorcher.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Aw man, it's already the 20th? Summer break's almost over...
Sad - ...Not that I got anythin' to do.

Junpei Iori
Sad - You'd think with special powers, the rest of the world wouldn't be so... boring...

Junpei Iori
...Hm?

Girl in a Dress
......

Junpei Iori
What's she doing...? Drawing?
She some kinda caricature artist? Nah, no way... There's no one around for her to draw.
Sad - What the heck is she drawing, then? There's nothin' interesting here.

Girl in a Dress
Out of the way.

Girl in a Dress
You're blocking my view... Move.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Huh...? Oh, sorry.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Whoa, what's with those funky colors!?

Girl in a Dress
What do you want?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Oh, uh, nothing... My bad.

Junpei Iori
Dude, how can she stand to wear that crazy outfit in this heat?
And what was up with that weird drawing...?
Sad - I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder?

Junpei Iori
Hmm, oh well...

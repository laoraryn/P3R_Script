Yamagishi is being released from the hospital today.
We all need to talk to her together.
Come to the command room once you get back to the dorm.


===============================================================================================

Shuji Ikutsuki
So, you're Fuuka Yamagishi-kun, right?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Y-Yes.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Relax, there's no need to be nervous. Go on and have a seat.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Ah... Okay.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - I just want to quickly mention that everyone did an excellent job uncovering the truth.
Ah, and one other thing to report...
I've heard that all three girls have regained consciousness.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - That's great news...

Shuji Ikutsuki
From what I understand, they each came to the school around midnight and waited for the security guard to leave.
Then, once the Dark Hour began, they were attacked by Shadows near the gate.
Happy - Because of the situation's similarities to an old ghost story, rumors naturally spread quickly.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - I knew right from the beginning that it wasn't a ghost.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - It's all my fault.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - What? Where'd you get that from? You were the victim in all this!

Fuuka Yamagishi
But all of those rumors started because I was absent for so long.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - That's totally not your fault.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I don't think we could have won that fight if you hadn't been there.
You saved our lives. That's not something just anyone could've done. Take pride in that.
You have a special power that you can use to help others.

Fuuka Yamagishi
A special power?

Mitsuru Kirijo
We call it "Persona."
And right now, our group absolutely needs your abilities. Can we count on you to help us?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Are you asking me to join you?

Mitsuru Kirijo
That's right.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Kirijo-senpai...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Only if you want to.
We won't force you to.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Arisato-kun...

Akihiko Sanada
I think you'd make a good addition to the team, too.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Sanada-senpai...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - You know, we're not trying to pressure you, so if you need some time to think about it...

Yukari Takeba
[cut 6 2 0]

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - I'll do it.
Angry - It would be my honor!

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - What? Are you sure?
If you do join, you'll have to move into the dorm.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - That's fine. I'd rather live here than at home anyway.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Thank you. We really appreciate this.
We'll have the school talk to your parents to resolve any issues.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Okay, thank you.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Wait a minute. Aren't we dragging her into this a bit fast?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Um, it's okay. Really.

Shuji Ikutsuki
One other topic I'd like to discuss is those special Shadows. We had another encounter this month.
While we still don't know where they're coming from, I do believe Sanada-kun is right.
They seem to appear alongside the full moon. This, at least, will help us plan for the future.

Junpei Iori
So... the next full moon is showtime, huh...

Akihiko Sanada
Knowing when to expect them is a big advantage for us.
Now, on the day of the fight, we'll be ready to get in the ring.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - ......

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We figured out the pattern for
when special Shadows appear...
Is this what the mysterious
boy was trying to tell me?
I should start paying attention
to the moon's phases...

===============================================================================================

Nosy Girl
Hey, did you hear?
Apparently Mr. Ekoda's in hot water!

Gossip-Lover
Really? What'd he do?

Nosy Girl
I don't know, but I think it's serious. Sexual harassment, maybe?

Gossip-Lover
Hahaha, I can totally see that!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - U-Um... Good morning...
Sad - ......

Nosy Girl
Hey, look. It's the ghost girl.

Gossip-Lover
Quiet, she can hear you!

Natsuki Moriyama
Oh, Fuuka, you're here!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Moriyama-san?

Natsuki Moriyama
I heard you started living in the dorms.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Y-Yes...

Natsuki Moriyama
You're lookin' glum today, as usual.
Well, if you got something on your mind, you can always talk to me.
You could probably use a friend, huh?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Moriyama-san...

Natsuki Moriyama
Come on, you don't gotta be so stiff.
Just call me Natsuki.

Fuuka Yamagishi
......

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Thank you.

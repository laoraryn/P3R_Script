Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's the last day of our school trip...
We'll be leaving Kyoto by bullet train
this afternoon. I'm free until then.

Ms. Toriumi
Okay, everyone! You all remember when we're meeting at Kyoto Station, right?
You better make sure you're on time. If any one of you is late, I'm the one who pays the price.

Junpei Iori
I thought Kyoto was gonna blow, but it actually wasn't that bad.
Sad - Well, mostly 'cause of last night.

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - ......

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - You're talking about the hot spring, right?

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - Dammit, keep your voice down!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Crap, here they come!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Hm? What's going on, guys?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Oh, uh, we're just having a, um... a reflection meeting.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Uh, what're you reflecting on?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Huh? O-Oh, don't worry about it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Exasperated* - Okay...

Yukari Takeba
Well, whatever.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Whew...
Sad - This secret stays between us, got it? You guys better take it to the grave.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Welp, I'm never gonna forget Kyoto.
Sad - Not like I could, even if I wanted to...

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - ......

Ryoji Mochizuki
Sad - You weren't kidding about the whole execution thing...

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - Just try to forget about it.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Crap, here they come!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - ......

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - ......

Aigis
......

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Not a word, huh...

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - Look out, it's Mitsuru!
Hurt - Brace yourselves!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
......
Mitsuru walked past us without
a single glance in our direction.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Damn, not even a dirty look!

Ms. Toriumi
Let's begin, shall we?
I'm not going to say much, though. In the end, it's your decision.
All right, first question...
After you graduate, are you planning on going to college, or getting a job?

Ms. Toriumi
...I see.
Well, if you've already thought about it and made your choice, then there's nothing else for me to say.

Ms. Toriumi
Well, you still have another year until you graduate.
It's okay if you still haven't decided. Just don't put it off for too long.

Ms. Toriumi
What's most important is that the decision is yours, and yours alone.
If someone else makes it for you, you'll regret it later.
And then, you'll have to live with the consequences, whatever they may be.

Ms. Toriumi
But to be honest, I'm not that worried about you.
You've really matured over this last year. In fact, you've changed so much, I almost don't even recognize you.
Don't tell me you haven't noticed.
What do you think has helped to bring about this change the most?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Working hard
Meeting people
Losing a friend
Nothing

Ms. Toriumi
...I see.
Well, whatever the reason, you should be proud of the young man you've become.
That's all for now. I hope you have a successful third year.

Ms. Toriumi
Let's see, uh... Who's next?
...Ah, Aigis-san.

Ms. Toriumi
Would you mind letting her know?
Thank you.

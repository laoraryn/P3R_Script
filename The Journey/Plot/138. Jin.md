Jin
Angry - I'm nowhere near Takaya's level, but I've improved since we last fought. You can't hide your weaknesses from me!

Jin
...Hm? What the hell...? You covered up all your weaknesses!?
Angry - Damn cowards... Can't even handle getting knocked down!?

Jin

Jin
Angry - Tch, you guys are as tough as ever... But I ain't gonna lose this time!

Jin
Hurt - No... Not yet. We're just gettin' started... You ain't the only ones who came prepared...

Jin
Angry - Watch this... Now you'll see what I can really do!

Jin
Hurt - You're not... beating me... I'll die before I let you pass!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Ngh, this is... nothing!

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - Damn... He just doesn't give up.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The shrine is bustling with
people enjoying the festival.
Coming here by myself feels a little lonely...

Aigis
What are those?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Those are masks. They're worn over the face as a form of recreation.

Aigis
One can find enjoyment by hiding one's face?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hiding your face isn't the objective, exactly. Rather, you get to experience having a different one.
Hm... Putting this into words is proving difficult...

Aigis
So then, by wearing a different face, you are able to become a different version of yourself?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - Yes, that's about right. Your degree of comprehension is actually quite stunning.
At this rate, a few more tests and the chairman may give you permission to go out on your own.

Aigis
I look forward to that.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
They continue to chat...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Call out to them
......

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
They didn't seem to hear me...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After looking around a bit longer,
I decided to go back to the dorm.

===============================================================================================

Mitsuru Kirijo
It looks rather busy... Aigis, be sure not to stray too far from us.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Are my words even registering to you?

Minato Arisato - Selection
She can't help it.
Should we hold hands?

Aigis
Yes. With the amount of data there is to collect here, I cannot help taking time to process.

Aigis
I see. So you wish to restrain me.
Be warned that my ability to jettison my hand from my wrist would make holding it a poor method of restraint.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Fine, fine... Just make sure to stay close to us.

Aigis
...?
This aroma...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - This is takoyaki. Would you like to try some?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Shopkeep. I would like to purchase one.

Takoyaki Vendor
"Shopkeep"...? Um, got it, coming right up.
Well, aren't you a lucky guy with two beautiful ladies. I'll throw in an extra for ya, on the house!

Aigis
Sad - "On the house"...? Do the takoyaki have some kind of architectural purpose?

Aigis
......
Happy - Ah! Extremely high-temperature juices have spurted out from inside.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I'm glad you're enjoying it. Looks as though you've had another valuable experience.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - You should have some too, Arisato.
Happy - Show Aigis the true nature of takoyaki.
Sad - As for me... I'll have to decline.

Aigis
What are those?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Those are masks. They're worn over the face as a form of recreation.

Aigis

Aigis
I have won a water pistol.
Between this and my onboard firearms, which is more effective in combat against the Shadows?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - ...Here, let's trade.
Sad - In exchange, I'll give you these marbles I won.
Happy - They're beautiful, don't you agree?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Well, I think we've seen all the vendors now. It's starting to get late, so let's head back.

Aigis
Not yet. The mystery of the shooting game is yet unsolved.
I precisely struck the item to unbalance its center of gravity, yet it did not even budge.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - ...Perhaps you should ask Iori the trick behind it when we return.
Happy - Come on, let's go.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We decided to go back to the dorm.

Akihiko Sanada
You're back.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Senpai, I hear you made a full recovery!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Congrats, man!

Akihiko Sanada
I gotta catch up on my training. I've basically been slacking off for a whole month.

Yukari Takeba
Shouldn't you take it easy, though? You don't wanna reinjure your arm.

Akihiko Sanada
I've already wasted enough time.
Besides, we found another Persona-user.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - We did!? Sweet!
Happy - Are they a girl...?

Akihiko Sanada
Yeah. She's a second-year who goes to our school.

Minato Arisato - Selection
What's her name?
Who is she?

Akihiko Sanada
Fuuka Yamagishi. Do you guys know her?

Yukari Takeba
Yamagishi? I think she's in Class E...
I don't see her at school very much. She gets sick a lot, from what I heard.

Akihiko Sanada
She was at the same hospital as me. That's how we found out about her.
But considering her health, she probably won't be able to fight.
It's too bad. We already had an Evoker ready for her, too...

Junpei Iori
Surprised - What!? We're giving up on her already!?
Happy - But I was gonna offer her some private lessons...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - ......

Junpei Iori
Why're you lookin' at me like that?
Sad - ......
Sad - C'mon...
Sad - Just quit it, okay!?

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Phew, what a workout. I gotta teach those first-years how to clean up properly.

Female Voices
Hahahahaha!

Brunette Student
Hahahahaha!

Brunette's Friend
Hahahahaha!

Yukari Takeba
Hm?

Brunette Student
So then I pretended to take a picture with my cell phone.
And she totally freaked out and started crying!
Very happy* - It was like we caught her red-handed or something!

Brunette Student
You should've seen the look on her face.
Very happy* - It was priceless.

Brunette's Friend
Wow, that's pathetic!

Brunette Student
Very happy* - I've never laughed so hard in all my life!

Female Voices
Hahahahaha!

Brunette Student
Very happy* - Hahahahaha!

Brunette's Friend
Hahahahaha!

Yukari Takeba
They're making fun of someone?
Tch, bullies...

Brunette's Friend
Huh? Did you hear... a voice?
It's... calling me...

Brunette Student
Huh? What voice? I don't hear anything.

Brunette's Friend
......

Brunette Student
Sad - Uh, Maki? What's going on? Are you listening to me?

Brunette Student
Maki! Hellooo!

Brunette's Friend
......

Brunette's Friend
Huh?

Brunette Student
Are you feeling all right?

Brunette's Friend
Y-Yeah, yeah, sorry. Uh, what were we talking about?

Yukari Takeba
They're finally gone.
Sad - Ugh, I can't stand girls like that.

===============================================================================================

Classmate's Voice
Hey, did you hear about that girl in 2-E?

Classmate's Voice
Yeah, I heard they have no idea what happened.

Classmate's Voice
Oh my god, isn't it so bizarre?

Junpei Iori
Man, everyone's talkin' about it. People sure got a lotta time on their hands.
So, you hear about it too?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I haven't.
I'm not interested.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Pfft, what, you think you one of them cool city slickers?
C'mon, you gotta keep up with stuff like this.

Junpei Iori
A girl from 2-E went missing while she was out late last night.
And this morning, they found her lying in front of the school gate!
Nobody knows what happened, and supposedly she's still unconscious.

Yukari Takeba
Morning.

Junpei Iori
Yo, Yuka-tan.
Man, this is a tough case, even for Junpei Iori, Ace Detective.

Yukari Takeba
Ace Detective?
Sad - You're so dumb.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - ......

Yukari Takeba
Sad - More like Stupei, Ace Defective.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Where'd that come from!?
Actually, now that I think about it, I haven't seen you all morning. Where've you been?

Yukari Takeba
I was talking to the teacher.
That girl they found... I saw her yesterday, on my way back from practice.
She seemed just fine then...

Junpei Iori
Huh...
The plot thickens...

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We're switching to the
summer uniform today...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's almost time to leave...

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
Hey, Yuka-tan, you ever check out the student message boards and stuff?
You know how last week that girl was found by the front gate?
Well, now they're sayin' it was an angry spirit from this one ghost story that did it!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - C'mon, nobody really believes that stuff. Right...?

Mitsuru Kirijo
What's this ghost story about?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - What!?
Sad - I-It's probably made up. We don't need to go into details, do we?

Akihiko Sanada
I'm interested. Go on, tell us.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Ngh...

Junpei Iori
You got it. Here goes.

Junpei Iori
Good evening and welcome to Junpei's Believe It, or Don't.
Sad - There are many strange things in this world...
Sad - Legend has it, late at night, after everyone has gone home...
Surprised - A maniacal ghost roams the halls and devours anyone caught in its grasp!

Junpei Iori
The other day, this friend of mine—let's call him "Witness A."
Sad - Anyway, he said to me, "Hey, Iori, I saw something weird the other day."
He sounded so serious, so I asked him what he'd seen.
Sad - He told me he saw the girl from 2-E.
Sad - And claims he watched her go into the school on the night before the incident!

Junpei Iori
Happy - I told him, "I don't believe it. Not even for a second!"
That girl from 2-E ain't the type to go wanderin' around at night!
But Witness A was as white as a sheet. He swore to me it was true!
Then, it hit me.

Junpei Iori
[cut 3 10 1]

Junpei Iori
Surprised - If the girl was found unconscious at school, then maybe the ghost really did make her its dinner!
Surprised - It all made sense! She went to the school at night, and walked right into its deadly trap!
Surprised - I felt a chill run down my spine, and I broke into a cold sweat.
Yes, there truly are some strange things in this world...
Believe it... or don't.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...What do you think, Akihiko?

Junpei Iori
Sad - Seriously? Not one word about my amazing performance just now?

Akihiko Sanada
I'm not so interested in the ghost part, but it does sound like it's worth investigating.

Junpei Iori
Happy - So you're afraid of ghosts huh, Yuka-tan? Didn't know you were such a chicken.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - What!? Who're you calling a chicken!?
Angry - Fine then. Let's investigate it.
Angry - Each of us will ask around for the rest of the week and gather information.
Angry - This ghost story is just a bunch of nonsense! I'll show you!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Sounds good to me. The story is a bit unnerving, isn't it?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Huh...?

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - We'll leave it to you guys, then.
Happy - Would've been too scary for me.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Whaaat?

===============================================================================================

Punk
The hell are these guys?

Punk's Buddy
Check out those rags. They're from Gekkou High.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Oh man, this is even worse than I thought.

Punk
You musta taken a wrong turn, 'cause this place ain't for you, buddy.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Uh... Well, I...

Punk
What I'm saying is, you being here is ruinin' our vibe.
Beat it, Goatee!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Goatee?

Junpei Iori
Sad - Oh, y-you mean me.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - We don't need your permission to be here.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - H-Hey! Are you nuts!?
Surprised - Read the room, won't you!?

Yukari Takeba
Angry - I can read just fine.
Angry - Come on, don't be intimidated by these punks!

Punk
What'd you just say?

Tough Chick
She just called us punks.
Come on, let's post some pictures that'll make her daddy cry!
Hope you've been practicing your sexy poses!

Tough Chicks
Hahahahah! Oh boy, that's too good!

(SE) Tough Chick
Hahahahah!

(SE) Tough Chick's Friend
Hahahahah! Oh boy, that's too good!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - These guys are scum.

Punk
Oh, so now we're scum, huh?

Punk
Man, I feel sorry for you, Goatee. This bitch is a real pain in the ass, isn't she!?


Junpei Iori
Hurt - Guh! Urgh...

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Junpei!

(SE) Punk's Buddy
Ahahahaha!

(SE) Punk's Buddy 2
Ahahahaha.

(SE) Tough Chick
Hahahahah!

(SE) Tough Chick's Friend
Hahahahah!

Familiar Voice
That's enough.

Guy from the Other Day
They didn't know what they were getting into. I'll make sure they leave.
You good with that?

Punk
Who do you think you are, dumbass?

Punk
They're not walkin' outta this! You want some too!?

Punk
Urgh... Shit!
Son of a bitch... You just crossed the line! You think you're goin' home alive now!?

Guy from the Other Day
Should we find out?

Punk
Uh...

Punk
N-No, maybe not...

Tough Chicks
Hahahahaha! Oh man, what a loser!

(SE) Tough Chick
Hahahahaha! Oh man, what a loser!

(SE) Tough Chick's Friend
Hahahahaha!

Punk's Buddy
Bastard... Your name's Aragaki, right?
Yeah, now I remember. Shinjiro Aragaki! You're from Gekkou High too, aren't you!?

Punk
Dammit, you're gonna regret this!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Oh man, Senpai, that was awesome!

Shinjiro Aragaki
Surprised - I remember you. You guys were in Aki's room at the hospital.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Angry - You idiots!

Shinjiro Aragaki
Go home. You don't belong here.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Wait!

Yukari Takeba
Sorry, but there's something we need to know before we leave!

Shinjiro Aragaki
Did Aki tell you to come here?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, sort of.
No, he didn't.

Shinjiro Aragaki
That dumbass.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Hmph.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Well, what do you wanna know? Is this about that ghost story?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Yes, that's right. How'd you know?

Shinjiro Aragaki
The rumor's been going around.
Those girls who wound up in the hospital were here talkin' shit every night.
They'd brag about all the stuff they did to some girl named Yamagishi.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Yamagishi? You mean Fuuka Yamagishi, from 2-E? They were picking on her?

Shinjiro Aragaki
That's why people are sayin' it's Yamagishi's ghost that did it.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Yamagishi-san's ghost? Wait, what do you mean by that!?

Shinjiro Aragaki
You guys don't know?

Shinjiro Aragaki
This Yamagishi girl might be dead.

Shinjiro Aragaki
I heard she hasn't been home in over a week.

Junpei Iori
Wait, what? I thought she was just out recovering.
Surprised - So, you mean she's still missing!?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - So much for that ghost story.
Mr. Ekoda is the homeroom teacher for 2-E, right? Does he know about this?

Shinjiro Aragaki
I get it, Aki. Still trying to make up for the past.
Hmph. It's you who can't let go.

Yukari Takeba
...?

Shinjiro Aragaki
Nothing.
Anyways, that's all I know. We done here?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Yeah, totally! Thanks a lot!

Junpei Iori
C'mon, show some appreciation!

Minato Arisato - Selection
Thanks.
You really saved us.
We didn't need your help.

Shinjiro Aragaki
I didn't do nothin'.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Just don't come around here again.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Huh!? The hell d'you mean!? We were in deep shit just now!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I don't have the 
to say this right now.
Maybe I could say stuff like this without
hesitation if only I was ...

Yukari Takeba
Thank you for helping us, and for sharing what you know.
Happy - That was really nice of you.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Huh?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Oh, uh, sorry...

Shinjiro Aragaki
...Just don't come here again.

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Seems like you went digging for info, too, Arisato-kun. You answered all my questions correctly.
Happy - Here, you can have this! It's a little prize for keeping your promise.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - See? I told you it wasn't a ghost story. There's no way they exist...

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
So, we're really doin' this... It's probably too late to try and back out now, huh?

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
Sad - Dude... I'm drenched in cold sweat...
But man, what Aragaki-san told us was shocking, huh.

Yukari Takeba
I'll let Kirijo-senpai know what we found out about Yamagishi-san.
The fact that she's missing is no small matter.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Man, we're totally gonna get yelled at for doing that without permission... I can already see it happening...

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Oh, Kirijo-senpai. Why are you here?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Same reason you are.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Mr. Ekoda, I'm here to ask you about a student named Fuuka Yamagishi.

Mitsuru Kirijo
[cut 223 10 1]

Brunette Student
Very angry* - No!

Brunette Student
Looking away - Please, I... I never thought it'd turn out this way.
Looking away - Fuuka...

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Hey, I remember you...

Mitsuru Kirijo
What did you do to Yamagishi?

Mr. Ekoda
Hold on, Kirijo-kun, this isn't an interrogation. Stop scaring her.
Moriyama, you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
You wouldn't want to give her the wrong idea.

Natsuki Moriyama
Sad - Fuuka, she...
Sad - She always looked so frazzled whenever I gave her a hard time.
Sad - That's when I realized. She may be a model student, but deep down, she's just like us.
Sad - And because of that... I knew exactly which buttons to push.
Angry - We were just messing with her earlier that day, too!

Natsuki Moriyama
Sad - It was May 29th.
Sad - We took Fuuka to the gym, and locked the door from the outside...

Natsuki Moriyama
[cut 3 4 0]

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Wait, what!? You trapped her inside!?

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's messed up.
That's not funny.
......

Natsuki Moriyama
Sad - That night, Maki got worried Fuuka might commit suicide, so she went back to the school by herself.
Sad - But, she never came back. And the next morning...

Yukari Takeba
She was found lying outside the front gate.

Natsuki Moriyama
Sad - I went to the gym to let Fuuka out, but the door was still locked.
Sad - So I opened it and went inside, but she wasn't there.
Sad - We all freaked out. Starting that night, we went out looking for her.
Sad - But every night, another one of us wouldn't come back, and then they all ended up like Maki!

Mitsuru Kirijo
I see.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Mr. Ekoda. All this time you've been reporting Yamagishi as absent due to "illness."
But the truth of the matter is that she was missing. You had to have known this.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - Explain yourself.

Mr. Ekoda
I was thinking of the students, of course.
You children may not understand, but we have to consider the future of everyone affected.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - So you chose not to report a missing child for "the good of the class," and not because you didn't want the police involved.

Mr. Ekoda
It... It was in her best interest.
I wouldn't want her records to be stained by something like this. Her parents agreed!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Exasperated* - So to protect your career, you ignored your responsibility as a teacher.

Mitsuru Kirijo
[cut 5 2 1]

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - Despicable...

Mr. Ekoda
Looking away - Despi—!? No, I...
Looking away - I didn't mean... I was just...

Mitsuru Kirijo
That's enough. You can go now. We'll handle the rest.

Mr. Ekoda
Looking away - W-Wait, but—


Mitsuru Kirijo
Don't worry. This won't be the last you'll hear of this.

Mr. Ekoda
Looking away - Nngh.

Mitsuru Kirijo
About your friends. Did you notice anything unusual about them before they went missing?
Anything at all?

Natsuki Moriyama
Looking away - ......
Looking away - A voice...
Looking away - A creepy voice...
Sad - They all mentioned it right before they went missing.
Sad - They said they could hear it **calling their name**.

Junpei Iori
Oh, man...

Yukari Takeba
Very angry* - Senpai, could it be!?

Mitsuru Kirijo
It's them. No doubt about it.
Up until now, we've never been able to predict who exactly would become aware during the Dark Hour. This voice must be the key.
In other words, it doesn't just happen randomly. They actually get drawn in.
Hurt - I realize now after seeing all of this: They're clearly targeting humans.
Hurt - Shadows are most definitely the enemy of mankind.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Stay at our dorm tonight. That should be the safest place.
If you hear the voice, tell us immediately.
And don't leave your room, no matter what happens.
If you can manage that, you should be fine.
Don't worry, Yamagishi should be all right as well.

Natsuki Moriyama
Looking away - Fuuka...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Arisato.
Iori and Takeba, too.
We'll meet after school in the student council room to discuss tonight's operation.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - T-Tonight!?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Yes. We're going to rescue Fuuka Yamagishi.
If my guess is right, she's still inside the school.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Understood!

===============================================================================================

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Good. You're all here.
Tonight, we're infiltrating the campus. Our objective is to rescue Fuuka Yamagishi.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Um, I don't get it. Are you sayin' Yamagishi is inside the school somewhere?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - And why are we doing this at night? At midnight, this place turns into—


Mitsuru Kirijo
Exactly.
That's how Yamagishi wandered into Tartarus.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Wait, you mean Yamagishi-san's been over there ever since she got locked in the gym?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - That's right.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - But that was ten days ago!
Sad - No matter how you look at it, she's gotta be...

Akihiko Sanada
Don't lose hope just yet.
Tartarus only appears during the Dark Hour. So where does it go for the rest of the day?

Minato Arisato - Selection
It doesn't exist...?
Nobody knows...

Yukari Takeba
That's a good point.

Akihiko Sanada
This is just a theory, but I think time flows differently in Tartarus.
So even though it's been ten days for us, it could have only been ten hours for her.
There's a chance she's still alive.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Wow, you think so?
Sad - But wait, isn't the Dark Hour pretty brutal though? Even for us?
Sad - How could she last ten days' worth in there?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - That is true...
Sad - And, even if she is still alive, we might not be able to get to her.

Yukari Takeba
[cut 4 2 0]

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - Are you just gonna abandon her then!?

Akihiko Sanada
I have an idea.
Let's try to enter Tartarus the same way Yamagishi did.
We'll go to the gym and wait for midnight. That'll be the quickest way.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Is that really gonna work?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - In all honesty, I can't say I fully agree with this.
Sad - If something goes wrong, you could all end up lost in Tartarus too.
Sad - But...

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - I'm not just gonna stand here and do nothing if there's a chance we can save her.
Angry - I'd never forgive myself.
Angry - If you guys aren't with me, then I'm going in on my own.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Senpai?

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right.
We know it's risky, but we also can't just leave her there.

Yukari Takeba
Right. And we won't know until we try.

Junpei Iori
Guess we're sneakin' into the school then!
Happy - Heheh. In that case, I've got just the thing.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - You do?

===============================================================================================

Mitsuru Kirijo
No answer.

Mitsuru Kirijo
This is a problem. I can't get a hold of the chairman.

Yukari Takeba
Well, that's not a big deal, right?

Mitsuru Kirijo
There is one issue.
Without the chairman's help, I'm not sure how we can get inside the school.

Junpei Iori
Happy - No need to worry. I've got it all set.

Mitsuru Kirijo
"All set"...?
Surprised - An explosive?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - All right, I'll let you handle this.

Akihiko Sanada
There's no time to waste. Let's go.

Yukari Takeba
An actual explosive?

Junpei Iori
Uh, no.
......
Sad - All I did was unlock a door.

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
Happy - See? We got in no problem. Man, I'm a genius!

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Is there really something to brag about here?

Yukari Takeba


Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - So you unlocked it earlier. Très bien!

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Oui, good job.
We should find somewhere to get ourselves ready. Your classroom should work, right?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Uh, what?

Junpei Iori
Sad - Tray Ben? Is that French or somethin'?
Sad - Why're they talkin' in different languages anyway...?

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Can we turn on the lights?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Aww, you scared?

Yukari Takeba
Angry - No, I'm not!
Angry - ...Stupei.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - H-Hey, that's uncalled for!

Akihiko Sanada
Quiet. We need to get started.
It's better for us if the lights are off. They cut the power at night anyway.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I don't really like sneaking around...

Mitsuru Kirijo
First, we have to find the key to the gym. It should be in either the faculty office or the janitor's room.
You three check the faculty office. Akihiko and I will take the janitor's room.
After that, we'll meet in the main hallway on the first floor. Understood?

Minato Arisato - Selection
All right.
Fine by me.

Junpei Iori
So we're searchin' the faculty office, huh?
Happy - Hey, maybe we'll find some test questions! Heheh.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Maybe I should go to the faculty office, too. It sounds interesting.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - You're not planning to do something unethical under my supervision, are you?
Angry - I suppose you'll need to be executed...

Junpei Iori
Surprised - H-Hey, c'mon! Obviously I was joking! Haha, hahaha...

Akihiko Sanada
Surprised - All I meant by "interesting" was that there's a higher chance of finding the key there.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Enough with the excuses. Let's head to the janitor's room.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Iori, you're coming with us.

Yukari Takeba
All right, let's get this over with.

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Do you hear something?

Yukari Takeba
[cut 2 4 1]

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Wh-What? There's someone else here?
Surprised - W-We gotta hide!

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Phew. It was just a security guard.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's hurry.
You're freaking out.
Think it's a ghost?

Yukari Takeba
I know.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - No, I'm not! I'm just a little nervous, that's all!
Angry - I mean, can you blame me? Everyone has something they're afraid of. This is a totally normal reaction.
Well, now that I think about it, that could've just been someone else from our group. So hearing footsteps isn't a big deal, maybe?
Happy - Haha, there's nothing to be afraid of, right? Hahaha... Why am I laughing?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - O-Of course I don't.
We already know it's not a ghost.
Angry - And besides, I'm not that afraid of—


Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Ahhh!

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - M-My phone!?
Surprised - Why now!?

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - And of course it's just spam.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I mean, that would freak most people out, right?
Sad - C'mon! The thing just rang out of nowhere!

Minato Arisato - Selection
I get that.
You get scared so easily.
That was so cute.

Yukari Takeba
Right?

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - ......
Sad - All right, fine, I'm a chicken. Happy?

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Wha—!?
Exasperated* - That's not funny, you know.

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Sad - No... No... It's so dark, I can barely read these.

Yukari Takeba
What does it say on this one?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Gym.
Storage.
Morgue.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Really? Let me see!
Happy - Yeah, this is it! I'm sure they won't mind if we borrow this.

Yukari Takeba
Are you sure? The word looks shorter than that.
Happy - Oh, it says, "Gym"!
I'm sure they won't mind if we borrow this.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - What!? Are you trying to scare me or something?
Angry - You better watch out. What goes around comes around, buddy.

Yukari Takeba
Wait a minute. This is the key to the gym!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
DEV: *Unused message labels. 
*If this appears, it is a bug.

Yukari Takeba
Okay, let's go. We're supposed to meet up with everyone in the main hallway.

===============================================================================================

Mitsuru Kirijo
Did you find the key?

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Sure did.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Y'know, I heard a scream that sounded kinda familiar...

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Huh!?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Wait, you actually did? I was just kidding!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - You wanna take this outside?

Akihiko Sanada
Guys, come on.

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right. We'll divide into teams again.
Three of you will enter Tartarus, and one of you will remain outside with me.
Once the Dark Hour begins, I'll pinpoint Yamagishi's position.

Akihiko Sanada
I'm going in.
You come too, Arisato. You can take the lead, as usual.

Minato Arisato - Selection
All right.
I'd be glad to help.

Yukari Takeba
Uh, then, I'll be the third—


Junpei Iori
Surprised - Wait a second, Yuka-tan!
Sad - Remember how I accidentally screwed up on the monorail?
Gimme a chance to make up for that!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Oh, come on! It's not always about you!
Angry - Besides, you didn't "accidentally" screw up.

Akihiko Sanada
All right, Junpei, we'll give you another shot. And with that, the teams are set.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Sweet! Thanks!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Wha...?

Akihiko Sanada
What's wrong, Takeba? Do you have a problem staying with Mitsuru?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Uh, n-no, it's fine.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It's almost time.

Akihiko Sanada
Let's go!

===============================================================================================

Natsuki Moriyama
Looking away - I...
Looking away - That's right, I...
Looking away - ......

Natsuki Moriyama
Looking away - Guess I'm alone after all.
Looking away - ......
Looking away - Fuuka...

Natsuki Moriyama
Looking away - Huh?

Natsuki Moriyama
Very angry* - No... No! I don't wanna hear this!

Natsuki Moriyama
Looking away - Calling me...
Looking away - I... I have to go to school...
Looking away - Tell her I'm sorry...
Looking away - ......
Looking away - Fuuka...

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Sooo...

Mitsuru Kirijo
We still haven't heard back from them. The transmission range is at max, too.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - ......

Yukari Takeba
I hope that girl, Moriyama, is okay at the dorm.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Unfortunately, no place is completely safe in the Dark Hour.
But we couldn't risk bringing her here. And having one of us stay behind to watch her wasn't an option either.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Yeah. I guess so.

Mitsuru Kirijo
......

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Well, we are all here for Yamagishi-san's sake—


Akihiko Sanada
Mitsuru, can you hear me?

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'm here. I've confirmed your position.
You're higher up than I expected. You're barely in communication range.
Is everyone all right?

Akihiko Sanada
...don't know... got separ...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - Akihiko! Come in, Akihiko!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Is he out of range? That's worrying...

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
...?
I must have lost consciousness...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I don't see Sanada or Junpei...

Mysterious Boy
Are you awake?

Mysterious Boy
This is the first time we've spoken outside of your room.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Where are the others?
Why are you here?

Mysterious Boy
Don't worry, you'll see them soon.

Mysterious Boy
I told you, remember? I'm always with you.

Mysterious Boy
But we don't have much time to talk.
Tonight, there is more than one ordeal you must face.
You should hurry. She's waiting for you.
You guys will need her.

Mysterious Boy
See you. I hope we meet again.

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
Happy - Hey, here he is!
Happy - Man, we were worried about you.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sorry about the wait.
I'm glad you two are safe.

Akihiko Sanada
I don't think we should enter Tartarus this way again.

Junpei Iori
Oh yeah! Did you hear a voice on your way here?
Uh, kinda like—


Mysterious Voice
Who's there...? Are you... human?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Th-That's it! That's the voice!
Surprised - Wait, didn't that come from behind us...?

Junpei Iori
[cut 3 4 0]

Pale-Faced Girl
Sad - Ah...

Akihiko Sanada
Are you Fuuka Yamagishi?

Pale-Faced Girl
Surprised - Y-Yes!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Wow, you're alive! That's awesome!
Happy - Never fear, the heroes are here!

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Good to see you're okay.
Come with us.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Looking away - Thank you so much... I...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Don't worry, you're safe now.
Are you okay?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Looking away - Y-Yes, I'll be fine... Sorry, I'm just so relieved.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Looks like I made the right call then. I'll see if I can contact Mitsuru.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - What is this place? One second I was at school, and then...

Junpei Iori
Sad - Uhhh... It's kind of a long story. We can explain after we get outta here.

Akihiko Sanada
Mitsuru, can you hear me?
......
Sad - No good. All I hear is static.

Junpei Iori
Oh, are you hurt anywhere?
You've probably seen the monsters wanderin' around, right?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - So there is something dangerous in here, then.
Sad - I've gotten by without them finding me so far.

Akihiko Sanada
Surprised - Wait, you've avoided them this entire time!?
Surprised - How is that possible?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Umm, it's hard to describe, but... I can sort of tell where they are.

Junpei Iori
Whaddaya mean? Are you saying you're psychic or somethin'?

Akihiko Sanada
She has the same power as Mitsuru.
Actually, she might be even stronger.
Mitsuru's Persona was always more combat-focused to begin with.

Fuuka Yamagishi
"Persona"...?

Akihiko Sanada
Hang on to this.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Huh!? W-Wait, is this... Is this a gun!?

Akihiko Sanada
Think of it as a lucky charm. It doesn't actually fire bullets.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Um, okay...

Akihiko Sanada
All right, let's get outta here!

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Whoa, check out the moon! It's huge!
I don't think I've ever seen it so bright.

Akihiko Sanada
There's some research that indicates the Shadows are affected by the phases of the moon.
Although, the same thing is true about humans.

Junpei Iori
That would explain Yuka-tan's mood swings.
Hey, wasn't it a full moon the night we went to the monorail?

Akihiko Sanada
Surprised - Hm? It was?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Uh, is somethin' wrong?

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - Hey, did you see the moon on the night the dorm was attacked back in April?

Minato Arisato - Selection
It was full.
No, I didn't.

Akihiko Sanada
Today is June 8th... The monorail incident happened on May 9th...

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - And the assault on the dorm was on April 9th! They were all on a full moon!

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - Mitsuru, are you there!?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Akihiko...? Shadows are—


Akihiko Sanada
Angry - Hey, can you hear me? Mitsuru, come in!

Mitsuru Kirijo
...Be caref...

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - Mitsuru!? Mitsuru!

Akihiko Sanada
[cut 6 4 0]

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - What... is that...?
Sad - It's much bigger than the others... And it's attacking someone!

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - Dammit!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - What the hell's goin' on!? I'm totally lost here!

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - It's one of them! If my guess is right, they come every full moon!
Angry - We've gotta hurry!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - H-Hey! Wait for me!

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - What!?

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - There's two of them!?

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - Mitsuru! Takeba!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hurt - Ugh... Ngh...

Yukari Takeba
Hurt - What's going on!? Nothing's working!

Junpei Iori
Angry - Sanada-san! We gotta draw the Shadows away!

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - Yeah, I'm on it. Hey! If it's a fight you want, then you've got it!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - Akihiko, be careful. Normal attacks don't work on them.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
...!?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - H-Hey! What the—!?

Natsuki Moriyama
Looking away - Ah... Fuuka...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - No, what are you doing here!?

Mitsuru Kirijo
[cut 6 4 0]

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Moriyama-san!?

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - Hey! Come back!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Please, get out of here! It's not safe!

Natsuki Moriyama
Sad - I... I had to tell you... I'm sorry...

Junpei Iori
Angry - Hey! Look out!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - ...!
Angry - I have to protect her!

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
...Persona.

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Yamagishi-san!?

Junpei Iori
A Persona?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - I can see...
Angry - I... I can see these monsters' weaknesses...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Can it be?

Akihiko Sanada
Just as I thought.

Akihiko Sanada
Mitsuru, let her take your place.
Angry - We'll handle these guys!

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Are there more of them?

Akihiko Sanada
Don't worry, it's over.

Natsuki Moriyama
Sad - Fuuka... You...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Are you okay?

Natsuki Moriyama
Sad - Yeah...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Thank goodness...

Natsuki Moriyama
Very angry* - Fuuka!?

Mitsuru Kirijo
It's all right. She's just exhausted.

Natsuki Moriyama
Sad - Fuuka...
Crying - Fuuka, I...

Akihiko Sanada
Where did those two Shadows come from?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Somewhere outside of Tartarus, just like with the dorm and the monorail.

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - Outside, huh...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Um, what are we gonna do about Moriyama-san? She knows about the Dark Hour and the Shadows.

Akihiko Sanada
It doesn't matter. She's not like us, so she won't remember anything that happens in the Dark Hour.
The good news is she didn't fall victim to the Shadows, despite hearing their call.
So I don't think she'll get drawn in again. She's safe now.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - But doesn't that mean she'll forget Yamagishi-san saved her life?
Sad - That doesn't seem right...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Actually, I get the feeling that things will work out.

Natsuki Moriyama
Crying - I'm sorry, Fuuka. I'm so sorry...

Mitsuru Kirijo
It looks like she's learned her lesson.

Natsuki Moriyama
Crying - I'm sorry...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It wasn't easy, but we managed
to rescue Fuuka Yamagishi.
That mysterious boy appeared again...
His warnings don't seem to be just dreams.
......
But I can't make any sense of it right now.
I feel way too exhausted...
I should get some rest as soon
as I get back to the dorm...

Teacher   
We'll now begin this morning's assembly.   
First, our principal has some words he'd like to share with you. Please give him a warm welcome.   
   
Principal   
Thank you.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
What's the deal with the assembly?   
You think it's about the recent incidents?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Beats me...   
He shouldn't even know about the Shadows or anything.   
I just hope this doesn't take too long...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - He's not exactly known for his brevity.   
   
Principal   
Ahem. Today, I'd like to tell you about my, um, vision for this school year.   
As you are aware, strange incidents have been reported on the news lately.   
It is my firm belief that none of you are involved.   
However, the uncertainties of high school life are many, and overcoming this will require constant effort...   
You must dig down deep inside—but don't worry so much that you lose touch with reality.   
As they say, everything in moderation.   
This is the key to reaping all the rewards that school has to offer...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The principal continues with his speech...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Wait a minute... Doesn't this remind you of Kirijo-senpai's speech?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Yeah, you're right...   
Sad - I guess he doesn't wanna be outdone by a teenager? Can't really blame him, but still.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Hey, didja hear? Sanada-san's gettin' checked up at the hospital today.   
Happy - He called me earlier and asked me to bring him somethin'.   
Happy - Yup, he knows who to count on!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
He only asked you 'cause you don't have anything better to do after school.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - H-Hey, I resent that!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Just kidding. So, what'd he want you to bring?   
   
Junpei Iori   
The class roster for 2-E.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Class roster...? What's he want that for?   
Well, I don't have practice today, so I guess I'll come along and find out.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - You're coming too, right?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure.   
I'll pass.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Cool.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - W-Wait a minute...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
What? Is there a problem?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Well, it was me he asked...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Come on, now.   
Must be important if he called us all the way out to the hospital, don't you think?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - He asked me, ya know...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - If it's important, we should all go together.   
Happy - Right?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Umm... Is... Sanada-san...   
   
Visitor   
......   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - ...in this room? By any chance?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - What are all of you doing here?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - We came to see you!   
But... you look like you're doing just fine.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That's because I'm just here for a checkup.   
   
Visitor   
We done here, Aki?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah, uh, thanks.   
   
Visitor   
Tch... I don't have time for this shit.   
   
Visitor   
You're...   
   
Visitor   
Never mind.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Wh-Who was that?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
A friend from school... Sort of.   
You know how the number of Apathy Syndrome cases has been increasing?   
Well, he knows a few people who are suffering from it, so I thought we'd have a little chat.   
Hey Junpei, did you bring what I asked?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - 'Course I did.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Thanks.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - All right, let's get going.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - I need to start seriously prepping myself.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Uh, should you be moving your arm around so much...?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - I'm fine.   
Happy - I've wasted enough time already. I need to get back to my training.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
By the way, Senpai, why boxing?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You mean, why did I choose the sport?   
Well...   
It's not the sport itself I like; I just wanted to learn how to fight with my bare hands.   
Sad - I know what it's like to feel powerless...   
Sad - I don't ever want to feel that way again.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Besides, I'm curious to see how strong I can get.   
Happy - It's like a game, only I'm competing against myself.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - That's... one way of looking at it...   
Happy - But hey, I gotcha! I'm into games too!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Yeah, video games.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oh, but like, fighting games!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - ...Whatever.

Mysterious Boy
Welcome.

Mysterious Boy
You're late. I've been waiting a long time.

Mysterious Boy
If you wish to proceed, sign your name here. It's a contract.

Mysterious Boy
There's no need to be scared.
All it says is that you accept full responsibility for your actions.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
"Minato Arisato"...
Did I spell that correctly?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Go with this
Rewrite it

Mysterious Boy
Minato Arisato... Are you sure?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I am.
I'll rewrite it.

Mysterious Boy
...Is that really your name?
This is a formal contract, you know. You shouldn't fool around.
Sign that.

Mysterious Boy
Sign here.

Mysterious Boy
Sign there.

Mysterious Boy
Sign this.

Mysterious Boy
...Good.

Mysterious Boy
Time is something no one can escape. It delivers us all to the same end. You can't plug your ears or cover your eyes.

Mysterious Boy
And so it begins...

Girl's Voice
...Who's there!?

Unknown Girl
Angry - How are you here at this hour?
Angry - Don't tell me...

Other Girl
Wait!

First Girl
Surprised - Huh!?
Surprised - The lights...

-----

Other Girl
I didn't think you'd arrive so late.
My name is Mitsuru Kirijo. I'm one of the students who live in this dorm.

First Girl
Sad - ...Who's he?

Mitsuru Kirijo
He's a transfer student. It was a last-minute decision to assign him here.
He'll eventually be moved to a room in the boys' dorm.

First Girl
Sad - Is it okay for him to be here?

Mitsuru Kirijo
I guess we'll see...

Mitsuru Kirijo
This is Yukari Takeba.
She'll be a second-year this spring, just like you.

Yukari Takeba
...Call me Takeba.

Minato Arisato - Selection
1. Nice to meet you.
2. Why do you have a gun?
3. Is this the girls' dorm?

===1===

Yukari Takeba
Uh, yeah...

Yukari Takeba
Nice to meet you, too.

===2===

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Huh?
Sad - Well, uh, it's sorta like a hobby?
Sad - I mean, not a hobby, but...

Mitsuru Kirijo
You know how it is these days. It's for self-defense.
It's not a real gun, of course.

===3===

Yukari Takeba
Sad - No, it's not, but...
Sad - How should I explain it?

Mitsuru Kirijo
There are boys' and girls' dorms, but this one's co-ed. It's a bit of an exception, you might say.
I'll explain it to you later when I get a chance.

===

Mitsuru Kirijo
It's getting late. You'll find your room at the end of the hall on the second floor.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Your things should already be there. Why don't you get some rest?

Yukari Takeba
Oh, I'll show you the way. Follow me.

-----

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Here's your room.
Happy - Pretty easy to remember, huh? Since it's all the way at the end here.
Um, do you have any questions?

Minato Arisato - Selection
1. What's that contract for?
2. Does that kid live here too?

===1===

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Huh? Contract?
What are you talking about?

===2===

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - What kid?
Sad - What are you talking about? C'mon, that's not funny.

=======

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari doesn't seem to know
what I'm talking about.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Uh... Can I ask you something?
Sad - On your way here from the station, was everything okay?

Minato Arisato - Selection
1. Yeah.
2. What do you mean?

===1===

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Huh...
Happy - Well, okay. Don't worry about it, then.

===2===

Yukari Takeba
Sad - You don't know...?

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I guess that means you're fine...
Happy - Well, okay. Don't worry about it, then.

=======

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I'd better get going.

Yukari Takeba
Um...
I'm sure you still have questions, but let's save them for later, okay?
Happy - Good night.

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Even the food was fancier than I could have imagined.   
Happy - I've never had to think about the proper way to use a fork and knife so much.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Oogh... I can't eat anymore... Not even another bite of caviar...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - No one said you had to try and eat all of it...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Well, I'm sure we're all exhausted from the trip. Why don't you go rest up in your rooms?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, are you not coming with us, Senpai?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Yes, I'll join you in just a minute.   
   
==================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - It's been a while.   
   
Takeharu Kirijo   
......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - I'm glad that you're in good health.   
   
Takeharu Kirijo   
Our guests are residents of the dorm, I presume.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm sorry for bringing such a crowd.   
   
Takeharu Kirijo   
I heard you told them about the incident.   
   
Takeharu Kirijo   
Why did you hide it for so long?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - I wasn't hiding it...   
   
Takeharu Kirijo   
I've told you time and again. None of the blame is yours.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
But—   
   
   
Takeharu Kirijo   
"Two in harmony surpasses one in perfection."   
That has been our guiding principle since the **Kirijo Family** separated from the **Nanjo Group**.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ......   
   
Takeharu Kirijo   
You must learn to trust in others, Mitsuru.   
There are things in this world that cannot be accomplished alone, no matter how many sacrifices you make.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I understand.   
   
Takeharu Kirijo   
You accessed our database, didn't you?   
   
Takeharu Kirijo   
That brings me to my next question. Why didn't you ask me directly, instead of using this trip as an excuse?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - I... I'm sorry.   
   
Takeharu Kirijo   
Bring them here. All of them.   
   
Takeharu Kirijo   
I have no intention of concealing the truth from them. I've made preparations to disclose everything.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Everything?   
   
Takeharu Kirijo   
There's a girl named Takeba in your group, correct?   
For her to awaken to her power... It must be fate.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Father...?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Takeharu Kirijo   
From what I understand, Mitsuru has already given you the short version.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, yes...   
   
Takeharu Kirijo   
Well, it's true. We adults are to blame.   
If I could've atoned for it with my life, I would have done so.   
Now, I have no choice but to rely on you.   
   
Takeharu Kirijo   
What my father wanted to create with those monsters' power...   
It was a **time manipulation device**.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That's what he was trying to do?   
   
Takeharu Kirijo   
Imagine if you could control the flow of time, eliminate unwanted events before they occur.   
With such a device, you could shape the future to your liking.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Damn, that's insane.   
   
Takeharu Kirijo   
Unfortunately, under my father's direction, the research began to stray from its original goal.   
In his later years, my father seemed to have only nihilism in his heart.   
   
Takeharu Kirijo   
In fact, his madness may have resulted from his struggle to break free from that.   
   
Takeharu Kirijo   
It's only natural that you want to know the truth. And it's my duty to tell you.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - What's this?   
   
Takeharu Kirijo   
This is the only existing footage of the accident, recorded by a scientist who was at the scene.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ...A video recording?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Scientist   
I can only hope that this recording   
reaches someone with a conscience...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Wait a sec...   
   
Scientist   
My employer has become   
obsessed with a loathsome idea.   
   
Scientist   
This experiment should never   
have been conceived...   
   
Scientist   
I'm afraid the damage will be staggering.   
At this point, it's unavoidable...   
   
Scientist   
But... I didn't have a choice... If I didn't do this...   
it could have destroyed the entire world!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Destroyed the... entire world?   
   
Scientist   
Whoever is watching this, please...   
I need you to listen to me very carefully.   
   
Scientist   
The Shadows that were amassed here have   
been dispersed as a result of the explosion.   
   
Scientist   
In order to end this, you have no   
choice but to eliminate all of them!   
   
Scientist   
I am the one responsible for this.   
   
Scientist   
I knew the risks, but I was blinded by the promise of   
success... And so, I chose to continue without objections.   
   
Scientist   
I am... responsible...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Huh!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Dad?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - You mean that was...?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Father...   
   
Takeharu Kirijo   
His name was Eiichiro Takeba. He was the head researcher at the time, and a very talented man.   
But, we are the ones who are responsible. We pushed him to continue the research.   
The Kirijo Group is to blame for his death.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
A-Are... you...?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
So, that means... my dad caused it all?   
The Dark Hour, Tartarus... the people who died...   
It was all his fault?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
H-Hey...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - So is that why you were hiding this?   
Angry - Because you felt sorry for me? Is that it!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - No, Takeba, I...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
[cut 2 2 1]   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - I don't want your pity!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Takeba!   
Sad - ......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Um... Shouldn't someone go after her?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Arisato...   
Sad - Will you go?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
...Sure.   
Why me?   
Just let her be...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Thank you.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - I doubt she'd listen to me.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Please, just go and check on her.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I believed in him for so long.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - This is too much.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Arisato-kun...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Remember what I told you at the hospital?   
How my dad died when I was little?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You understand now, right? He died in that incident.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Nobody knew the truth, so there were all sorts of rumors.   
Because he was in charge of the research team, people were really mean to me and my mom.   
We even had to move a few times.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I see...   
That must've been tough.   
What did they do?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...Yeah.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Sorry, I'd rather not talk about it.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
But all this time, I kept telling myself it wasn't his fault.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I loved him a lot, and I believed he'd never do anything wrong.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I received a letter back in spring. It was from him, written ten years ago.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - It cracked me up 'cause, even though he said, "To my family," it was more or less all about me.   
Sad - And that only made me believe in him more.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
When I found out I had a special power, I thought it was fate.   
I was scared, but I thought if I cooperated with the Kirijo Group, I might find out what really happened.   
That's why I agreed to fight using my Persona.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - But now... Now I can see it was all for nothing.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's not true.   
I guess so...   
Come on, cheer up.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - You're just trying to make me feel better.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - ...Sorry, not gonna happen.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Reality sure is harsh, huh?   
Sad - I tried so hard to fight my fear, and this is what I get.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
And, you know... I think maybe I was jealous too.   
I mean, after all that's happened, why does Kirijo-senpai's father get to live?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - ...I'm a horrible person, aren't I?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Not at all.   
Don't blame yourself.   
That's how life is.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Wow, I don't know how you do it.   
You're always so calm. Nothing ever fazes you.   
Did you really think I could just be cheered up so easily?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
[cut 2 2 1]   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - You think you know me!?   
Angry - You don't know anything!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - I'm sorry.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - I can barely make sense of all of this.   
Looking away - I'm so afraid.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Crying - I just feel so lost now.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Just tell me, what am I supposed to do now?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Don't lose hope.   
It's okay not to know.   
Stay with us and fight.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You mean, keep believing?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Huh?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Really?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You really are something else.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - ...Sorry for acting like this. I know you've lost your parents too.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I'll be all right. I'm used to dealing with stressful situations.   
Anyway, thanks for listening.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Lemme guess. Senpai asked you to bring me back, right?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah.   
I wanted to help.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Haha, I thought so. But, still.   
Happy - Thanks.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari is laughing, though her   
eyes are red from all the crying...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Haha, aren't you a smooth talker.   
Happy - Thanks though.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari is laughing, though her   
eyes are red from all the crying...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Hug her   
Don't do anything   
   
Yukari Takeba   
......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Ha... This is kinda awkward, huh?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Heyyy!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeesh, what's takin' you guys so long? Everybody was getting worried.   
It's almost the Dark Hour, so we gotta head back.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Huh? Oh, yeah, that's right.   
   
Junpei Iori   
...Uh?   
Did I miss something?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
No, I-I just almost forgot. It doesn't matter where you are when the Dark Hour comes.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - C'mon, that's common sense! Even I remembered that.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You know, I've been thinking lately.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Once you awaken to the power of Persona, you remember everything that happens during the Dark Hour.   
In exchange for power, you can no longer look away from the things you don't want to see.   
We can't escape reality, can we?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I guess we've just gotta stay strong, huh?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Yeah, guess so.   
Happy - Alright then! Let's head on back!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
...?   
It feels like I'm being watched again...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
......   
I decided to head back anyway.

Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'll ask you one more time...   
Is Chidori your real name?   
   
Chidori   
Angry - ......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What kind of organization is Strega? Are there others besides you three?   
   
Chidori   
Angry - ......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Ugh...   
   
Voice in Hallway   
Hey! Wait, Junpei!   
You're not supposed to be here, remember!?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Very angry* - Chidori...!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Junpei!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Um... Sorry. He wouldn't stop asking about where she was...   
   
Junpei Iori   
How're you feeling? Looks like you calmed down now.   
   
Chidori   
Sad - ......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
She certainly has. In fact, she won't say a word.   
...Maybe we should confiscate her sketchbook, too.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Come on, you don't have to go that far!   
Angry - Taking that away isn't gonna make her talk!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm not so sure.   
She was quite upset when we took her Evoker.   
Speaking of which... Where did you get your hands on that?   
   
Chidori   
Sad - Medea...   
   
Chidori   
Very angry* - Give it back to me! I want her back!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Hey, didn't I tell you not to bring that up!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - What else am I supposed to do!?   
Sad - ...I'll have someone else try next time.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
   
Chidori   
Very angry* - Why...? Why did you take her from me? Medea...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Takeba, call a nurse. We're done for today.   
I'll let Ikutsuki-san know we're having difficulties.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh... Okay.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
C'mon, Junpei, let's go.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Chidori... What happened to you...?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What do you think, Yamagishi? Do you sense anything?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - No...   
   
Chidori   
......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - By refusing to speak, you're only hurting yourself.   
Sad - We aren't trying to keep you hostage; we just want to avoid unnecessary confrontation.   
   
Junpei Iori   
...How's Chidori?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You're back again? Why are you so hung up on her, Junpei?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Did she say anything?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Not a word.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Let me talk to her.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Iori... You're getting really emotionally invested in this.   
Is everything all right?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Well...   
Angry - I know she attacked me, but...   
Angry - I don't know, I just can't get her out of my head! Please, let me do this!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Junpei-kun...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Geez...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Mmm... Desperate times call for desperate measures, I suppose. All right, see if you can get through to her.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Got it!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - You okay?   
   
Chidori   
Sad - ......   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - I'm glad they let you keep your sketchbook...   
Sad - Wow, you're still drawing pictures, even in the hospital?   
Sad - You really do like to draw, huh?   
   
Chidori   
Sad - ......   
Sad - ...It doesn't matter.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - She spoke to him...   
   
Chidori   
Sad - Only I can understand my drawings...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Wait... Chidori!?   
Surprised - Your arm! It's bleeding!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Tch... Not again!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Yamagishi, get the doctor!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - R-Right!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - What happened!? Why're you bleeding!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - She does it to herself.   
Angry - I thought I took all the sharp objects in here.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - She did this to herself...!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ...Apparently, we can't leave her unattended for even a moment.   
Sad - But at the very least, she seems to heal at an astonishing rate...   
   
Chidori   
Sad - Let go of me!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Then, that cut on your hand back at the station... You did that to yourself!?   
   
Chidori   
Sad - ...I never asked for you to worry about me.   
Sad - You were the one who jumped to conclusions.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Well, I want you to stop.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - You can't be doing that...   
Sad - I'm not just saying this because I'm worried about you.   
Sad - I don't want to see you hurting yourself... Alright?   
   
Chidori   
Sad - ......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The doctor will be here soon. You should head back.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - ...Right.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...So, you seem to have found your voice.   
   
Chidori   
Sad - ......   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Yo, Chidorita!   
   
Chidori   
Sad - ...Don't call me that.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - C'mon, lighten up!   
Happy - Here, I brought you a new sketchbook. I thought your old one might be getting full.   
   
Chidori   
Sad - I don't remember asking you to do that, Junpei.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Heheh, you finally called me by my name... I wasn't sure if you'd ever say it again.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
......   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
......   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...Any luck?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
She finally started talking.   
But she hasn't said anything useful so far.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Well, it's a start. More of a response than we got from her.   
So... why're you here?   
   
Chidori   
Hurt - Augh...!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Chidori!? What's wrong!?   
   
Chidori   
Hurt - Ugh... Agh...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - What is that...? There's something right there!   
Angry - An enemy!?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Angry - Wrong! Move!   
   
Chidori   
Hurt - *gasp* *gasp*   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Chidori!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Relax... Her Persona just went berserk. It happens.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - It... happens?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Weren't you guys watching? You could see her Persona strangling her for a second.   
They're not like us. They can't fully control their Personas.   
That's why they need to take suppressants. To keep their Personas from killing them...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Suppressants...?   
Wait... Do you know something about Strega?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Sad - Some things you only pick up steppin' off the straight and narrow.   
I'll give the doc the meds I have... The rest is up to you.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Shinji, wait!   
Angry - Hey!   
   
Chidori   
Sad - Uh... I...   
Sad - ...Junpei?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Thank god...! I thought you were gonna die...   
   
Chidori   
What do you mean...? Why do you look so scared?   
Death is nothing to be afraid of.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Wh... What're you talkin' about...?   
   
Chidori   
Dying just means you won't wake up tomorrow... That's all.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - What the hell are you saying!? ...You don't really mean that, do you?   
   
Chidori   
...Junpei?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - I don't want that! You hear me, Chidori!? I don't want you to die!   
   
Chidori   
Junpei...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - It doesn't matter if you're not afraid... That's not the point!   
Angry - I don't wanna have to live in a world without you!   
   
Chidori   
Happy - Hehe...   
Happy - You're so weird, Junpei...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Hah... Look who's talkin'...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
No one else is gonna be here today.   
...But, they said we still can't give you back your Evoker.   
   
Chidori   
Sad - I wasn't expecting them to. That's why I'm in here in the first place.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Oh yeah, how's that cut doin'?   
Ah, right. Prolly healed already, huh.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - So... you're not drawing today...?   
   
Chidori   
Sad - Does it matter?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Well, uh, not really...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh, your flowers wilted... The heat must've got to 'em.   
Oh, I know. Why don't I go buy you some fresh ones?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - What's your favorite kind of...?   
Hey, what's wrong?   
   
Chidori   
Ngh...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Huh...? The flowers...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Those are cut flowers, right? Whoa... How'd you do that!?   
   
Chidori   
I gave them a little bit of my energy.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - I didn't know your healing powers could do stuff like that! It's like a miracle or something...   
   
Chidori   
It's nothing special. You have powers too, don't you?   
This is just another form they can take.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, yeah, I guess...   
Sad - But that's about all I've got going for me.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Without this power... I'd be a nobody.   
Sad - I just talk a big game, pretendin' like I'm some kinda hero.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Looking away - But in reality... I don't know what the hell I'm fighting for...   
Looking away - In fact... I don't even really have a good reason to live...   
   
Chidori   
A good reason... to live?   
A good reason...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - When I was a kid, I had this silly dream...   
   
Chidori   
A dream?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - I used to wanna grow up to be a pro baseball player... Pretty stupid, huh?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - But, I guess that's part of bein' a kid.   
   
Chidori   
Sad - I wouldn't really know.   
   
Chidori   
I don't remember much from my childhood.   
I only remember one thing...   
   
Chidori   
Sad - Being surrounded by white... Everything was white...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh...   
   
Chidori   
Sad - I hate hospitals...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Oh, you do...   
Sad - ......   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Sorry...   
   
Chidori   
But you've been coming to see me here...   
So I don't mind as much, this time.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Chidori...   
   
Junpei Iori   
D-Do you mean it?   
Then... I'll come to see you every day.

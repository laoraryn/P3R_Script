In the midst of my warm welcome back,
the Dark Hour is quietly coming to an end...
This time, never to return...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The battle has ended.
By an unexpected miracle, the
world was saved from the Fall.
Peace was restored, and people
resumed their busy lives.
No one remembered anything about
the extraordinary turn of events.
And so, the season changed...

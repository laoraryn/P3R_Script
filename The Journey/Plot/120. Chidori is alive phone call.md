Hrm...

Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Hello.   
It's me. Sorry for calling so late.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Now then, about the new arrival from the other day...   
Sad - I'd like to ask... that you perform a full autopsy.   
If we find any distinctive features, we may be able to locate her family. Also...

I can't help but think that the Kirijo Group is connected to Strega in some way.   
Considering this, I think it would be disrespectful to sweep her death under the rug.   
And of course, I'll take full responsibility—

Surprised - What? What did you just say?   
Surprised - ......   
Surprised - Transmogrified!? The body!?   
......   
But judging by the postmortem, we were certain she was—   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right.   
Sad - I'm sorry, but please keep this strictly confidential until we know more.   
If there are any other changes... Yes, absolutely.   
Right, then.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - What is going on?   
Sad - ......   
I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens for now.

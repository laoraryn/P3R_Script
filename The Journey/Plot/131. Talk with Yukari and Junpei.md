It's nice and warm out today.   
   
MSG_003_0_0   
Wanna come to the rooftop?   
It'd be nice to have a little chat up here.

Hey.   
   
MSG_007_0_0   
You're free, right? Come hang out on the rooftop for a bit!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Aigis   
Happy - It has been a while since we attended class.   
Happy - The teachers and our classmates seemed to be doing well.   
By the way, did you notice that Junpei-san was missing?   
   
Aigis   
I saw him head for the rooftop before afternoon classes started.   
Perhaps he decided to skip the first day of the semester?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Seems like both Junpei and   
Yukari are on the rooftop.   
I decided to meet them there.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Oh, Arisato-kun.   
Happy - Sorry, I don't really have a reason to be up here, I just sorta felt like it.   
Only to find Junpei here, as well.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Ahaha, I guess I just felt the urge myself.   
Happy - Maybe we've been through so much together that our wavelengths are in sync.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - That's just your imagination.   
Exasperated* - If I'm on the same wavelength as Junpei, I'd better change the channel...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Anyhow, it's so nice today, isn't it?   
Happy - The wind's a little chilly, but the fresh breeze feels great!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Lookin' from here, the view ain't that bad.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It's familiar scenery, but I guess that's why it's so calming...   
The end almost doesn't feel real...   
   
Junpei Iori   
People have been passing out and disappearing out of nowhere lately, huh?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - They've been talking about a lot of Shadow-related incidents on the news, too...   
Sad - Mitsuru-senpai said it's because there are too many Shadow victims—the memory revision can't keep up.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - I don't really get it, but this is all 'cause of Nyx, huh...   
Sad - Feels like the world's hit rock bottom. There's even weird cults popping up.   
I guess this won't be one of those, "Oh, it was just a dream" moments...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
We'll figure out something.   
There's still time.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, that's the plan.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Mhm. We'll do whatever we can... No regrets.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I'm not gonna try and act cool and say things like, "I want to protect everyone," but...   
I couldn't handle it if the time we spent together disappeared.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yep.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - In fact, the tales of the amazing battles I survived should be handed down through every generation, forever.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Look who's talking. Weren't you the one who was sulking and giving us a hard time?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - W-Well, that was the passion of my youth... You know, I've matured since...   
Happy - You think so too, right, Minato?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I can always count on you.   
I'm expecting great things.   
No comment.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Hell yeah! I'm gonna make the final ball a home run!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Don't spoil him, Arisato-kun. He's gonna let it go to his head again.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - That's right! I'm a man with a plan! You're not gonna wanna miss this!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Mhm. Looking forward to it.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Aw, c'mon!   
Happy - Well, fine. I'll just have to make a huge comeback then! That's what heroes do!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - You never change, do you? I'm almost jealous.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - I'm not one to talk though... I got stuck in my own head and acted out, too.   
I wonder if I've grown since then...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I mean, it used to be just the three of us, right?   
   
Junpei Iori   
If you'd asked me back then, I never woulda guessed it'd come to this.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We've all been through so much this year...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, yeah. But you gotta look on the bright side.   
Our friendship is way stronger now, isn't it?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Hahaha, don't say that with such a straight face! You're embarrassing me.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
But... I guess it hasn't been too bad.   
Happy - We've gotten this far together. So, let's see it through to the end.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
We'll get it done.   
Let's end this.   
What a pain.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Yeah. Let's send 'em packin'.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - There you go again... Do you even get the situation we're in, Arisato-kun?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Minato gets the job done when you need him to.   
Happy - We just gotta do our best and send 'em packin'.   
   
Junpei Iori   
And those two guys from Strega...   
They haven't made a move, but you know they gotta be plannin' something.   
Angry - We gotta take care of them, too.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Let's show 'em what SEES 2-F's trio can do!   
Happy - Now that I got you guys, I feel way more pumped!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Oh!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - I just remembered, Junpei.   
Angry - You never gave me back that CD! In fact, you never return anything you borrow!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - What!? Oh, yeah. That... Do you have to bring it up now!?   
   
Yukari Takeba

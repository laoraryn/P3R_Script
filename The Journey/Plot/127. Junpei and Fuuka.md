Fuuka Yamagishi
Huh? Junpei-kun?

Junpei Iori
Oh, hey, Fuuka.

Fuuka Yamagishi
What brings you here?

Junpei Iori
Nothing, really.
I've been coming here a bunch lately.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Is that sketchbook, um...

Junpei Iori
Hm? Ah, yeah.
This is where Chidori and I first met.

Junpei Iori
What're you doing here, Fuuka?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, I went home for a bit. I've been going back a lot recently.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Oh yeah?

Junpei Iori
Happy - You know, you've really changed, Fuuka.
Happy - You're a totally different person from when you first showed up.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I am?

Junpei Iori
Honestly, you were kind of a wimp before, but now... you're somethin' else. I can't even describe it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - You've changed too, Junpei-kun.

Junpei Iori
Yuka-tan said the exact same thing, but I just don't see it myself.
Sad - I mean, just the other day, I was freakin' out and throwin' all that blame around.
I'm a real piece of work, aren't I?

Fuuka Yamagishi
That's not true.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Man, I was so damn scared. I just couldn't keep my shit together.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - ...I know.

Junpei Iori
Sad - I hate to admit it, but even now, I can't help bein' scared.

Junpei Iori
Yuka-tan said the exact same thing, but I just don't see it myself.
Sad - I mean, just the other day, I got all scared and freaked out...

Junpei Iori
Sad - I can be a real baby.

Fuuka Yamagishi
That's not true.

Junpei Iori
Sad - But really, I was afraid. And I'm still afraid, to be honest.
But I've been thinking about it, and I don't wanna sit around doin' nothing.

Junpei Iori
If I forget everything, that means I'd forget Chidori, too.
Sad - I wouldn't even be alive right now if it wasn't for her.

Junpei Iori
And I say to hell with that.

Fuuka Yamagishi
You're only scared because you're choosing not to run away.
We all feel that way. It's nothing to be ashamed of.

Junpei Iori
Fuuka...

Fuuka Yamagishi
That's why I want to protect everyone...

Fuuka Yamagishi
After all, the Dark Hour is horrifying to think about, isn't it?
But our Personas awakened, and we're here now.

Fuuka Yamagishi
The future hasn't been written in stone yet.
And I want to be true to myself.

Junpei Iori
True to yourself... Huh...

Junpei Iori
You're really somethin', Fuuka.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Let's fight together.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Okay.

Pharos
It's good to see you again.

Pharos
How long has it been since we first met? Time passes so quickly.
So tell me, how's life as a Persona-user?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Fulfilling.
Something's missing.
It's whatever.

Pharos
Happy - That's good to hear.

Pharos
I wonder what. I hope you find it soon.

Pharos
Happy - You're quite the whimsical character, aren't you?

Pharos
Happy - I remembered something else about the coming of the end.
Happy - It all stems from something that took place many years ago.
...Ten years ago, if I remember correctly.

Pharos
Oh...
Didn't your parents pass away about ten years ago?

Pharos
A Persona is like a mirror.
Which means, a Persona-user can never escape their true self.

Pharos
Happy - But no matter what, I won't leave you.
Happy - Because we're friends... Right?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I sense a faint bond forming
between Pharos and me...

Pharos
Happy - Good night...

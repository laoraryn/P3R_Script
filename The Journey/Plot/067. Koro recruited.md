Mitsuru's Voice
It's me.
I'm sorry to disturb you, but do you have a moment?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Coming...
Just a minute.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Good morning.
There's actually something I need to tell everyone.
...But, I think it would be best if you saw it for yourself.
So I'd like for all of us to meet in the command room tonight.
I'll see you then.

Mitsuru's Voice
That's okay. Just listen through the door.
There's something I need to tell everyone, so let's all meet in the command room tonight.
That's all I wanted to say. I'll see you then.

===============================================================================================

Aigis
Have we received a new mission?

Junpei Iori
I dunno, but the alarm's not ringin'...

Junpei Iori
[cut 2 4 0]

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Huh!?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Koro-chan!?

Koromaru
Arf!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Are your wounds healed up!?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Huh? Where'd you get this collar...?

Mitsuru Kirijo
That collar is designed to help control his Persona. Basically, it's an Evoker for dogs.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Wait... Does that mean Koromaru is going to fight with us?

Mitsuru Kirijo
I honestly wasn't expecting this either. But the test results show it's quite possible.
In fact, it was actually a request from the chairman. We'll be looking after him here in the dorm.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Koro-chan, is this what you want?

Koromaru
Arf!

Aigis
He says, "I'm returning the favor."

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Man, you're one loyal dog.

Koromaru
Happy - Arf!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Hey, sounds good to me. I, for one, welcome him with open arms.
Happy - The more the merrier, right? Who cares if you're a dog?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Welcome to the team.
Good to have you, boy.

Koromaru
Happy - Arf! Arf!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Alright, I'll take him for a walk. And it's the perfect time, 'cause it's summer break!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Yes, it is.
You're free to enjoy your vacation, but don't forget about your schoolwork.
Summer classes start next week, so don't lose focus just because we have a lot of time off.

Junpei Iori
Summer... Wait, what'd you say?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Summer classes. Did you not hear about them?
We're going to be taking supplemental courses. I've already applied for all of us.
I know how difficult it's been to balance both school and our late-night excursions.
Sad - I'm sure you haven't had much time to study, so I apologize for that.
The chairman agreed it was a good idea as well... I could've sworn I told Takeba and Yamagishi.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Are you serious!? First I've heard of it!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Oh, um, sorry... I completely forgot to mention it.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - No way!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Hey, you're the one with the worst grades here. Why are you so surprised?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - C'mon, I don't wanna hear it!

Junpei Iori
Sad - Ughhh... This sucks.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Don't you think?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Totally.
I don't mind.
It's whatever.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - W-Well, it's only for a few weeks, so let's do our best...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
...At any rate, we've gained a new ally.
Koromaru... He is a loyal companion
who will fight valiantly for his master.
As the team leader, I must
properly support him.

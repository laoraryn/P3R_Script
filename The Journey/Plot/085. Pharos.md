Pharos
Good evening.

Pharos
I'm sure I don't have to tell you this, but... there's only one more week until the full moon.
I hope nothing serious happens.

Pharos
But, you can never be sure what the future holds...
Be careful out there, okay?

Pharos
Happy - Remember, I'm always looking out for you.
Happy - ...We'll meet again.

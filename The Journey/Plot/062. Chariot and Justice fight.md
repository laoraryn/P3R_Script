Shuji Ikutsuki
Well, here we are. A full moon once again.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Any luck, Yamagishi?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Yes, I can sense it. There's a Shadow reading tonight, as expected.

Akihiko Sanada
That's what I'm talking about.

Fuuka Yamagishi
It's located by the deserted houses in the northern part of Iwatodai.
Sad - But, there's something strange. The reading is coming from underground... Almost ten meters.

Yukari Takeba
Maybe it's in some kind of basement?

Aigis
According to the records for the northern harbor, there are no structures that match that criteria.
However, there once was an underground facility used by the military.

Yukari Takeba
The military?
Is that true?

Shuji Ikutsuki
Well, the architectural and geographical data for the area was uploaded into her memory.
Then again, the information hasn't been updated in ten years.

Aigis
Correct. The data is ten years old.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Shouldn't someone fix that...?

Akihiko Sanada
So how exactly do we proceed?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Go underground...?
Is the facility still there?
No idea.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - We won't know more until we actually get there.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Old relics of war...
It seems the situation is still unclear at this time.
With that in mind, we'll wait until we arrive before we decide who should be deployed.

Akihiko Sanada
Agreed.

Aigis
Understood.

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right, let's go.

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Iwatodai northern harbor,
underground facility entrance...

Akihiko Sanada
Surprised - I didn't know there was a place like this so close by.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - The target should be around here somewhere...

Mysterious Voice
Ooh, well done.

Mysterious Voice
[cut 6 4 1]

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Who are they!? Lucia couldn't sense them at all until now!

Pale Young Man
It's so nice to finally meet you in person.

Pale Young Man
Happy - My name is Takaya. This is Jin.

Takaya
Happy - We are known to some as **Strega**.
Happy - Now then. We've been keeping an eye on your activities for some time.
Happy - From what we hear, you've undertaken a "righteous" battle to save the world.
Happy - Unfortunately, we've come here tonight to put an end to that.

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - What'd you say!?

Takaya
You've gained many new allies in such a short time, no doubt because this land crawls with sin.
Ah, Tartarus is towering as beautifully as always...

Minato Arisato - Selection
You know about Tartarus?
Why do you...?

Yukari Takeba
Angry - You know...?

Junpei Iori
Angry - Wait, why the hell would you wanna stop us!?

Jin
It ain't rocket science.
If Shadows and the Dark Hour disappear, we could lose our power.
And that's not somethin' we can abide by, get it?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Power...?
Angry - Are you saying you're Persona-users too!?

Takaya
I implore you to think more carefully. Do you really want to lose your abilities?
Not just anyone can wield the power of a Persona. The Dark Hour is a frontier that is ours alone to explore.
And the same goes for the Tower of Demise.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - That's your reason for stopping us!? Then you're the ones who need to think!
Angry - Who knows what might happen if we don't do something!?

Takaya
Happy - A catastrophe brought on by the Shadows... What difference does it make, really?
Happy - Disasters will always exist. And humans will always destroy each other, regardless of what the Shadows do.
Happy - Either way, no one can predict what misfortunes will befall who.
Happy - But more importantly, it's time you accepted the truth.
Happy - Surely you will acknowledge the sense of fulfillment the Dark Hour has given you.

Minato Arisato - Selection
You're wrong.
......

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Yeah! You think I like this!?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - What? You think I like this!?

Takaya
Is it not so?
How about the rest of you? Do you also wish to return to your pathetic, ordinary lives?

Junpei Iori
Angry - Huh...?

Akihiko Sanada
......

Fuuka Yamagishi
Looking away - I don't enjoy this at all.

Jin
Whatever, you all got your own selfish reasons for fighting.
That so-called "justice" of yours? Ain't nothin' but an excuse.
Angry - There's nothing righteous about any of ya. You're all just hypocrites!
Angry - Like hell you chumps are gonna stop us.

Akihiko Sanada
Surprised - What'd you say!?

Jin
Happy - Have fun in there!

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - Dammit. They locked us in!

Aigis
There is no need to panic.
Instead of wasting resources, I recommend we prioritize the Shadow first.

Yukari Takeba
Right. If we freak out, then we're just giving them what they want.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - The Shadow's moving! I think it's noticed us!

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right, let's focus on our original goal. We can look for a way out after we've won.
Arisato, go ahead and select your team. Everyone, prepare for battle.

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - This is the source of the tread marks!?
Surprised - It looks like the Shadow is using the tank as armor!
Very angry* - Get ready, everyone! Here it comes!

===============================================================================================

Shuji Ikutsuki
Yes, I'm here.

Mitsuru Kirijo
This is Mitsuru. We've neutralized the target.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Ah, good work. Come on back.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - Actually, there's been a complication.

Mitsuru Kirijo
We ran into some interference during the mission. It seems they were Persona-users.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Surprised - Persona-users!?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Yes, more than one.
They appeared during the Dark Hour, and seemed to know who we were.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Hmm...
Did they say anything that might give us a hint to who they are?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Now that you mention it...
Sad - I believe they called themselves "Strega."

Shuji Ikutsuki
Looking away - Strega?
Looking away - ......

Shuji Ikutsuki
All right, I'll see what I can find out.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Thank you.
There's... one other thing I have to report.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - We unfortunately fell into Strega's trap, so we're locked inside the facility.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Ah, I see.
Since the threat has been eliminated, I'll send someone over as soon as I can.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I'm sorry for the trouble. We'll be waiting.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Other Persona-users, hm?
......

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
......
An unexpected enemy has emerged...
They seem to be Persona-users as well.
......
But we still succeeded in defeating
the Shadows this month.
There should be fewer
victims for a while.
I'm exhausted... I can't
wait to get some rest.

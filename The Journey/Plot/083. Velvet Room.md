Igor
I've been waiting for you.
It's been quite some time since I last summoned you in your dreams.
Several seasons have come and gone since I first offered you my assistance...
Now, then, your Persona abilities... Have you been using them wisely?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Of course.
Not really...
Haven't thought about it.

Igor
I see...
Well, at least your candor is a sign of maturity.

Igor
Hmmm... So, it comes to you naturally, does it?

Igor
To be direct, I sense a great catastrophe in your future.
But it would be a pity to lose one with such potential as yourself...

Igor
Therefore, please allow me to provide you with a new form of assistance.
I will unlock further secrets of fusion, previously unrevealed to you.
I am certain that you will find this to be of great benefit.

PFM_006_0_0
New combinations have been added to Special Fusion.

Igor
But for now, you must be tired. Please, rest easy...
Until we meet again... Farewell.

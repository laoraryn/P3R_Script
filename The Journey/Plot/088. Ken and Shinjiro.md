You came... Just like we agreed.

Ken Amada
Do you know why I called you here?
You probably have an idea, since you skipped the operation for it.

Ken Amada
Sad - Two years ago today... on October 4th.
Sad - That was the day my mom died here.

Ken Amada
They called it a car accident... But it wasn't.
Sad - I saw the whole thing... I saw my mom get killed.

Ken Amada
Angry - YOU murdered her!

Ken Amada
Sad - Since then, not one good thing has happened... Just being alive is torture.
Sad - And all I get from people is sympathy, no matter where I go.
Sad - What's the point of living like this...?

Ken Amada
Sad - I've even thought about killing myself... But, I wouldn't be able to face Mom like that.

Ken Amada
Angry - That's why I vowed to live until I found her killer—YOU!

Ken Amada
I once heard you say you wanted to forget what you did on that day...
So, when I realized it was a full moon today, I knew I had to confront you.

Ken Amada
Sad - Today, Mom is with me.

Ken Amada
Angry - I'll make you remember what you did to her... I'm gonna kill you!

Shinjiro Aragaki
Do it.

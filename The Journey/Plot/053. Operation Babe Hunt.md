Junpei Iori   
Happy - Huh? Are the girls not up yet?   
Happy - Man, those sleepyheads! The ocean's not gonna sit around and wait for us, y'know?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Once the sun sets, the water temperature drops, tiring you out much faster.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Huh? Uhh, I guess. That's really what you're worried about?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Junpei, that reminds me.   
Didn't one of the maids give you something as we were leaving?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Heheh, you saw that, huh?   
Happy - One of the maids gave me a letter. Oh man, what if it's a confession of love!?   
Happy - Ahh, it sure is tough, bein' this popular!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - ...You're a moron.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Okay, let's see here...   
It says, "We've gone to see the Jomon Cedar Tree."   
Surprised - Huh?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
This looks like Yamagishi's handwriting.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Aw, man!   
Angry - We're at an island resort in the middle of summer! Why aren't they going to the beach!?   
Angry - That's just not right!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well, it is your fault.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Whaddaya mean? I just wanted to lighten the mood yesterday.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I don't want to hear it.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Well, it doesn't matter now, anyways...   
Angry - We're on our own, just the guys!   
Angry - This is the frontier of romance! We're bound to meet someone new out here!   
   
Junpei Iori   
[cut 3 12 0]   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - We'll call this: Operation Yakushima Beach Fling!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Fling...?   
You mean we're gonna pick up girls?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - How 'bout it, Sanada-san? With you on the squad, we're guaranteed to succeed!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - I should've known this was your plan.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Arisato, what do you think about this?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's begin the operation.   
Sounds like a hassle.   
I don't care.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You're right, it does sound like a hassle.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Whaaat? Don't tell me you wanna spend the whole day with just us three!   
Surprised - Come on, guys! It'll be fun!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - You two really wanna let this opportunity to enjoy our summer vacation go to waste?   
Surprised - Come on, guys! It'll be fun!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Then I'm appointing him our leader, as usual.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - What!? WHY!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You said it yourself: this is an operation.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Aw, man, that's bullshit!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - You better take this seriously, Minato. It's an important operation.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Ooh! Target sighted!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Let's move in for the kill!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Okay, this is my area of expertise, so lemme give you some pointers.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - First off, think of something to talk about—something they might be interested in.   
Happy - Give 'em an easy question to get the ball rollin'. That's the golden rule.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Somethin' like, "Where you from?" or "Havin' fun?"   
Happy - Once you get started, you'll be goin' back and forth like you're playin' catch.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - I'll start things off, then you ask the questions, alright?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Okay, here we go.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Hey there, ladies!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Where you from?   
Havin' fun?   
   
Girl in Green   
...None of your business.   
   
Girl in Green   
...None of your business.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Huh?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Hey, no need to be shy.   
   
Girl in Orange   
Why should we tell you anything?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Why? Uh, well...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Come on, we're just makin' conversation.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - ...How is this like "playing catch"?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Don't worry, I got this! Watch and learn.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - So ladies, are you in college? Or maybe you're already working?   
   
Girl in Orange   
Ummm...   
You guys seem a little young. Are you still in high school?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's right.   
Nope. Not us.   
   
Girl in Green   
High school kids vacationing in Yakushima? That kind of pisses me off.   
   
Girl in Green   
...Seriously? You sure look like high schoolers from here.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - N-No, sorry. That was a lie.   
   
Girl in Green   
Oh, really?   
   
Girl in Green   
High school kids vacationing in Yakushima? That kind of pisses me off.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - Sorry you feel that way.   
We're only here because we were invited to our friend's vacation home.   
   
Girl in Orange   
Wow, a vacation home in Yakushima? Good for your friend.   
We, on the other hand, had to save up our own money to come here.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Oh, that's a pretty big accomplishment, huh?   
   
Girl in Orange   
No, not really.   
...So, what do you guys want, anyway?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Nothing.   
We came to hit on you.   
   
Girl in Green   
Great, then buh-byyye.   
   
Girl in Green   
What? Hahaha, I like your honesty.   
   
Girl in Orange   
Ugh, don't encourage them. They'll go away if we ignore 'em.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - W-Wait, don't do that!   
Happy - How can you blame us for wanting to talk to such beauties?   
   
Girl in Orange   
These guys are full of shit.   
   
Girl in Green   
Yeah, let's get outta here.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Wait...   
See you later.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Come on, give us a chance. How 'bout a walk on the beach?   
   
Girl in Orange   
Wow, you're annoying.   
   
Girl in Orange   
See ya, boys.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...Yeah, you were "playing catch" all right.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - H-Hey, I did my best!   
   
Junpei Iori   
What about you, Sanada-san!? If that's how you feel, then show us how it's done!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Why do I have to show you anything?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, you said this was an operation, didn't you?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Aren't we supposed to work together in order to succeed?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - ......   
I guess you've got a point there.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Fine, I'll give it a shot. I'm sure I'll do better than you at least.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Can you give me a hand, Arisato? I'll go ahead and set the pace.   
   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oh, oh! Spotted a new set of targets!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
......   
   
Junpei Iori   
What're you waitin' for, Sanada-san? Show us what you got.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Just keep your mouth shut.   
   
Girl in Black   
Hey, Nobuko. Are those boys looking at us?   
   
Nobuko   
Oh yeah, they are.   
   
Nobuko   
Wow, Yoshie, I'm surprised you could see from over there.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All right, time to get in the ring.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Uh... H-Hi there.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - S-Sorry to bother you, but, um... I-I wanted to ask you something.   
   
Yoshie   
And what would that be?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Er, um... Are you two here alone?   
   
Nobuko   
Ahaha, are you hitting on us?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
N-No, no, not at all.   
We just thought that if you're bored, you might wanna talk, or...   
A chance meeting like this might stir things up for both of us, you know?   
   
Yoshie   
Um, isn't that what it means to hit on someone?   
   
Yoshie   
Haven't you heard? It's lame to hit on girls at the beach nowadays.   
   
Nobuko   
Aw, come on. We were bored anyway.   
   
Nobuko   
Besides, they look kinda cool.   
   
Yoshie   
Ugh, really, Nobuko?   
   
Nobuko   
Hey, how old do we look to you?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
About the same as us?   
Around twenty?   
   
Yoshie   
The same as you? That's crap and you know it.   
   
Nobuko   
They were just trying to be nice.   
   
Nobuko   
We've actually been out of college a few years now.   
   
Nobuko   
Seriously? We still look that young?   
Aw, I'm so happy to hear that! Even if it's just flattery.   
To tell you the truth, we're actually older than that.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - O-Oh, you are? Th-That's too bad.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - No, wait, that's fine by us! Older women are more mature and experienced and stuff!   
   
Yoshie   
Y'know, you're a pretty smooth talker for someone so young.   
How old are you guys, anyway?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Truth is, we're in high school.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'll be graduating next year.   
   
Nobuko   
Oh gosh. That's more of an age gap than I was expecting...   
   
Yoshie   
See? It's not gonna work out. Besides, I doubt you're having any fun talking to us.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yes we are.   
Right, it's boring.   
   
Nobuko   
Come on, no you're not.   
I don't think there's anything we could chat about that you'd find interesting. Unless you wanna hear me complain about my boss?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Uh, complaining about your boss... That might be fun.   
   
Yoshie   
You're not very good at lying, are you? You really don't have to try so hard.   
   
Nobuko   
Yoshie! Don't ruin the conversation!   
He said it might be fun, so just play along!   
   
Yoshie   
Wow, he called us boring.   
   
Nobuko   
What do you mean, Yoshie? He was just kidding.   
   
Yoshie   
Nobuko, you need to stop being so nice to everyone!   
   
Nobuko   
Aww, c'mon! It's been ages since I've done this!   
   
Yoshie   
You've teased these kids enough. We should head back.   
They're gonna be waiting on us, you know.   
   
Junpei Iori   
"They"...? You mean, you have boyfriends?   
   
Nobuko   
Oh, right. Sorry, forgot to mention that. Well, we gotta go now.   
We're meeting our boyfriends back at the villa for a barbecue.   
You can come if you want.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
......   
   
Yoshie   
Bye.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Sanada-san!   
Sad - What happened!? We looked like a bunch of idiots!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - ......   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - And you! You haven't been pullin' your weight either!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - You gotta come through on the next one, you hear me?   
   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
There's a woman over there all alone.   
It's unusual to find someone not in a group.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - No boyfriends to be seen in the area either! I think we're in the clear!   
Happy - Alright, time to make contact.   
Happy - Excuse me, miss!   
   
Pretty Lady   
Oh, hello! Can I help you?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Whoa, she's hot.   
Happy - Say, uh, you here alone?   
   
Pretty Lady   
Yep, and I'm sooo bored.   
I've been watching you, by the way. You've been trying to pick up girls for a while.   
Well, how'd you do?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
We were close.   
It was an utter failure.   
   
Pretty Lady   
I see. You boys are cute.   
But you know why you didn't succeed? It's because you don't understand what a woman feels.   
   
Pretty Lady   
Haha, that's what I thought. You boys don't understand women at all.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Guess I can't deny that...   
   
Pretty Lady   
You in the hat. You're way too wrapped up in yourself.   
Shouldn't you be thinking more about how to make your partner happy?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Yes, ma'am.   
   
Pretty Lady   
You in the T-shirt. You're the type that's stoic, but not very experienced with girls.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Y-Yeah, I guess that might be true.   
   
Pretty Lady   
You seem like kind of a hassle, too. Like you're super logical about everything.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - Ngh...   
   
Pretty Lady   
And you, with the long hair... I'm not sure about you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What do you mean?   
Hey, don't hold back.   
   
Pretty Lady   
Haha, I mean you're mysterious. Like, no one can ever tell what you're really thinking.   
You know what I mean?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I do.   
I have no idea.   
   
Pretty Lady   
Oh, you're so smart.   
Mhmm, I think you're just my type.   
   
Pretty Lady   
Wow, you're pretty innocent.   
Mhmm, I think you're just my type.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - H-Hey, wait a second!   
   
Pretty Lady   
Juuust joking.   
I like you a lot, too.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - R-Really!?   
   
Pretty Lady   
Want me to tell you what would make me really happy?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Y-Yes, ma'am!   
   
Pretty Lady   
Could I ask you to help me put on my sunscreen?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - What!? I mean, uh, you're alright with that!?   
   
Pretty Lady   
Of course I am. I have enough for you, too.   
   
Pretty Lady   
[cut 3 11 1]   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - OOOOOH!   
Happy - Oh man, I'm really sorry guys, but I'm not passin' up this chance!   
   
Pretty Lady   
Would you two like to join too? I'll give you a good deal.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...Deal?   
   
Delusional Lady   
You know that sun in the sky isn't real, right? That's an artificial sun that got sent into space back in the 1980s.   
   
Junpei Iori   
...Huh?   
   
Delusional Lady   
You didn't know? Turns out, that sun sends out harmful rays that mess with your body's equilibrium. Normal sunscreen doesn't work.   
But that's where this special one comes in. And if you opt in right now, you can get three bottles for just 300,000 yen!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hey, Arisato, doesn't she sound kind of strange?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Get in there, Junpei.   
Retreat, retreat!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Aaah! What the hell! Don't just leave me behind!   
   
Delusional Lady   
Whaaat, you're leaving?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - S-Sorry to bother you!   
   
Delusional Lady   
Aww, you're so cruuuel!   
   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'd rather not be doing this.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I might not like what we're doing, but I hate losing even more.   
Happy - We'll get 'em next time.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - Huh... I don't remember the last time I lost at something...

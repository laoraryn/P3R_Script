Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's day three of our vacation in Yakushima...

Junpei Iori
Man, I can't believe it's already the third day of our trip.
Sad - It's too bad we have to go home tomorrow. I'd totally stay longer if I could.
But I can't complain too much. We went through a hell of a lot here!

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - Yeah, like hearing you and the chairman singing...
Sad - I barely got any sleep last night.

Aigis
Do we have a mission at the beach today?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Nah, it's nothing like that. We just came here to have some fun.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Do you understand what it means to have fun, Aigis?

Aigis
Yes, I am informed of the concept. Recreation is sustenance for one's mental wellbeing.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Yeah, exactly! Wow, you sure know a lot about us humans.
Happy - Alright, let's take one last dip before we leave!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Uh, wait, Junpei-kun...
Surprised - Is it okay for Aigis to go in the water?

Yukari Takeba
I'm sure she's fine.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, are you done already?

Aigis
It is best that everyone partake in this activity together.
Deriving enjoyment alone is not the optimal method to "have fun."

Junpei Iori

Yukari Takeba
Happy - You've got some strong feelings on pretty weird things, don't you?
Happy - But what the heck, might as well!

Fuuka Yamagishi
We should join them.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Agreed.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Enjoying yourselves?
Happy - Quite a lot's happened during our time here, but it looks like we'll get to relax a bit today.

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - That would be nice.

Junpei's Voice
Sanada-san! What're you doin'!?
C'mon, it's your turn!

Akihiko Sanada
My turn? What are they doing?

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Hahaha! Glad to see everyone's having so much fun.
I've already told you what time the ship is arriving tomorrow, right?
I'll probably head over to the port early, so don't be late.

Akihiko Sanada
Okay, I'll let everyone know.

Shuji Ikutsuki
We can get back to business once we've returned to the dorm.

Akihiko Sanada
Got it.

Junpei's Voice
Heeey, Minato!
Sanada-san!

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - All right. I guess we should join too, Arisato.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Aigis, wait! That's not what water gun means!
Surprised - Aaaaaack!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Junpei-kun is down!

Yukari Takeba
Happy - All right, here's our chance for an All-Out Attack!

Minato Arisato - Selection
All-Out Attack!
Maybe not.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Wait, time out! I seriously can't take—! Gyaaaaaah!

Junpei Iori
Sad - I'm saved...
Sad - Seriously guys, it's just a game. Could ya not treat this like a life-or-death battle?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I had a fun time with
everyone in Yakushima...
With Aigis joining, things
are likely to get livelier...

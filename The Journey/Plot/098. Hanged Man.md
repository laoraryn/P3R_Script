Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - I think that's the Shadow's main body floating up there...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Hurt - If it's that high, your attacks won't have the range to reach it...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Wait, but... I'm picking up similar readings from those statues down there.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - There's a connection with the floating target, I'm sure of it!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Not even my arrows can reach that far...!

Aigis
Sad - Target is out of range.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - The main body is down! It looks like it loses the ability to fly when you take out those statues.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - This is your chance to attack! Give it everything you've got!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - The Shadow is back in the air! You can't attack it anymore!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - I'm getting an unusual energy reading from the main body...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - Ah! It's getting more aggressive! Watch out for stronger attacks!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - I'm picking up a powerful reading from this statue...!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - This one's not like the others. Let's do what we can to take it down!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - We're almost there. Don't let up!

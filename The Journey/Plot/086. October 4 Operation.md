Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - I've located the target...
Angry - It's in the Iwatodai Station plaza!

Shuji Ikutsuki
This will be the tenth Shadow...
Only a few left. Let's just worry about them one at a time.

Yukari Takeba
If they actually appear one at a time. We don't need two at once again...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Yukari-chan, how did you know!? I sense two of them!

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - What, seriously!? Me and my big mouth...

Akihiko Sanada
...Where's Shinji?

Fuuka Yamagishi
He notified me that he'll be joining us later.
He didn't say why though...

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - ...Figures. He's always played by his own rules.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Should we wait a little longer?
I wonder what's going on.

Junpei Iori
Eh, I'm sure it's fine. He said he's comin' later, right?

Junpei Iori
I'm sure it's nothin' to worry about. He said he'd join us later, right?

Yukari Takeba
Yeah, that's already better than a certain someone who didn't show last time.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - H-Hey, c'mon, that wasn't my fault!
Surprised - Don't worry, I'm totally ready to go this time! See?

Yukari Takeba
Wait, Amada-kun isn't here, either...
Hey Junpei, go get him. That'll be your punishment for last time.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Punishment...? What is this, kindergarten?
Sad - Well, I guess it is the kid's bedtime...

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right, we've got two targets this time. Let's get moving.
We'll decide on our team formation once we get there.

Akihiko Sanada
Let's go!

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Look, there they are!
Surprised - This is the route we always take to school! We've gotta protect it!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - It's almost like they're waiting for us...

Mitsuru Kirijo
By the way, where's Amada?

Junpei Iori
Uh, he wasn't in his room, so who knows?

Akihiko Sanada
Shinji's late, too...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Um, we should probably hurry. I think they're about to make their move.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Then we have no choice. Let's organize a team from the members we have here.
Once we're set, we'll move in!

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - Standing by to provide support! Be careful out there!

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Good job, everyone.

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - Man, it's exhausting dealing with two of 'em at once.

Aigis
The two claiming to be "Strega" did not interfere this time.

Yukari Takeba
It's probably because we have their navigator. They can't outmaneuver us now.
Anyway, I'm glad everything went well.
Still, Aragaki-senpai never showed, huh? Amada-kun, too...

Akihiko Sanada
......

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - The chairman doesn't seem to be too concerned. He's already headed home.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Yamagishi, do you know where they are?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Sorry, I haven't been able to locate them yet.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Let's return to the dorm for the time being.

Akihiko Sanada
......

Mitsuru Kirijo
Akihiko, are you listening?

Akihiko Sanada
Surprised - Today is... October 4th... Right?

Yukari Takeba
...Yeah, that's right.

Akihiko Sanada
Go on back without me. I'm gonna go look for them.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Wait, Senpai—?
I wonder what's up.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Akihiko...?

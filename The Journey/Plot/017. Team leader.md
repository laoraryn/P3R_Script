Perfect timing. I'd like to speak to you for a moment.
Regarding our exploration of Tartarus...
Akihiko is still on the mend, so for now, I'd like you to lead the team in combat.
You never know when a powerful enemy might appear, like the one you faced the other day.
It's best to be prepared, or else you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
So, whenever you'd like to explore Tartarus, just let me know, and I'll gather everyone there.

Also, since I'm sure there are other things you will need to take care of, you have permission to go out at night if you need to.
Well, that's all for now. Keep up the good work.

Junpei Iori
Looking away - No way...

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - Dammit... Not again!

Looking away - Why am I so powerless...? Am I really unable to protect the ones important to me!?
Looking away - This is what I was trying to prevent!

Very angry* - You're out there, aren't you!? I know you are!
Very angry* - I refuse to believe that you're gone!
Very angry* - Answer me!
Very angry* - I know you're listening!

Very angry* - We're here! Say something! Please!

I can hear everyone desperately
calling out to me.

Don't worry.

Familiar Voice
He's found the answer to life's greatest question.
It just happened a bit sooner than it will for the rest of you.

Aigis
Life's... greatest question...

Familiar Voice
Aigis... You'll find the answer one day as well.
Your life, too, is precious... irreplaceable.
You just need to realize how the bonds of friendship have changed you...

Aigis
The bonds... of friendship...

Familiar Voice
The Dark Hour will soon vanish from this world... You will truly be liberated from its dominion.
The legacy of life will continue.
Congratulations, you have the miracle you sought.
May we meet again someday...

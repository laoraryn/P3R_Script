Happy - Yo, Chidori.

Chidori
Surprised - ...!

Junpei Iori
Sorry 'bout not being able to visit lately.
A lot's been goin' on.

Chidori
Sad - ......

Junpei Iori
Hey, what's wrong?

Junpei Iori
Sad - So, you heard about Takaya and Jin, huh?
Sad - I was planning on telling you.
Sad - I get that they were your friends, but we had to fight them.

Chidori
Sad - ......

Junpei Iori
Huh? Is that not it?

Chidori
Sad - I was right. This fear... This pain...

Chidori
Sad - Junpei...
Sad - In two years, what will you be doing?

Junpei Iori
In two years?
Uh, I dunno. I haven't really thought about it.
Why do you ask?

Junpei Iori
Oh, almost forgot to mention, I noticed you stopped.
Y'know, hurting yourself.

Chidori
Huh? Oh, I guess.

Junpei Iori
Happy - That's good. I mean, you have such beautiful hands.

Chidori
Surprised - ...!

Chidori
Angry - Don't touch me!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Wha— Oh, I-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

Chidori
Sad - This is... too painful.
Sad - It used to be fun when you came to visit.
Sad - But now... it's different.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Huh!?

Chidori
Sad - It hurts inside. I can't breathe.
Sad - I can't take this anymore!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Wh-What do you mean!? I don't understand!
Surprised - Did I do something wrong? Tell me what it is!

Chidori
Sad - Junpei...

Chidori
Sad - Don't come here anymore.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Chidori... But why?
Sad - ......

Chidori
Sad - ......

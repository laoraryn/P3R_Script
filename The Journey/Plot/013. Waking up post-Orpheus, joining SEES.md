Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
......   
My head is getting clearer...   
......   
I can feel someone's presence beside me.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - You're awake!   
Sad - Uh, how do you feel?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
1. Where am I...?   
2. Why are you here?   
   
===1===   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Thank goodness. You finally woke up...   
Oh, this is Tatsumi Memorial Hospital. It's just a short walk from the station.   
   
===2===   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Thank goodness. You finally woke up...   
Sad - I was so worried about you...   
   
=======   
   
Yukari Takeba   
The doctor couldn't find anything wrong. He said you were just exhausted...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Hey, um...   
Sad - I'm sorry I wasn't helpful at all back there...   
Surprised - But, wow. That power of yours was really something.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
1. What were those things?   
2. What'd I do...?   
   
===1===   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You mean the Shadows?   
They're what we're fighting against.   
And that power you used... We call it "Persona."   
Sad - Don't worry, we'll explain everything later. I'm sorry I didn't tell you before...   
   
===2===   
   
Yukari Takeba   
That power you used... We call it "Persona."   
And those creatures you defeated are Shadows—our enemies.   
Sad - We'll explain everything later. I'm sorry I didn't tell you before...   
   
=======   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - I, uh...   
Sad - I wanted to tell you something.   
Sad - I can kinda relate. To you, I mean.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
1. What do you mean?   
2. Why're you telling me this?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - My dad died in an accident when I was little...   
Sad - And my mom and I aren't exactly on good terms...   
Sad - You're all alone too, aren't you?   
Sad - To be honest, I already heard about your past...   
Sad - But it didn't seem fair, so I wanted you to know about mine too.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - This was a while ago, but...   
Sad - There was a big explosion in the area.   
Sad - Supposedly, my dad died in the blast, but nobody really knows what happened...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
At the time, he was working in a lab run by the Kirijo Group.   
So I'm hoping if I stick around long enough, I'll find out more about it.   
That's why I'm going to Gekkoukan High, and why I was there when this happened to you.   
Happy - Not that I was much help... I kinda panicked. That was my first time facing them, too.   
Sad - Sorry... You wouldn't have to go through all this if I weren't such a coward...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
1. It's not your fault.   
2. I was scared, too.   
   
===1===   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - ...Thanks.   
Sad - Sorry for telling you all this the minute you opened your eyes.   
While I was waiting, I thought to myself...   
"I've been hiding so many things from him... As soon as he wakes up, I'll tell him the truth."   
Happy - So, thanks for listening. I've been wanting to share that story with someone for a long time.   
   
===2===   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Really? But still...   
Sad - Sorry for telling you all this the minute you opened your eyes.   
While I was waiting, I thought to myself...   
"I've been hiding so many things from him. As soon as he wakes up, I'll tell him the truth."   
Happy - So, thanks for listening. I've been wanting to share that story with someone for a long time.   
   
=======   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - All right, I'm gonna get going.   
Happy - I'll let the others know you're okay.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - They said you could leave once you regained consciousness, so I think you're free to go home.   
Happy - See you.   
   
-----   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Uh... Hey.   
Want to walk home together?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
1. Sure.   
2. Why?   
3. It might start rumors.   
   
===1===   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We live in the same dorm and all, and I've been a little worried.   
   
===2===   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Well... I'm a little worried.   
   
===3===   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Huh!?   
Sad - Come on, there's no need to put on a brave face.   
   
=======   
   
Yukari Takeba   
What if you pass out again on the way home?   
I feel responsible for that, you know? Let me make it up to you.   
Happy - C'mon, let's go.   
   
-----   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Home safe!   
   
-----   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I'm glad you're feeling okay now. Well, I guess I'll head up first.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Like I said this morning, meet me on the fourth floor. The chairman should be waiting for us.   
   
-----   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - Ah, there you are.   
Happy - Looks like you've recovered. I'm glad to see that.   
There are some things I need to discuss with you. That's why I asked you to see me so soon after your discharge from the hospital.   
Please, have a seat.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Oh, before that...   
I believe I mentioned his name before, but this is Sanada-kun.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Hey there.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Okay, let me start off by asking you this...   
Would you believe me if I said that a day consists of more than 24 hours?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
1. I wouldn't believe it.   
2. ...Excuse me?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Heh, that's a reasonable reaction.   
However, you've already experienced this truth firsthand.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Do you remember the night you first arrived here?   
You had to have noticed the signs.   
Streetlights going out... Things that stopped working... The inexplicable appearance of coffins...   
With so many things amiss, didn't it feel like you'd stepped into a different time?   
That's the **Dark Hour**—a time period hidden between one day and the next.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
1. Hidden?   
2. Between?   
3. I don't get it.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
I guess it's more like something people simply aren't cognizant of.   
But the Dark Hour does exist, and it occurs each night at midnight.   
It will happen tonight, and every night to come.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
It occurs each night, as the clock strikes twelve.   
It will happen tonight, and every night to come.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
I know how you feel. Who would believe such a fantastical claim?   
But the Dark Hour does exist, and it occurs each night as the clock strikes twelve.   
It will happen tonight, and every night to come.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Normal people don't realize it, since they're all sleeping inside their coffins.   
Happy - But that's not what makes the Dark Hour so interesting.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You saw them... Those creatures.   
We call them **Shadows**.   
They only appear during the Dark Hour and attack anyone who roams free outside the coffins.   
Happy - It's our job to defeat them. Pretty exciting, huh?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - Akihiko! Why are you always like this?   
Angry - You just got hurt the other day!   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Now, now. He does his work well, in any case.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
I'll get to the point.   
We are the **Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad**—SEES for short.   
On paper, we're classified as a school club. But in reality, this group is dedicated to defeating the Shadows.   
Mitsuru Kirijo-kun is the leader, and I'm the club advisor.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
A Shadow feeds on the mind of its prey; the victim becomes a living corpse.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
**Apathy Syndrome**—I'm sure you've heard of it. We sometimes refer to those who suffer from this as "the Lost."   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
They're responsible for most of the incidents on the news, if not all of them.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
1. How do you fight them?   
2. What about the police?   
   
===2===   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Unfortunately, the police can't do a thing during the Dark Hour...   
   
=======   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Although rare, there are those who can function during the Dark Hour.   
Some may even awaken to a power that enables them to fight Shadows.   
That's known as "**Persona**"—the power you called upon the other night.   
Shadows can only be defeated by Persona-users.   
That means you are the only ones who stand a chance against them.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
1. I see.   
2. I don't understand.   
   
===1===   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - I'm glad you're quick to understand.   
   
===2===   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What he's trying to say is, we want you to join us.   
We've prepared an **Evoker** for you. We'd like you to lend us your strength.   
   
=======   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
1. All right.   
2. I'm not sure I'm ready.   
   
===1===   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Whew... I was afraid you'd say no.   
Happy - I'm glad to hear you're on board.   
   
===2===   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Don't think too hard on it. Just hang out with us for a while.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Please, we need your help.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Wait, don't pressure him like that! What if he feels like he can't say no?   
Sad - I mean, I'd like it if he joined too, but...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
1. ...All right.   
2. Okay, for now.   
3. I don't mind.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Thank you.   
Happy - If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Does that mean you accept?   
Happy - Whew... I was afraid you wouldn't do it.   
Happy - I'm glad to hear you're on board.   
   
=======   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - We really appreciate it. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - Thank you so much, truly.   
Oh, I almost forgot. About your room assignment...   
Why don't you just stay in the room you have now?   
Happy - I don't know what the holdup is, but I guess it worked out in the end! Hahahaha!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Holdup? But, wasn't that—   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Oh, never mind...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I joined SEES to fight the Shadows...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
...!?   
I can hear a voice ringing inside my head...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel my inner strength growing...   
I recall what Igor said about   
the power of Social Links.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Well, that's all for today.   
I'll follow up with you regarding our "club activities" later on.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
I apologize for gathering you all here on your precious day off.   
Tomorrow is Sunday, so take some time to relax.   
Happy - Well then, shall week-end this meeting?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
You know, because it's the weekend?   
Happy - "Shall we end"... "Shall week-end"... Get it?

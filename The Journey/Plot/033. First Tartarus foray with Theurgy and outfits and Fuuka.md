Looks like we're here.   
Yamagishi, do you copy?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Y-Yes! I'm here!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Are you picking up any Shadows?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Umm... It looks like there's one close by. Be careful!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right, then let's head over there and get a feel for things, Arisato.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looks like everything went well.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Fuuka, you were amazing! Great job!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Thank you, Yukari-chan.   
I still sense some enemies nearby. Keep an eye out if you decide to engage them.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Oh, we're engaging them, all right.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well, the combat uniform seems to be working out. But what about that "Theurgy" thing?   
Yamagishi, have you figured anything out on your end?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm sorry, it's still unclear. I am picking something up during battle, though...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
There's no pressure. Just continue your observation.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
...Hang on!   
I'm sensing something on the floor above us. Something strange...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Is it some kind of powerful Shadow?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
No, it's... It feels similar to the distortion I felt earlier.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Roger.   
Let's move carefully and assess the situation when we get upstairs, Arisato.

Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Arisato-kun!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Not again...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hurt - Everyone's always protecting me and getting hurt because of it.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - What am I even doing!?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Yukari-chan...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Fuuka, I need you to back me up.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - I'll hold this thing off until everyone else gets here!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - When someone gets hurt, I need to be there for them... because I have the power to help!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Wait, is this...!?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - Yukari-chan! Load the cartridge into your Evoker!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - ...I know.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Now's the time!

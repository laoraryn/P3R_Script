Pharos
Hi, it's been a while.

Pharos
Three seasons have passed since we met...
Time goes by so quickly, and in that time, many things change.
But at the same time, some things in this world will always remain the same...

Pharos
Don't you agree?

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's true.
Everything changes.
I don't know.

Pharos
I see...
If that's what you say, then it must be true.

Pharos
Hmmm...
If that's what you think, then maybe you're right.

Pharos
Happy - Hehe, I know what you mean.
Happy - No matter how hard we try, we can't predict the future.

Pharos
Talking with you has stirred up certain memories...
...Like that tower, for one.
It's been on my mind a lot lately.

Pharos
Sad - I wonder... Will our relationship stay the same?
Sad - Or, will it evolve...?
Sad - ......

Pharos
No matter what the future holds, you and I will always be friends.
...That much is certain.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
For some reason... Pharos is smiling sadly.
I sense a stronger bond with him...

Pharos
I'll see you again. But until then, good night.

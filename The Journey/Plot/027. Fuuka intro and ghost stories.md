Hey, Yuka-tan, you ever check out the student message boards and stuff?
You know how last week that girl was found by the front gate?
Well, now they're sayin' it was an angry spirit from this one ghost story that did it!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - C'mon, nobody really believes that stuff. Right...?

Mitsuru Kirijo
What's this ghost story about?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - What!?
Sad - I-It's probably made up. We don't need to go into details, do we?

Akihiko Sanada
I'm interested. Go on, tell us.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Ngh...

Junpei Iori
You got it. Here goes.

Junpei Iori
Good evening and welcome to Junpei's Believe It, or Don't.
Sad - There are many strange things in this world...
Sad - Legend has it, late at night, after everyone has gone home...
Surprised - A maniacal ghost roams the halls and devours anyone caught in its grasp!

Junpei Iori
The other day, this friend of mine—let's call him "Witness A."
Sad - Anyway, he said to me, "Hey, Iori, I saw something weird the other day."
He sounded so serious, so I asked him what he'd seen.
Sad - He told me he saw the girl from 2-E.
Sad - And claims he watched her go into the school on the night before the incident!

Junpei Iori
Happy - I told him, "I don't believe it. Not even for a second!"
That girl from 2-E ain't the type to go wanderin' around at night!
But Witness A was as white as a sheet. He swore to me it was true!
Then, it hit me.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - If the girl was found unconscious at school, then maybe the ghost really did make her its dinner!
Surprised - It all made sense! She went to the school at night, and walked right into its deadly trap!
Surprised - I felt a chill run down my spine, and I broke into a cold sweat.
Yes, there truly are some strange things in this world...
Believe it... or don't.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...What do you think, Akihiko?

Junpei Iori
Sad - Seriously? Not one word about my amazing performance just now?

Akihiko Sanada
I'm not so interested in the ghost part, but it does sound like it's worth investigating.

Junpei Iori
Happy - So you're afraid of ghosts huh, Yuka-tan? Didn't know you were such a chicken.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - What!? Who're you calling a chicken!?
Angry - Fine then. Let's investigate it.
Angry - Each of us will ask around for the rest of the week and gather information.
Angry - This ghost story is just a bunch of nonsense! I'll show you!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Sounds good to me. The story is a bit unnerving, isn't it?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Huh...?

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - We'll leave it to you guys, then.
Happy - Would've been too scary for me.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Whaaat?

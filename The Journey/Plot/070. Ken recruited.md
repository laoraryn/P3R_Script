It's me.   
Sorry for interrupting, but do you have a moment to talk?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Be right there.   
Just a minute.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Good morning.   
The chairman is visiting again tonight.   
When the time comes, let's all meet up in the command room.   
I'll see you then.

Good to see everyone's here.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
All right, come on in.   
   
Boy's Voice   
Excuse me, I hope I'm not interrupting.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Huh? Amada-kun?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - No way...   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Based on our testing results, we've confirmed he has more than enough potential.   
So, I decided to call this meeting to introduce him to the rest of the squad.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - W-Wait, Mr. Chairman, he's only in elementary school.   
Sad - And besides...   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Besides... what?   
We've already confirmed he has the potential. With training, he should be a valuable asset to the team.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Did he say he was okay with this?   
   
Ken Amada   
Actually, it was my idea to join.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - I feel like I can help too.   
Sad - And, I think I finally understand why I have this power.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
...As you can see, it was his own decision.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Looking forward to working with you. I'll try not to get in anyone's way.   
   
Aigis   
I look forward to working with you as well.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Glad to have you onboard.   
Don't push yourself, okay?   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Thank you. I'm hoping to learn a lot, Arisato-san.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
......   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Hey, don't worry, kid. We got your back.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - It might get tough, but you gotta work hard and stick with it.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Understood!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yet another new ally has joined.   
Ken Amada... He seems very level-headed   
for an elementary school student.   
As the team leader, I need   
to give him proper support.

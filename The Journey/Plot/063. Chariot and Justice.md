Fuuka Yamagishi
Hurt - Its Arcana is Justice... No, wait, it's Chariot...? Wh-What...?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - I only see one enemy, but I'm sensing two of them... I've never seen a Shadow like this before!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - No way... It split into two!?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - I see now. The turret is Justice, and the larger one is Chariot!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - The smaller one seems to have less stamina. Now we can defeat them individually.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - What...!? It revived it...!?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - It looks like both enemies can revive one another. You're going to have to defeat them at the same time.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - That tank's armor... It seems to be much harder than any Shadow so far...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - If only we could sever their link with a stronger attack...

Aigis
Surprised - I, too, request to be enhanced through fusion.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Aigis...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - They've separated again! But our damage is split equally between them!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Are you kidding me...? They fused again!?

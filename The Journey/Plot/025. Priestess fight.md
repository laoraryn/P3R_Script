Mitsuru Kirijo
Hrm...

Akihiko Sanada
You're still at it?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Yes. You never know when an enemy might appear.

Akihiko Sanada
But... I thought you couldn't scan outside of Tartarus.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - To be honest, I am indeed lacking in that area...
Maybe this is the best Penthesilea can do in terms of data-gathering.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Though I must say, the power of Persona seems to be much more diverse than I once thought.
We even have someone who can switch Personas in the midst of battle.
There's something special about his ability...
And it hasn't even been that long since his awakening.

Akihiko Sanada
Yeah, I was surprised too.
But in the end, it's up to him whether or not he reaches his full potential.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hm...?

Mitsuru Kirijo
[cut 5 4 0]

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - It's a Shadow!

Akihiko Sanada
Surprised - What!? You actually found one?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - Wait, something's not right. The reading is too big.
Angry - I've never detected an enemy of this size...

Akihiko Sanada
Surprised - Wait... Is it like that huge one from last month!?

Mitsuru Kirijo
I think so.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Well then, this is gonna be fun.
I'll wake up the others.

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Angry - We're here!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Where is it!? I'll rip it a new one!

Mitsuru Kirijo
We've detected a Shadow outside of Tartarus.
We don't know for sure, but we think it's another big one like we saw last month.

Mitsuru Kirijo
We must defeat any we find out there as quickly as possible.
People may not be aware of the Dark Hour's existence... but if the city is destroyed during that time, inconsistencies will be left behind.

Junpei Iori
Happy - In other words, we need to kick some ass, right? Well, count me in!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Junpei...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Akihiko, you stay here and wait for the chairman.

Mitsuru Kirijo
[cut 4 2 0]

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - Wha—!? Are you kidding? I'm going!

Mitsuru Kirijo
You still need time to recover. Like this, you'd only get in the way.

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - What'd you say!?

Mitsuru Kirijo
They'll fare better than you, in your current state.
Have faith in them, Akihiko. They've already seen battle firsthand.

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - ......
Sad - ...Dammit.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Relax! I've got it covered!

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - Guess I don't have a choice...
Arisato, you're in charge.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Him again...?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Can you do it?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'll do my best.
I can't...
Why me?

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Good. We're counting on you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Yes you can. You've done just fine so far, haven't you?

Junpei Iori
Who cares? They chose you, didn't they?
Y'know, same as always.

Junpei Iori
At this rate, you'll be stuck playin' leader forever...
I mean, not like I care.

Akihiko Sanada
You should let the three of them go first. You need to get ready, right?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Yes. Let's rendezvous in front of the station.

Yukari Takeba
Got it.
Angry - All right, let's go!

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Where is she?

Junpei Iori
She'll be here soon.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - There's a full moon tonight...
Sad - Looks even creepier during the Dark Hour.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - ...Huh? What the—


Mitsuru Kirijo
Sorry to keep you waiting.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Listen carefully.
Tonight, I'll be providing support from here. Everything else is the same.
The Shadow is currently located on a monorail not far from the station.
To get there, you'll have to walk on the tracks.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Uh, are you serious? Isn't that dangerous?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Not to worry. Electronic equipment is rendered inoperable during the Dark Hour—including trains.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - But, your bike...?

Mitsuru Kirijo
This was specially made to handle it.
Now, if circumstances change, I'll notify you immediately.
All right, let's get started!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Okay.

Junpei Iori
Angry - Yeah! Let's do this!

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Sad - This is it... Right?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Can you all hear me?

Yukari Takeba
Yes, loud and clear.
We just got here, but I don't see anything out of the ordinary...

Mitsuru Kirijo
The readings are definitely coming from that monorail.
Proceed with caution, and stay together.

Yukari Takeba
Got it.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Heheh, my Persona's just itchin' for a fight!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Well then, let's head on in!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - ...Don't you dare look up.

Junpei Iori
Yeah, yeah, I won't.
Happy - ......
Happy - ...But don't blame me if I happen to catch a glimpse.

Yukari Takeba
Say, Arisato-kun... Why don't we dig Junpei a nice grave?

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
Surprised - So that's, uh, a person, right? Like a passenger?
Surprised - They've been transmogged... Creepy.
Sad - But these guys aren't gonna remember a thing of all this, yeah?
Sad - Probably better that way.

Junpei Iori
[cut 2 4 1]

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Huh!?

Junpei Iori
Angry - Damn, it won't open!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - What's wrong? What happened!?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - It looks like we're trapped inside...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - It must be the Shadow... It knows you're there.
Angry - Be ready for anything! Stay on full alert!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Roger!

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Eek!

Junpei Iori
Angry - There it is!

Junpei Iori
Angry - Hey, get back here!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Wait!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - The enemy is acting strangely. I have a bad feeling about this.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - But if we don't go after it, we're gonna lose it!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Arisato, you're in command right now.
What do you think of the situation?

Minato Arisato - Selection
We should be careful.
We should go after it.
I don't know.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I agree.
It would be dangerous to chase after it blindly.

Junpei Iori
Angry - So what if it's dangerous!? We can't just stand here and let it get away!

Mitsuru Kirijo
But why did it flee after revealing itself? I can't make sense of it.
Just be careful.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I don't have any more information, either.
Just be careful.

Junpei Iori
Angry - We can beat that thing no problem!
Angry - Hell, I'll do it myself!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Junpei! Wait!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - Watch out! Behind you!

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - This is just what the enemy wants...

Mitsuru Kirijo
There's not much we can do about it now.
You have to go after him, or you'll be picked off one by one.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Dammit, Junpei! What are you thinking!?

Mitsuru Kirijo
From what I can tell, he's only a few cars ahead.

Yukari Takeba
Okay, we'll catch up to—


Yukari Takeba
Angry - Gah! Get out of our way!

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Junpei!

Junpei Iori
Angry - I've got it under control!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Arisato-kun, let's go!

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Angry - See? That's what happens when you don't listen!
Sad - Well... Are you okay?

Junpei Iori
Looking away - O-Of course I am!
Looking away - I was doin' just fine...

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Hey, what's your problem?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - Be careful, you three!
Angry - I don't detect any movement, but stay alert!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Whoa, what the—!? Why're we moving!?

Mitsuru Kirijo
It looks like the entire monorail is under the Shadow's control...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - What? Is that really okay!?

Junpei Iori
Sad - Uh... This doesn't look good.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - If we don't stop it, it's going to crash into the next train!

Mitsuru Kirijo
[cut 2 4 1]

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Crash!?
Surprised - Hey, what are we gonna do!?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Calm down and listen.
I detect a powerful reading in the front car. That must be our target.
You'll have to defeat that to stop the runaway train!

Junpei Iori
Angry - Crap! What kind of messed up ride is this!?

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
There it is!


Junpei Iori
Whoa, the hell is this...?


Junpei Iori
That's our target?


Yukari Takeba
It has to be. There's nowhere else to go!


Mitsuru Kirijo
You're approaching the other train! Hurry!


Junpei Iori
Hurry? What're we even supposed to do here!?

-----

AST_btl_gen_006_01
Hurry how!? Arrgh, we gotta take it down soon...!

AST_btl_gen_007_01
Oh man, we're in deep shit here...!

Junpei Iori
...!?


Junpei Iori
Whoa!


Junpei Iori
Sad - Did we make it in time?

Junpei Iori
[cut 3 4 1]

Junpei Iori
Surprised - ...Hey, wait! Why're we still moving!?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - We're going too fast! We need to put on the brakes, or...!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - What are you waiting for!? You're coming up on the next train, fast!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Dammit! I don't know how to stop this thing!

Minato Arisato - Selection
We have no choice!
Leave it to me!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Aaaaaah!

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
Sad - Did... Did we stop...?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I-I think so...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - Do you read me!? Is everyone all right?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Uh, y-yeah, we're okay.
Sad - Haha... M-My knees are shaking...

Junpei Iori
Angry - Dude... I'm like, drenched in sweat...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Whew... It sounds like you're safe.
Sad - I'm sorry I couldn't do more to help on my end.
Happy - I don't detect any more Shadows. Well done. You can come on back now.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Wait, how did you know which one was the brake?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I followed my instincts.
Lucky guess.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - You saved me again...
Happy - ...Thanks.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Are you shittin' me!?

Junpei Iori
Sad - Ah... Y'know what, never mind.
Sad - Anyone wanna grab a bite to eat on the way? I'm freakin' starving!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Our team survived another dangerous fight.
It feels like our trust in
each other has deepened...

[fool rank 3]

===============================================================================================

Akihiko Sanada
It's me.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Reporting in from the scene. We've just finished up over here.
The monorail did not sustain any noticeable damage.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - A job well done, Kirijo-kun.
Happy - When I heard they hijacked a monorail, I feared the worst. Excellent work taking care of that.
Happy - Now I don't have to worry about tomorrow's headlines.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - The team did a great job.
Happy - They've learned a lot in a surprisingly short time.

Akihiko Sanada
But what was up with the Shadows?
They've never done something like hijacking a train before. This is getting out of hand.

Shuji Ikutsuki
I'll be looking into the matter.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Does this mean... it's begun?

Shuji Ikutsuki
Hmm... Let's not jump to any conclusions.
For now, we should study their behavior for patterns or clues.
We can't afford to keep waiting for them to make the first move.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - If only I had more power... things wouldn't be so difficult for everyone.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Don't be so hard on yourself. You're doing fine.
More importantly...
Do you have anything to drink, Sanada-kun?

Akihiko Sanada
Surprised - Huh...?
Surprised - Why do you look so tired, Ikutsuki-san?
Surprised - Wait... Don't tell me that bicycle outside is yours!

Shuji Ikutsuki
Looking away - Boy, am I going to be sore tomorrow!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The boy from my dreams warned
me about a "hardship"...
It seems like his prediction came true.
I wonder what this could mean...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
......
I'm too exhausted to make
any sense of it right now...
I should rest as soon as
I get back to the dorm...

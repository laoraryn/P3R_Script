Happy - 'Sup, dude! How's it goin'?

Friendly Student
Happy - What, don't look at me like that!

Minato Arisato - Selection
...And you are?
What do you want?

Friendly Student
Happy - Me?

Friendly Student
Happy - Oh, come on. Lemme introduce myself, at least.

Friendly Student
Happy - Call me Junpei. Junpei Iori.

Junpei Iori
Happy - I transferred here when I was a second-year in middle school.
Happy - It's pretty tough bein' the new kid at first, y'know?
Happy - So I just wanted to say, "Hey!" See what a nice guy I am?

Yukari Takeba
......

Junpei Iori
Happy - Hey, it's Yuka-tan!
Happy - Didn't think we'd be in the same class again.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - There you go again, acting like everybody's best friend...
Exasperated* - Try not to make him uncomfortable, okay?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - What? I was just bein' friendly.

Yukari Takeba
If you say so.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Anyway, who'd have thought we'd be in the same homeroom?

Minato Arisato - Selection
1. Yeah, I know.
2. It's just a coincidence.
3. It must be fate.

===1===

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Funny, huh?

===2===

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I know, but still... I was a little surprised.

===3===

Yukari Takeba
Fate? Yeah, right.
Happy - Hehe... Still, I'm a little surprised.

===3 with low courage===

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I don't have the [courage]
to say this right now.
Maybe I could say stuff like this without
hesitation if I was at least **...

=======

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Um, hello? Are you forgetting I'm in this class too?
Happy - Anyway, I gotta ask. I heard you guys walked to school together.
Happy - What's up with that? C'mon, gimme the dirt!

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Huh!? What are you talking about?
We just happen to live in the same dorm. Why do people always jump to conclusions?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Have rumors been spreading about this already? Now I'm worried...

Yukari Takeba
Hey...
You didn't tell anyone about... you know what, did you?

Minato Arisato - Selection
1. I didn't.
2. "You know what"?

===1===

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Okay, good.

===2===

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Don't tell me you forgot already!

=======

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Seriously... Don't say anything about last night, okay?

[Junpei surprised cut-in]

Junpei Iori
Surprised - ......

Yukari Takeba
What?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Last night...?

[Junpei surprised cut-in]

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Wait a minute! Don't get the wrong idea!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Listen!
Angry - I just met him yesterday, and there's absolutely nothing between us!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Geez...
Angry - I have to go now. There's something I need to take care of for the archery team. You better not start any more rumors!

Junpei Iori
Ah, who cares? No one takes rumors seriously, anyway.
She's so paranoid...

Junpei Iori
Happy - But, hey! It's your first day here, and people are already talkin' about ya!
Happy - Believe it or not, she's actually pretty popular. You da man!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Well, here's to a fun school year, dude!

Junpei Iori
Happy - You ready to head out? We can walk to the station together.

-----

Junpei Iori
Happy - Oh, check out the jocks on their run...
Say, you thinkin' about joinin' a club?
Oh wait, new members gotta wait awhile before they can apply.

Junpei Iori
Your stop's at Iwatodai, right?
Happy - Dorms, man... Must be nice! Talk about livin' life wild and free.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Well, I'm goin' this way, so see ya tomorrow!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Ah, welcome back.
How was your first day at school?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Not too bad.
Tiring.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I see. Well, don't hesitate to ask your classmates for help if you need it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, apologies. I didn't mean to keep you here. You've had a long day, so get some rest.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - It may be overwhelming at the beginning, but you'll get used to everything in due time.

Mitsuru Kirijo
But for now, you should go back to your room and rest.

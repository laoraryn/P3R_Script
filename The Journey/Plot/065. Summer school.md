Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It's the second day of summer school...   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
I know it's hot, everyone, but let's just try and get through class. Focus pocus! Eeeheehee...   
Still, who would've thought people would actually attend this course over the summer? You sure are a curious lot.   
I'm not really sure what to make of that...   
Well, anyway, let's talk about something interesting today.   
Happy - All you future magicians will want to pay close attention... Eeeheehee...   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Today's subject is tarot. That's right, those cards often used in fortune telling.   
Despite originating in 15th-century Europe as normal playing cards, tarot cards evolved into tools of divination.   
There are a variety of tarot card decks, including the Marseille and the Rider decks...   
But today, in honor of the great Crowley, we will be using the Thoth deck.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
First, let's talk about the composition of the deck...   
The modern 78-card tarot deck is divided into two parts.   
There are 22 Major Arcana—the face cards—and 56 Minor Arcana, or number cards...   
The Minor Arcana are also sometimes called pip cards.   
The Major Arcana feature a variety of illustrations on their faces.   
Beginning with the Fool and ending with the Universe...   
They tell a story in numerical order that represents an individual's journey through life.   
Each Major Arcana represents a stage on that journey...   
And each stage represents an event an individual must experience to achieve wholeness.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
They are all important, so let's take a look at each of the 22 cards, one by one.   
The first card, numbered 0, is the Fool. It represents beginnings and suggests infinite possibilities.   
In other words, the beginning of life.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
The next card, the Magician, represents action and initiative... but also immaturity.   
The High Priestess represents contemplation and inner knowledge.   
The Empress represents both motherhood and maternal love as well as one's vitality.   
The Emperor is an opposing card. It represents fatherhood as well as leadership and decision-making skills.   
The Hierophant represents formality and knowledge. It is a symbol for religion.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
The Lovers represent choice. Here, the individual finally begins to develop a conscience.   
The Chariot represents the individual's victory, but only a momentary one.   
Justice is exactly what it sounds like: knowing what is right and what is wrong.   
The Hermit represents self-reflection. In other words, searching for answers deep within one's heart.   
Fortune represents fate, and the opportunities it brings.   
Strength represents both passion and self-control. It is depicted as power with reason.   
The Hanged Man reflects the individual's inability to take action.   
Spiritual death awaits the individual with the thirteenth card, which is aptly named Death.   
Death is considered a transitional card...   
With death, the old ends, and the new begins.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Now, let us move on to what happens following the transition.   
Temperance is the balancing of opposites. Opening one's eyes to the world allows for growth...   
And then an encounter with the Devil is where one faces temptation...   
At the Tower, the individual's values will start to collapse. It seems as if there's nothing to believe in...   
The individual then finds a glimmer of hope in the Star, granting one peace and serenity.   
In turn, this makes one vulnerable to the Moon's illusions, which gives way to fear and trepidation.   
But the individual may be rewarded with a bright future by the Sun, which signifies true achievement.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Judgement awaits the individual at the journey's end when looking back on the path one has traveled.   
The final card is the Universe, which represents the individual reaching full awareness.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
And that's the growth of an individual as explained by the tarot cards.   
Happy - Perhaps all this talk about life doesn't hit home with you young folks just yet, hm? Eeeheehee...   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Well, now you can use all 78 cards to divine the future in detail...   
...But most people only use the 22 Major Arcana.   
Okay. Next, let's talk about fortune telling using the Major Arcana.   
First, you will need to shuffle the cards.   
If a card is reversed, its meaning will change. Now, this is important, so pay attention...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Mr. Edogawa continues   
to drone on and on...   
Despite the summer heat, I manage   
to pay attention to his lecture.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It's the fifth day of summer school...   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Now, let's begin. "Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey"...   
Happy - How are you all handling the heat? I could brew you some of my special tea if you'd like... Eeeheehee...   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Now, let's continue with our special summer course, The Truth Behind Magic.   
I'll be talking about Kabbalah.   
I assume all of you have at least heard of Kabbalah, yes?   
It is known as the mystical study of the Hebrew scriptures, but...   
As I've mentioned before, it had a great impact on Western sorcery.   
It has been said that, to learn the secrets of magic, you must first understand Kabbalah.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
So, who was the person who formed this incredible ideology known as Kabbalah?   
Well, according to legend, it was Moses.   
Yes, that Moses. The Moses who gave us the Ten Commandments and split the Red Sea.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
But in reality, it was formulated by a group of rabbis long, long ago.   
However, because it features such a complicated coded system...   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Kabbalah did not become known to the Western world until much later.   
Now, it is important to note that there are many different ancient methods of deciphering Kabbalah.   
For example, there is Gematria, the interpretation of text by replacing letters with the numbers they represent.   
There is Notarikon, where you take a letter from each word to form another sentence or thought.   
There is also Temurah, a method where letters of words are replaced, thereby giving the sentence a new meaning.   
All these different methods make it difficult to fully comprehend Kabbalah.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Now, one of the most important ideas of Kabbalah is the Tree of Life, comprised of the ten Sefirot.   
Most illustrations depict it as a chart shaped like a tree.   
The ten nodes represented by the Sefirot and the 22 paths connecting them...   
All come together to form a map of God's creation and the spiritual ascent of man.   
Where did we come from? Where are we going? These answers lie in the Sefirot.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
When training your magic, it's important to picture the Sefirot every so often.   
And when you are meditating, you should focus on the Sefirot as well.   
This is going to be on the test, you know. They say knowledge is another form of magic, so study hard!   
Happy - If you find yourself struggling, well, you may wish to turn to the Sefirot... Eeeheehee...   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
By the way, did you all notice that I said there were 22 paths?   
Happy - Yes, that's right. The same number as the Major Arcana I spoke of before... Eeeheehee...   
Now, continuing on—according to Kabbalah, existence is broken up into four "worlds"...   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
Oh yes, before I forget...   
I'll be giving **supplementary lessons at the nurse's office** as of the second semester.   
I'm thinking of doing demonstrations with tarot cards.   
   
Mr. Edogawa   
But I won't have time for that during the lecture... So if you're interested, **stop by after school**.   
Happy - Everyone is welcome... Eeeheehee...

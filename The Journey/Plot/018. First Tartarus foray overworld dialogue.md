Mitsuru Kirijo   
This is the first real battle for Takeba and Iori. Proceed with caution.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Aw yeah! How'd you like my Persona ability!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Yeah, yeah, that was amazing.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Well done, Iori. Considering it was your first battle, you did well.   
Takeba, too. You'll be fine. Don't be afraid to show what you can do.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Got it.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Another Shadow up ahead. Let's get you more accustomed to combat.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - The battle's about to begin! Everyone, stay focused!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Whoa, I did it...!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Fantastic work, Takeba! You performed as well as I hoped you would.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Totally! I couldn't take my eyes off you!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Can you try not being a creep...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Great, looks like everyone's gotten used to handling their Personas.   
Leader, take note of each member's strengths and conduct the battle accordingly.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I can still sense some enemies around. Let's move on.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - How'd ya like our all-out combo attack, ya filthy Shadows!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - When I saw my opening, it's like my body just knew what to do.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - That was magnificent teamwork. It's hard to believe it's your first time.   
As you grasp the flow of battle, you'll learn to coordinate with each other seamlessly.   
Let's apply what we've learned so far and continue exploring.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The enemy has been defeated. Excellent work.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Um... Was that...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Well, it looks like he has the ability to summon different Personas.   
Happy - I suspected as much after the events from the other day, but now we know for sure.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Look, that treasure chest looks different from the one before.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yes, that particular box is sealed in a special way.   
The box can be unlocked by its own mechanism, but it needs something else to work during the Dark Hour...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The **Twilight Fragment** I found in my   
room seems to be reacting...   
   
Junpei Iori   
What's that ya got there...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Interesting, you had one on you... Good, then try using it.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - It's what I handed to you. Try using it.   
   
-----   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Approach carefully to avoid being spotted.   
Make sure to keep an eye on the map as you explore and be on high alert to your surroundings.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - That enemy is acting kind of weird... Please consider turning back!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh, an enemy!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - But there's something odd about the way it's acting... Please turn back for now!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Move in and hit it before it attacks you!   
   
MSG_001_0_0   
Press  to use your weapon.   
If you can hit an enemy before it hits you, then you'll have the advantage at the start of the battle.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If you get attacked by the enemy, the battle will begin at a disadvantage to you.   
Try and make certain that you strike the enemy first to guarantee the initiative in battles.   
   
MSG_001_0_0   
If you are able to strike the enemy before you are spotted, then you will gain the initiative.   
On the other hand, if the enemy hits you first, the opposite will occur.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
How are you feeling?   
If you or another party member is in bad shape, then recover using healing skills or items.   
It'd be wise to make a habit of checking everyone's status before entering battles.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Press the  button to open the menu. From there, you can recover HP with skills and items.   
You can use your allies' skills from there as well, so feel free to do so, but keep an eye on their SP.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Our only means of moving up to the next floor is to use stairs like these.   
I can't allow you to do so today, but you should remember about it for next time.

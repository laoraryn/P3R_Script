Pharos
Good morning.

Pharos
This is the first time we've talked during the day.

Pharos
Happy - Isn't this weather lovely? This really is the start of a new day.
...For both of us.

Pharos
All the fragments of my memory are finally back together.
I understand my purpose now.

Pharos
The time has come.
Sad - I know this is going to hurt, but there's something I have to tell you.

Pharos
This is goodbye... for you and me.
In my eyes, our friendship was a miracle. I want you to know that.

Pharos
But even miracles don't last forever.
Sad - If only they did.

Minato Arisato - Selection
I guess that's true.
Nothing can last forever.
It doesn't matter.

Pharos
Sad - Maybe you're right.
Even if eternity does exist, how would we ever know?
It'd be no different than if it didn't exist.

Pharos
You're right.
What's most important is the experience.

Pharos
Happy - I'll always treasure the time we had together.
Happy - Today may be the end, but the bond between us can never be severed.

Pharos
Remember that.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Pharos is looking at me with teary eyes...
I sense a strong bond
between Pharos and me...

Pharos
Happy - It was fun while it lasted.
Happy - So long.

Shinjiro Aragaki

Server
Coming right up!
One house special!

Akihiko Sanada
Don't you get sick of eating the same thing all the time?

Shinjiro Aragaki
Shut up.
You're the one always eating that protein shit.

Akihiko Sanada
Hmph.

Server
Here you go, one house special! Be careful, it's hot!

Shinjiro Aragaki

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - Think about it, Shinji. Don't let your power go to waste.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Exasperated* - My power ain't worth shit.

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - Shinji!

Shinjiro Aragaki
I made up my mind a long time ago. I ain't goin' back.

Akihiko Sanada
You have to let the past go.
What's done is done. It's time you moved on.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Hmph... You should talk.

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - What?

Shinjiro Aragaki
Face it.
You're no different than me.

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - Ah... Hey! Shinji!
Sad - ......

Akihiko Sanada
I thought you were gonna go visit your mother's grave.

Ken Amada
Sanada-san...

Akihiko Sanada
You sure this is where you wanna be?

Ken Amada
Well, I was planning on visiting her.
Sad - But when I thought about what I was gonna say to her, it just didn't feel right.
Sad - I've still got unfinished business to take care of first.

Akihiko Sanada
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I don't have anything to tell Shinji right now.
Sad - I've got my own stuff to deal with.

Ken Amada
An unbeatable enemy, huh... I wonder what it's like.

Akihiko Sanada
Beats me.
It doesn't matter, though. I've already made up my mind.
I don't care what I'm up against. I'm gonna look it straight in the eyes.

Ken Amada
Straight in the eyes...
Happy - I like the sound of that. You can count me in, too!

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - All right.

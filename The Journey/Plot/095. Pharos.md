Pharos   
Good evening.   
   
Pharos   
It'll be a full moon again in just another week.   
Finally, this will be the twelfth ordeal.   
Are you ready?   
   
Pharos   
Happy - I can't tell if time's been at a crawl or flying on by, but either way, a lot's happened, hasn't it?   
Happy - It's a bit soon to be reminiscing, though.   
   
Pharos   
Happy - How about I come see you once it's over?   
Happy - ...Be careful now.

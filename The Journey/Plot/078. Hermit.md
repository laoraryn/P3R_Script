Shinjiro Aragaki   
Exasperated* - So this is one of those huge Shadows, huh. Well, not like it changes what we usually do...   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - I'll help, too...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - This large Shadow's Arcana is the Hermit. Watch out for attacks that use electricity!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - The enemy Shadow is charging a lot of electricity inside its body!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - It might be up to something. I'll analyze it on my end as well!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - I've got it. The enemy gets stronger by absorbing electrical power.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - But, it seems the enemy's defense drops temporarily while it's charging up...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - To stop the enemy from powering up, you'll need to attack while it's charging!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - The enemy Shadow is charging up now!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - We've stopped the enemy from powering up!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - The enemy is stronger than before! Everyone, be careful!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - This is different from how it's been charging up till now...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - Is it sucking electricity from the entire city...!? If it absorbs all that power, we'll be in trouble!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - If we attack it now, we can stop it from powering up!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - I sense an enormous amount of energy from the enemy!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - It's powered up significantly. Everyone, hang in there!

Hurt - Ungh...

Pale Young Man
You seem to be in great pain.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Hurt - You again...

Punk
Oh shit, it's them.

Tough Chick
You mean those three? Ugh, they're freaky!

Punk
Shut up! Let's get out of here!

Pale Young Man
Why do they always run and hide at the sight of me?

Pale Young Man
They're like back alley rats.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Beats me.

Pale Young Man
Jin. Give him the capsules.

Intelligent Boy
......

Shinjiro Aragaki
Thanks.
I'll pay you the usual way.

Intelligent Boy
Now, hold up.

Pale Young Man
This time, we'd like your payment in the form of information.

Pale Young Man
Your acquaintances have been busy lately.
I'm referring to their activities on nights when the moon is full, of course.
They've spent a great deal of time in the tower as well. I wonder, why did they take this burden upon themselves?

Shinjiro Aragaki
......

Pale Young Man
Happy - You do know, don't you? But you don't wish to say...
Happy - Is it perhaps because... you're one of them?

Shinjiro Aragaki
Angry - I'm not! I've got nothing to do with them anymore.

Pale Young Man
Then tell us.
I'm sure you'd agree these pills are more important than a group you have nothing to do with.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Tch...

Shinjiro Aragaki
I don't know the details, but...
Supposedly, destroying all those creatures will put an end to the Dark Hour, and that weird-ass tower will disappear.
That's all I know, alright?

Pale Young Man
You mean... they intend to eliminate the Dark Hour completely?

Pale Young Man
Surprised - Why would they do such a thing!? To give up such power...

Shinjiro Aragaki
Uh...

Pale Young Man
To destroy the Tower of Demise!?

Shinjiro Aragaki
"Tower of Demise"...?
Who wouldn't wanna take out that damn thing?

Intelligent Boy
Angry - Takaya...

Pale Young Man
...Yes, I know.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Hmph. I can't go back.
I won't use my power again. Not after last time...

Shuji Ikutsuki
How is he?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Looks like he's a little worn out. He went to bed without changing out of his uniform.
Other than that, nothing has changed since last night.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...The same as last night.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Hmm... Very interesting.
Even those who have the potential tend to be unstable at first.
Memory loss... Disorientation...

Shuji Ikutsuki
This subject is rather unique. He hasn't exhibited any of the common symptoms.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - But... we're treating him like a guinea pig.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Oh, don't look at it like that. The two of you are classmates, right?
Consider it an opportunity to have someone your own age here.
Besides, we need all the help we can get.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I guess that's true. But still...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Command room speaking.
...Akihiko? What's wrong?

Akihiko Sanada
You're not gonna believe it! This thing is huge!
Unfortunately, it's chasing after me right now...
I'm almost back. Just letting you know in advance.

Akihiko Sanada

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Does that mean... he's bringing that thing here!?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - Mr. Chairman!
Angry - That's enough observation for now. We need to prepare for combat!

Shuji Ikutsuki
Surprised - ...R-Right! Be careful!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - Akihiko!

Akihiko Sanada
Hurt - Agh...!

Akihiko Sanada
I'm all right.
Happy - Get ready to be surprised... It'll be here any second.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - This is no time to joke around!

Shuji Ikutsuki
Is it one of them, Sanada-kun?

Akihiko Sanada
Yeah, but not an ordinary one...

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Ahh!
Surprised - What was that!? You've gotta be kidding me!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Mr. Chairman, please head for the command room!
Takeba, go upstairs and wake him up! Then, escape out the back.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - But what about you two?

Mitsuru Kirijo
We'll stop it here.
You're the one who led it to us, Akihiko, so I'm going to have you fight.

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - It's not like I asked it to follow me!
Angry - What are you waiting for, Takeba? Go!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - O-Okay!

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
A loud noise woke me up...
I should check what's happening outside...

Yukari Takeba
Wake up!

Yukari Takeba
Sorry, but I'm coming in!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - There's no time to explain. We have to get out of here, now!

Minato Arisato - Selection
What's going on?
All right.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Hurry! To the first floor! We'll leave through the back!

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Oh, wait!
Take this, just in case.

DEV: Internal MES - MND_008_0_0

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Okay... Let's go!

-----

Yukari Takeba
Sad - All right, we should be safe now—

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - Takeba, do you read me!?

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Y-Yes! I hear you!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - Be careful! There appears to be more than one enemy!
Angry - The primary one's lurking somewhere nearby!

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - What!?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Wh-Whoa! Let's pull back!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - What are we going to do? It's at the front door...
Sad - Should we go upstairs for now?

-----

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - What was that!?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Don't tell me it got inside!

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - It's getting closer!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Keep moving! Hurry!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Right! If we go out through here, then...!

-----

Yukari Takeba
Whew...

Yukari Takeba
I've locked the door, so we should be safe for now.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Huh!?

-----

Yukari Takeba
No way...


Yukari Takeba
That's it. One of the monsters that attacked us...


Yukari Takeba
It's a Shadow!


Akihiko Sanada
It's here!


Shuji Ikutsuki
Wait.


Mysterious Boy
...Go on.


Mysterious Boy
Per...


Mysterious Boy
so...

Mysterious Boy
na...

Mysterious Boy
Na...

Orpheus
I am thou... Thou art I...


Orpheus
From the sea of thy soul, I cometh.


Orpheus
I am Orpheus, master of strings...


Mitsuru Kirijo
Just as we thought...


Mitsuru Kirijo
Ngh... Aaaaaaaaaah!

[Mitsuru surprised cut-in] 

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - ...!

Akihiko Sanada
Surprised - What on earth was that...!?

Shuji Ikutsuki
Surprised - ......

-----

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Is it over...?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Eek!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - No... G-Get away from me!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I need to protect her...!

-----

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The monsters are gone...
......

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Ah!

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Are you okay!?
Surprised - Come on...!

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Can you hear me!?
Surprised - Say something...!

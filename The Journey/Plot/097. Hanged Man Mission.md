Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - I found it. It's at the south end of the Moonlight Bridge.   
Surprised - The twelfth and final Shadow...   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Mmm, so this is it...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - And as we expected, I'm detecting more Persona-users nearby...   
Sad - It's Strega.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
They know this is their last chance. We expected as much, but don't be careless.   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - So it's them...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Scheming - Heh. Saves us the trouble of looking for them.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You've all fought admirably thus far.   
This will be our last operation. Let's all come back safely.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Got it.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Scheming - Roger that.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Of course.   
   
DEV: Internal MES - MND_010_0_0   
The final battle is here...   
The last Shadow and Strega await us.   
This is serious. I should choose   
my team lineup carefully...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The final battle is here at last...   
But first, there are two powerful   
adversaries we have to confront.   
At the south end of the Moonlight Bridge...   
   
Takaya   
......   
   
Takaya   
I trust you know what is at stake today?   
You claim you hunt the Shadows to prevent the disaster they bring...   
Yet, countless lives are lost each day, even without their intervention.   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - ......   
   
Takaya   
The ability to use a Persona is not in itself evil... You have no reason to forsake it.   
So, why not just admit it? You do not truly wish to eliminate the Dark Hour...   
You are merely deceiving yourselves in the pursuit of self-satisfaction...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You're wrong.   
Maybe so.   
Who cares?   
   
Takaya   
I don't think you truly believe that.   
   
Takaya   
Who cares?   
Refusing to answer is akin to turning your back on the truth.   
   
Takaya   
You are foolish children indeed...   
Erasing the Dark Hour is the same as erasing yourselves.   
   
Takaya   
How can you not even conceive such a thought? Your imprudence is truly beyond comprehension.   
As I believed, our goals are irreconcilable.   
   
Takaya   
It's time, Jin.   
   
Jin   
What a buncha fools. I can't stand to look at ya.   
   
Takaya   
Fate shall decide which of us will remain.   
   
Takaya   
Happy - ...Come then.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Jin   
Sad - Ngh... We still lost...   
Sad - So, us experiments can't even stand up to a naturally awakened Persona...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Experiments...?   
   
Jin   
Hurt - For us, it's not so simple... Our powers weren't awakened naturally. We can't even use 'em without straining our bodies.   
Hurt - Don't you remember what your dead pal was carrying...?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - So, you were giving Shinji the suppressants...   
   
Jin   
Angry - You guys don't have the slightest clue what'll happen if the Dark Hour disappears... do you?   
   
Jin   
Angry - It won't matter for normal people, since they don't remember anything anyway...   
Angry - But without the Dark Hour, even Persona-users like us will—   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...?   
   
Takaya   
Hurt - Jin... That's enough.   
Hurt - Now then... Ordinarily, we would withdraw here...   
   
Takaya   
Hurt - But that is not an option tonight.   
Hurt - This body, ephemeral though it may be... is worthless without my power.   
   
Takaya   
Therefore, I've only one choice... I shall prove my existence here and now!   
   
Jin   
Angry - ...!   
   
Takaya   
Angry - ...!? What are you doing!?   
   
Jin   
Angry - Don't be so reckless!   
   
Takaya   
Angry - Jin!?   
   
Jin   
Sad - ...Sorry.   
Sad - But... I haven't forgotten what you said to me.   
   
Jin   
You win... Go on and defeat the Shadow.   
Maybe then you'll see what you've been fightin' for this whole time.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Wait a sec!   
Surprised - Don't tell me you're gonna jump...!   
   
Jin   
Angry - I'd rather die than surrender to you!   
   
Jin   
[cut 212 10 1]   
   
Jin   
Angry - Take a good look! This is how we live!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - They jumped...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - What the hell...?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Don't let it get to you. They chose how they wanted to go out.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...We're not done here yet.   
Our real target is waiting... Let's just focus on that for now.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - This is the final battle...   
Angry - I'll do everything I can to support you. Just please be careful out there!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
......   
   
Junpei Iori   
Is it... over?   
   
Aigis   
The operation is over. Or should I say, "Mission complete."   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yes... It's finally over.   
   
Aigis   
Minato-san.   
I believe a celebration is in order.   
What will be our victory cheer?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Hip hip hooray!   
Let's eat!   
   
Aigis   
One... Two... Three... Hip hip hooray!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Hip... hip hooray...?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Hip hip hooray!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Hip hip hooray!   
   
Aigis   
One... Two... Three... Let's eat!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Let's... eat?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Haha! What was that!?   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - Huh. I wonder if Aigis-san can even get hungry...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Sooo, Kirijo-senpai... You're gonna help us with the victory party tomorrow, right?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - You certainly don't waste any time. Well, I do suppose we've earned it.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Well, in that case, how 'bout sushi!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Sushi, huh... It has been a while.   
Happy - Well, I've got dibs on the halibut and sea urchin!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Oh, uh, then I call the fatty tuna!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - O-Oh, we're divvying it up already? Um, can I get the salmon roe then?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Hey, wait a minute... You can't do that!   
   
Aigis   
I reserve the fatty tuna, bluefin, shrimp, squid, scallops... and sea eel.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Hey! That's not fair! You don't even eat!   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - How immature, fighting over sushi...   
   
Koromaru   
Woof!   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Mitsuru-san, please order tamago for me. They say you can tell a chef's skill by how he prepares eggs.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - A chef's skill? Geez, how old are you again?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Okay, okay. I'll have the very best delivered tomorrow.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - You mean it!? Aw man, I'm so glad I'm still alive!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Junpei, you can have the leftover dried gourd roll.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - What!? But it was my idea in the first place!   
   
（ＳＥ）伊織 順平   
くうう～！   
   
   
（ＳＥ）岳羽 ゆかり   
あはははっ！   
   
（ＳＥ）山岸 風花   
ふふふっ！   
   
   
（ＳＥ）真田 明彦   
ははは…   
   
（ＳＥ）桐条 美鶴   
フフッ…   
   
（ＳＥ）天田 乾   
へへっ…   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...I guess it's time to say goodbye to the Dark Hour.   
Even though it seemed like a curse, for some reason I feel sad to see it go.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We really did it, didn't we...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yes.   
We've saved the world, even if no one knows it.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...Yeah.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
......   
The battle has ended.   
The Dark Hour has come to an end...

Mysterious Boy   
You've prevailed yet again.   
   
Mysterious Boy   
Do you remember what I said before?   
About everything coming to an end?   
Well, I recalled something else.   
   
Mysterious Boy   
I'm pretty sure the end is unavoidable.   
   
Mysterious Boy   
But it's kind of weird.   
It doesn't feel that inevitable right now, considering the vast potential inside you.   
Plus, it seems like your power's changed quite a bit.   
   
Mysterious Boy   
Happy - Hey, if you don't mind, can I be your friend?   
Happy - I'm really curious about you. What do you say?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Fine by me.   
Sure, what's your name?   
Yeah, whatever.   
   
Mysterious Boy   
Okay. Then as of right now, we're friends.   
   
Mysterious Boy   
Name...?   
Oh, I see. I need a name.   
   
Mysterious Boy   
Hehe, guess you don't really care. Maybe I didn't need to bring it up, hm?   
You and I have been together since the beginning.   
   
Mysterious Boy   
My name is... Pharos.   
   
Pharos   
Happy - I know we'll get along great.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I can feel the beginnings of a bond   
with the mysterious boy, Pharos...   
   
Pharos   
Well, it's getting late, so I'm going now.   
Happy - I can hardly wait until the next time we meet.   
Happy - Bye-bye.

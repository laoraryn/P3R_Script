Someone's Voice
It is morning!
I request that you wake up.

Aigis
You have successfully awakened. Mission complete.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Why are you here?
Mission complete?
My alarm clock...

Aigis
My highest priority is to be at your side.

Aigis
"Five minutes early is on time."
That is the phrase posted on the wall, so I woke you five minutes before your alarm clock engages.

Aigis
It has not triggered yet.

Yukari's Voice
Hey, are you awake?
That girl disappeared, and we can't find her anywhere. Can you help us?
She might've gone out on her own, like she did in Yakushima.

Aigis
My name is not "that girl." Please address me as "Aigis."

Yukari's Voice
Huh?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Aigis!? When did you—


Aigis
I entered while he was asleep. Unlocking the door took two minutes.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - That's unlawful entry!
Angry - Didn't we tell you to stay in the command room at night!?

Aigis
I determined that it is ideal to be on standby in this room. Is this a problem?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - What...? Where is this coming from all of a sudden?

Aigis
If there is a problem, I will address it promptly.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Uh, the problem... W-Well, it's probably against dorm regulations, for one...

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Look, don't just stand there! Tell her!

Minato Arisato - Selection
You can't stay here.
You can stay here.
I don't care.

Yukari Takeba
See? He agrees.

Aigis
...I will comply.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Oh, come on! You know she's not allowed in here!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Well, you should care! She's not allowed in here!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Okay, look.
Sad - I'll get a room set up for you on the third floor, so you can stay nearby.

Yukari Takeba
Just don't leave the dorm by yourself, okay?

Aigis
I will do as commanded.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Yeah, okay. I'm tired.

Yukari Takeba
All right, well, I have practice this morning, so I gotta get to school.

Aigis
Everyone here goes to a place called "school" in the morning.

Aigis
I comprehend.

Sad - Hm...

Chidori
Sad - What am I drawing?
Sad - Why this?

Chidori
Surprised - What?

Chidori
Surprised - ...!?

Intruder
It's been a while.

Chidori
That voice...

Takaya
Happy - I'm glad to see you once again.

Takaya
Jin, the instruments, if you would.

Jin
Here.

Jin
Sad - Don't tell me you can't even recognize your own Evoker.

Chidori
Surprised - Ah!

Takaya
Happy - Now there's nothing in the world keeping you here, yes?

Chidori
Sad - Takaya...

Takaya
Surely you understand.
There is nowhere for you to go. Your only choice is to come with us.
You know all too well that death is not to be feared.

Takaya
Hurt - You need only fear—


Chidori
I know, Takaya.

Takaya
Happy - ...Excellent.

Chidori
Angry - It's all his fault...
Angry - Ever since he started getting too close, I've suffered every single day.
Angry - And now I'm afraid to die.

Jin
Hey, Chidori, hurry it up.

Chidori
Sad - ......
Angry - Medea, let's go.

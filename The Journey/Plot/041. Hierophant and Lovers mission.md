Akihiko Sanada
Any luck, Fuuka?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - Just a moment...
Very angry* - I found it! I'm picking up a large Shadow in the city!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Hey, we were right!

Shuji Ikutsuki
Surprised - Yes, it seems like our full moon hypothesis was correct.

Fuuka Yamagishi
It's located in Iwatodai, inside a building on Shirakawa Boulevard.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Hmm, Shirakawa Boulevard...
They've been finding the Lost in pairs lately. Now I understand why.

Mitsuru Kirijo
In pairs?
Ah!
Now I understand.

Fuuka Yamagishi
What's on Shirakawa Boulevard? I'm not familiar with that area.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - I've heard about it, but...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Oh, that's where all those hotels are. That explains a lot!
Happy - You've heard about 'em, right Fuuka? Where people go to... y'know...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Wh-What?

Yukari Takeba
Angry - What is wrong with you...?

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Come now, don't let your imaginations get carried away. They're no different from any other hotel.
Happy - The rooms are just a bit more... exotic, that's all.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Oh, really?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I don't know about this. Maybe I shouldn't go.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Aw, look at you, Yuka-tan. You're such a child sometimes.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - What? Who're you calling a child!?
Angry - All right, fine. Let's go.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - I'm reserving a spot in the lineup for today's operation. No objections!

Junpei Iori
Sad - Y-You can just do that?

Yukari Takeba
So, who's gonna take the lead?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Arisato.
I don't see any reason to change leaders now.

Minato Arisato - Selection
All right.
Fine...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Yamagishi, I want you to handle support during the operation.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'll do my best!

Akihiko Sanada
All right, go ahead and decide on the rest of the team. Let's do this.

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Whoa! Looks just like I imagined.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Champs... Dee... Floors...? How d'you say that?

Mitsuru Kirijo
It's "Champs De Fleur."
It means field of flowers.

Fuuka Yamagishi
This is the place. I can sense the presence inside.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Then c'mon, Leader. Let's get this over with!

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Angry - This thing's the boss? Huh. It's more normal-looking than I expected.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - Get ready, everyone! Here it comes!

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
\[humming\]

Yukari Takeba
Huh...?

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Where am I...?
My head feels foggy...
I can't remember why I'm here...

Minato Arisato - Selection
What was I doing...?
I guess it doesn't matter...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I feel like I'm forgetting
something important...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
...?
I can hear the shower
running in the bathroom...

Voice in Your Head
Embrace your desire...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
There's a strange voice
ringing inside my head...

Voice in Your Head
I am the voice of your inner self...
Revel in the moment...
That which cannot be felt is merely a dream... The present is all we have.

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's right...
That's not true...
Who cares...?

Voice in Your Head
The future is but a fantasy, memory a fabrication...
Let your desire free you from your shackles... Such is your wish...

Minato Arisato - Selection
I can't give in...
Maybe so...
I don't understand...

Voice in Your Head
Pleasure is what you truly seek.
You stand before the doorway to bliss.
You cannot deny your instincts... Embrace your desire...

Minato Arisato - Selection
I don't really get it...
I'm listening...
I'll pass...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
My consciousness is starting to blur...
But I know I still have work to do...

Voice in Your Head
Why do you resist...? Do not avert your eyes from the truth...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
My mind is getting clearer.
Seems like something was trying
to manipulate my thoughts...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Someone turned off the
shower in the bathroom...

Yukari Takeba
Uh... What was I...?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Huh?


Yukari Takeba

Yukari Takeba
Very angry* - Eeeek!


Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It seems like Yukari's thoughts
were being manipulated as well...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Ah, I can finally reach you!
Surprised - Can you two hear me?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I hear you.
What's going on?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - I'm sorry I couldn't contact you sooner.
Sad - The Shadow was interfering with your thoughts, so I couldn't reach you.
Sad - Looks like you two got teleported away as well. The group's all been separated.
Sad - The enemy is still in the same room. Let's regroup and then head back there.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Did you hear that, Yukari-chan?

Yukari Takeba
Yeah. I heard you.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Um, did something happen?

Yukari Takeba
It's fine!

Yukari Takeba
Come on, let's go.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - And how about we don't mention this to anyone... got it?

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Angry - So it was you!
Angry - I'll teach you not to mess with a girl's heart!

Fuuka Yamagishi
We'll get it this time! I believe in you, team!

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'm glad you're all safe.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Excellent work. The enemy was clever, but you came out on top.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Thank you.

Akihiko Sanada
You did good too, Takeba. It's no wonder you volunteered.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Uh, yeah. Right...

Mitsuru Kirijo
And you as well, Arisato.
You were able to remain calm during the enemy's mental assault.

Akihiko Sanada
Maybe you're finally starting to recognize yourself as a leader. Keep up the good work.

Junpei Iori
Looking away - ......

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Our team survived another dangerous fight.
It feels like the level of trust
between us all has grown...

Akihiko Sanada
All right, let's call it a night.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, Yukari-chan.
Um, about that thing you mentioned the other day...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - You found something?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Y-Yes.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Okay, tell me about it later.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - All right! We should head back, too.

Yukari Takeba
Hey, come on, Junpei. Let's go.
Happy - Fuuka played a big role in this one again. Seems like the second-years are really putting in the work!

Junpei Iori
Sad - Looks like you're really shining out there, Minato.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Minato... So, you're the hero again, huh?

Minato Arisato - Selection
It was just luck.
We all did our part.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Yeah, right. You know it's not.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Really, now.
Sad - Well, whatever, I guess.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Don't tell me you're jealous someone else is getting all the attention.

Yukari Takeba
[cut 3 2 0]

Junpei Iori
Angry - Shut up!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - What's his problem?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
......
We successfully defeated the
Shadows this month, too.
There should be fewer victims for a while.
But I'm too exhausted to
think about all that right now.
I should hurry back to the
dorm and get some rest...

===============================================================================================

Pale Young Man
That was faster than I expected.

Girl in a Dress
......

Pale Young Man
Happy - Quite a show, I must admit.
Happy - They've been rather busy these last few months, haven't they?

Pale Young Man
Happy - And it seems they've gained new recruits, too. Their fighting style is most fascinating.
Happy - Not to mention they've made several forays into the tower...

Pale Young Man
Well, Jin? Are they our enemy?

Intelligent Boy
How 'bout we go ask our "buddy"? Gonna be seein' him real soon.

Pale Young Man
Happy - Ah, yes. An excellent idea.
Considering that he shares our fate, it would be prudent to seek his opinion.
Hurt - After all, we don't have much time left...

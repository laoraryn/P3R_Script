So, Tartarus and the Dark Hour are on the way out, huh.
Angry - Tch!

Junpei Iori
Angry - No, that's a good thing. That's what we've been fighting for.
Looking away - So then, why...?

Junpei Iori
Angry - Dammit! Why am I so pissed!?

Listless Student
Gosh, it's hot. Even for July.

Expressive Student
Wow, can't believe we're already third-years.
Guess this'll be the last time we'll wear these uniforms and hang out after school.

Listless Student
Ugh, who cares. I just wanna get into college and start having fun already.

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - Haha... I get it.
Exasperated* - My problem is me.
Looking away - Been goin' on like fighting was my duty and all. But actually... it's just all I'm good at.

Junpei Iori
Looking away - 'Cause without that...
Looking away - Without that, I'm nothing.
Exasperated* - Hah. So much for bein' a hero.
Looking away - I can't fight worth a shit anyway. Not compared to him at least.

Junpei Iori
Looking away - Ugh...

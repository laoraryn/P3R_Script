Mitsuru Kirijo   
Welcome back. With that, we have all the second-years present.   
   
Junpei Iori   
So... what exactly are we all here for?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Ah, I had planned to give Yamagishi a tour of the dorm...   
But I realized I never actually showed it properly to any of you since you moved in.   
I apologize for that. I'd like to take this opportunity to make it up to you all.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sounds good.   
A little late for that.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Uh, we've kinda been living here all this time... I think we get the picture by now.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - If any one of us needs it, it's you.   
You do realize if you screw around and break something, you'll get us all in trouble, right?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - It couldn't hurt to do it anyway, just in case.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - You never know if a certain someone might screw around blind and break something in here.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Oh c'mon, I'm getting by just fine! In fact, I know the place so well I could give you a tour myself!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Heh... You'll make a great assistant, then.   
Humor me a bit, won't you? With the increase in members, I'd like to expand our access to facilities.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Wait, new stuff? Sweet!   
Happy - So what, are we gonna get like... hot springs? Or maybe a casino!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - You are so stupid...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - We'll just have to see, now won't we?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
With that, let's begin. Yamagishi, follow me.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, okay! Thank you for setting this up for me.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
This is the communal kitchen.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Whoa, it looks so clean now! I didn't realize the kitchen was so big...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I was planning to do this earlier, but with April's Shadow attack and ensuing investigation, I just couldn't find time.   
It should be far more accessible now. You're free to use any of the kitchenware here.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Do you all cook your own meals?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I've seen Akihiko in here from time to time. As for myself, I can't say I do.   
Sad - We used to have someone who cooked with some frequency, but...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Come to think of it, I only ever come here to get hot water. What about you?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I don't cook.   
I'd like to try it.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I guess if you're only cooking for one, it doesn't really save that much money anyway.   
It's hard to use up everything you buy before it goes bad. Might as well just eat out at that point.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
If you care about eating a balanced diet, there's no better way than to cook it yourself.   
But it's not as cheap as they make it out to be. It's hard to use everything up before it goes bad.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Wow, Yukari-chan... Does that mean you know how to cook?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Huh? Oh, I mean... I can do it, I guess, but I'm no chef!   
It's been a while, and I've had my fair share of embarrassments.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - But with a kitchen this big, I think a couple people could work together in here.   
Happy - We can halve the work, but double the flavor, you know? I should try it next time.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
If I invite someone to cook, we could   
use this kitchen to make something...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Moving right along, then...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Here's where we all hang!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
This is the lounge... Well, I suppose it requires no further explanation.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Wait... Is that a DVD player!? When did that get here?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, that's mine.   
I brought it with me from home. It's a bit of an old model, though...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Thanks.   
You don't mind keeping it here?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It's no problem at all. It was a broken one to begin with...   
But I was able to fix it, so I hoped you all might get some use out of it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
If I took it to my room, I'd be watching alone on my laptop. I hoped you all might make better use of it.   
Happy - And besides, I like the colors more when I watch on a CRT.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - The sofas here are pretty comfy. It'd be a perfect place to sit back and watch.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Oh, maybe this would be a good place...   
Sad - There are some movies I've been wanting to see, but... I'd rather not watch them alone...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - What's this? Is Yuka-tan afraid to watch horror flicks?   
Happy - It's quite a shocker to see your soft side... Hard to imagine you're even the same person.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - And what exactly is that supposed to mean?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Uh... Wait, what did I say? I take it back! I didn't mean anything by it, I swear!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - You've got some nerve, Junpei.   
Angry - You'd better watch your back next time we go to Tartarus.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - Um, Yukari-chan? You're kind of scaring me...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I could probably watch a   
DVD with someone here...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That wraps up the first floor. Let's move up to the next.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, by the way, Kirijo-senpai...   
Are we allowed to borrow those books on the shelf in the back?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Of course.   
Those books were donated by residents of the dorm. I peruse them from time to time myself.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - This area's pretty sweet. Nice and quiet, and lemme tell ya, those chairs are soft.   
Happy - When I cozy up here with a good book, I end up reading way late into the night.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - All you read is manga...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Hehe, I think manga is a respectable form of literature. Maybe I'll try reading here as well...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - People are always coming and going from the lounge, so I could see this place being less distracting.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I think I'd be able to focus   
and read a book here...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Please, utilize it however you'd like. Any piece of literature is a means of broadening one's horizons.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Aye-aye, Captain!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Just one thing, Iori...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
When you finish a manga, put it back on the shelf. I don't want to see them piled up on tables and chairs.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Aye-aye...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Geez... Arisato-kun, keep an eye on Junpei so he doesn't make a mess of this place.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Let's keep moving on, then.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We'd been keeping the rooftop off-limits, but recently decided to open it up.   
The chairman wanted to start a small garden here.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Wow... I had no idea there was something like this up here. Is it for growing vegetables?   
Exasperated* - Oh boy, I can hear him now... "Eat your veggies, peas!"   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Thaaat sounds about right... With a terrible smirk plastered on his face.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I hear you're the one taking care of it, Arisato.   
Happy - Looks like it's shaping up quite nicely. The chairman was right to put you in charge.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I've been told it was left in your care, Arisato.   
I know it sounds like a lot of work, but it might be nice to try growing a thing or two.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Uh, are you okay doin' this all on your own?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's no problem.   
I could use some help.   
You're in charge now.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oh yeah? You like this kinda stuff? Gotta admit, looks kinda fun.   
Happy - Maybe we'll be rakin' in the harvest after a while. When that time comes... "lettuce" celebrate!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - ...Why don't you use that energy to help him with the garden?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Why don't you help him out, Junpei? It's not like you've got anything better to do.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Yeah, definitely saw that one coming... But I guess it does look kinda fun.   
Happy - Maybe all the vitamins from the veggies will make my skin all silky smooth.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - Hehe... That would be a sight to see.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - What, me!? No no, bad idea.   
Sad - I tried to grow morning glories for a project in elementary school... Not a single one lived.   
But hey, maybe this is my chance to give it another shot. I can help out from time to time, I guess...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - The more time and care you put into this kind of work, the better the results.   
Happy - Cooperating with someone on this may be worth your time.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I might be a bit interested as well...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Having someone help me with the   
garden might affect the end result...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That wraps up this area. Let's head back down.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
And that concludes the tour.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Being shown around kinda makes me feel more motivated to make use of those places.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Arisato, did you get all that? Anything you're still unclear about?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I got everything down.   
I'm not sure.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Good to hear. I hope your stay here is an enjoyable one.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Don't concern yourself with the details too much. Just go ahead and use the facilities as you please.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
As long as all of us remain considerate, the dorm will continue to be a comfortable living space for all.   
If there's anything you'd like to do here, you may want to invite the others to join you.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Yeah, we're all livin' under the same roof, after all. Better make the most of it!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I've never really done anything like this before, so I'm a little nervous...   
Happy - I'll try my best to enjoy myself here with you all.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
This may be coming a little late for most of you, but welcome to the dorm.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Thanks!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Thank you!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Thanks.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Arisato-kun, perfect timing. Would you mind heading to the rooftop with me?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What is it?   
Sure.   
No thanks.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - A quick answer. I like that.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - Now, now. No need to be so modest. We're all friends here, right?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - Haha, no need to be so wary of me.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
It isn't anything important... I just wanted to show you something.   
And I just so happen to have the key to the rooftop.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - Now then... Shall we go?

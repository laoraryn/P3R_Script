Student Emcee   
...That concludes the main portion of today's assembly.   
Next, we'll hear a word from the student council.   
Please welcome the new president, Mitsuru Kirijo, from Class 3-D.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Thank you.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
So she did get elected.   
Well... I guess she is the most popular girl in school.   
   
Junpei Iori   
You can say that again! She's got this intimidating vibe around her.   
Not to mention, this school's owned by the **Kirijo Group**, right?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
As I begin my term as student council president, I'd like to share with you my vision for this coming year.   
It is my firm belief that each of us must accept the responsibility of bettering our school.   
However, change cannot occur without sustained effort and an unprecedented level of commitment.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That is why we must restructure our daily lives in order to rise to this challenge.   
I'd like each of you to dig deeply into your well of motivation, and re-evaluate your convictions.   
Strive to imagine a bold new future without losing sight of the realities around you.   
That is the key.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
My own ideas are but one person's vision.   
For us to reap the full benefits of our education, your participation, opinions, and enthusiasm are essential.   
Thank you.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Dang... What a speech.   
Do you, uh, have any idea what she just said?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
1. Sort of.   
2. Not a clue.   
3. I wasn't listening.   
   
===1===   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sure didn't sound like somethin' a high schooler would say...   
If it was anyone else, we'd be laughin' our asses off.   
   
===2===   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Me neither...   
Sad - We live in the same dorm, but it's like we're on different planets...   
Sad - Man... If she asks for my opinion, I don't know what I'll say...   
   
===3===   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Dude...   
Sad - You're such a rebel...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Yo! Wanna stop by Paulownia Mall on the way back?   
Happy - Might wanna stock up while we can, since we got stuff goin' on at night.   
Happy - There's a pharmacy there too. Couldn't hurt to get some meds in case anything happens.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
1. You seem really into this.   
2. Maybe later.   
   
===2===   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - You bet I am! If we don't step up to the plate, who will?   
Happy - The chairman said it himself. The fate of the world depends on us!   
   
===2===   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Oh, c'mon... With that attitude, who knows what might happen to us?   
Sad - The chairman said it himself. The fate of the world depends on us!   
   
=======   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Let's go, Leader! First task: escape from the school!   
   
Junpei Iori   
I still can't believe this place turns into... that...   
   
Junpei Iori   
It's all normal now, but later we'll be like, "Shadows sighted! Take 'em down!"   
   
Junpei Iori   
The exit's by the giant stairca— I mean, the shoe lockers. Let's go!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Thin Student   
Look, it's Sanada-senpai!   
   
Gaudy Student   
Wait for us!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
......   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Have you noticed how popular Sanada-san is with the ladies? Man, take a look at that...   
Happy - I guess neither of us really got to know him before all this crazy stuff happened.   
He's the captain of the boxing team. Never lost a single match. I know that's cool and all, but...   
Who'da thought boxing would turn you into a chick magnet!?   
I mean, come on! They're fawning on him more than a harem manga! I wonder where they're going...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hey, are you guys free this afternoon?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Huh!? Er, us?   
Happy - I-I mean, hell yeah! We'd love to join your little, uh, group here...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
1. What about our shopping?   
2. What about the fate of the world?   
   
===1===   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - We can shop later!   
   
===2===   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Ah, don't be lame... Even heroes need some rest now and then, y'know?   
   
=======   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well? Are you free or not?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - O-Of course! Uh... No problemo!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I want the two of you to meet me at Paulownia Mall.   
You know where it is, right? I'll be waiting at the police station.   
Got it?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Th-The police station?   
Sad - You mean, we're not hangin' out with your friends...?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Who, these girls?   
No, I don't even know their names. Hearing so much chitchat gives me a headache.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Anyway, I'm going on ahead. Don't keep me waiting.   
   
Thin Student   
Wait, Senpai! Don't leave us!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Man, how can he not know their names!? I mean, seriously! Just look at them!   
Surprised - Uhh, anyway, let's go!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Sanada asked us to meet him at   
the Paulownia Mall police station...   
Junpei and I decided to head over.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
He said Paulownia Mall, right?   
I wonder what's up...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Dude, is Sanada-san blind, or just plain dumb?   
Those chicks were all over him! Man, I'm so jealous...   
   
Junpei Iori   
The police station...? There aren't any ladies there!   
Man, whatever. Let's just get it over with.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Thank you, Kurosawa-san. I'll be taking this.   
Oh, these are the guys I was talking about earlier.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
......   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
This is Officer Kurosawa. He helps keep our squad well-equipped.   
Oh, and here. This is from Ikutsuki-san.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Whoa, is that our war funds? Ya shouldn't have!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
DEV: *Unused message labels.    
*If this appears, it is a bug.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You can't fight empty-handed, so find something you like.   
Kurosawa-san has connections... He can secure equipment for us.   
Happy - But these things still cost money.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
Of course they do. Nothing in life is free.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - I realize that.   
Well, I'll see you later. Thanks again.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
I've been informed about you two.   
My job is to maintain peace in this city, regardless of the circumstances.   
I'm just an ordinary police officer, but it doesn't take a genius to know something strange is going on here.   
I'm only doing what I think is right. Nothing more.   
If you need something, we can talk in the back.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Can't believe the police station's sellin' weapons.   
What's more, they only gave us 5,000 yen! Ain't that kinda stingy? I mean, we're kinda savin' the world...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Oh, crap! It's this late already?   
I'm gonna miss the rerun of The Lonely Shogun! I gotta go!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
1. What about stocking up?   
2. Okay.   
   
===1===   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Uh, well, about that...   
Happy - I'll leave the rest to you, Leader! Let's meet up again you-know-where!   
   
===2===   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Sweet. I'll leave the rest to you!   
I know I'm the one who brought you here, but you'll see me again you-know-where.   
   
=======   
   
Junpei Iori   
There's a ton of shops and stuff in this place, so you really should check it out while you can.   
Happy - Alright, see ya back at the dorm!

In that moment, everything stopped.
All my thoughts began to fade,
like chalk on a sidewalk...
When I woke... it was to a peaceful day.
A peaceful town...
A peaceful school life...
And just like that, the
seasons quietly changed.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Yo!
Happy - Damn, it's cold. But of course, you never miss a day of school, huh? I'm impressed.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Man, this year really flew by... We're practically third-years now.
Happy - Only one more year of high school... Ya think there's anything interesting on the horizon?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Definitely.
You never know.

Junpei Iori
Hmm, you think so?
Lookin' at the current third-years, I'm not really sure...

Junpei Iori
Pretty much all they do is frickin' study. Sure doesn't look like fun to me.
Sad - Is that what we're gonna turn into next year...? Man, why do I feel like I'm forgetting something?

Junpei Iori

Sad - Is that what we're gonna turn into next year...? Man, why do I feel like I'm forgetting something?

Girl
......

Junpei Iori
Hey, is that girl... lookin' at us?
Happy - Dude, she's pretty cute! How come I never noticed her before?

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - What are you talking about? She lives in the same dorm as us.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Wait, she does!?
Uh... What's her name, then?

Yukari Takeba
I dunno.

Junpei Iori
Sheesh, then you barely know more than me.
Anyway, it's always crazy in the dorms this time of year, with so many people coming and going.

Junpei Iori
Oh yeah, did you hear? Sanada-senpai's movin' out.
You know him, right? He's the captain of the boxing team.

Yukari Takeba
Yeah, not that I really talk to him. And obviously all the graduates are leaving.
Kirijo-senpai is getting ready to move, too.

Junpei Iori
Kirijo... Oh, the student council president. She's in our dorm too, huh?

Yukari Takeba
Man, what's up with that girl?
Hey, there! Are you looking at us?
Is something wrong?

Girl
Oh, no... It's nothing.

Junpei Iori
She looked like she had somethin' on her mind, huh?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Wait, d'you think she might be interested in one of us!?

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Haha, not a chance.

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - ...Man, you really know how to hit a guy where it hurts...

The third-years are graduating today...
My second year of high school
is about to come to an end.
I better hurry to school...

Teacher
Next, a word from the valedictorian...
From Class D, Mitsuru Kirijo-san.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Thank you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
This last year, I accepted an important responsibility as student council president.
When I first addressed you from this podium...

Mitsuru Kirijo
I spoke to you all about seizing opportunity while you had the chance...
Well, it must have been fate that intervened and gave me an important reminder of this...

Mitsuru Kirijo
As many of you may know, my father unexpectedly passed away due to illness...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - To tell the truth, after losing my father, I also lost much of my self-confidence.
I had overestimated my ability to handle everything alone, because I believed it was the right thing to do.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Few people can be that strong...
Sad - There are times when we can't stand without the support of others...

Mitsuru Kirijo
After my father's death, I received kind words from many people.
You all taught me the value of allowing yourself to be cared for and protected.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I hope to continue forward with the support of those around me.
For us graduates, it was truly an honor to share the last three years with all of you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Looking away - Thank you so much... for those wonderful years...

Junpei Iori
Sad - Man, that sounds rough.

Junpei Iori
I guess even the student council president cries too, huh?

Minato Arisato - Selection
That was surprising.
She's only human.

Junpei Iori
Hey, she's not here...

Yukari Takeba
Who's not?

Junpei Iori
You know, that girl we saw at the front gate.
I thought she'd be at the graduation ceremony, but I guess not...

Yukari Takeba
Oh, her. Well, there's a lot of people who didn't show. Actually, I'm surprised YOU didn't skip.

Junpei Iori
No-shows, huh?
Man, so that's gonna be us next year? It feels so soon...
What're your plans, Yuka-tan? College?

Yukari Takeba
Hmm... I haven't really decided yet.

Yukari Takeba
What about you?

Minato Arisato - Selection
No idea.
I've got a plan.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Yeah, sounds about right.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Oh, really? That's a surprise.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - You know how the student council president was crying? I can sorta relate, since my dad passed away, too.
But that stuff she said about seizing opportunities? Gimme a break. How does she expect us to know what to do with that?
I mean, yeah, it's important, but that's more for people who already know what they want in life.

Junpei Iori
Well, at least one of us knows what he wants...
Happy - You seem to be getting along pretty well with a certain someone, if ya know what I mean...

Yukari Takeba
What're you talking about?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Oh, nothing, Yuka-tan.

Yukari Takeba
Hmm?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - What're you trying to say?

Junpei Iori
Happy - I dunno. You tell me.

Yukari Takeba
......

Yukari Takeba
Well, anyway, there's no hurry to decide what we wanna do with our lives, right?
I mean, I already have so much on my plate right now, you know?

Junpei Iori
Hmm, yeah, I guess that's true.

Yukari Takeba
Here's what I think...
If life is all about the pursuit of happiness, then knowing the truth isn't everything, right?
Sure, we do what we gotta do, but if we're taking a stand on every little thing, there'd be no end to it.

Yukari Takeba
In the end, it doesn't matter how you spend your time, as long as you're happy.
No one's gonna fault us for choosing to live in the moment, right?

Junpei Iori
Yeah, guess so.
Happy - Man, that was some speech.

Yukari Takeba
To be honest, I'm not that strong on my own...
And when I feel insecure, I get worked up.
Happy - It's hard to explain. It's just how I am.

Junpei Iori
Hey, I get it. Thinkin' never really gets me anywhere.
Happy - When that happens, I just go do somethin' fun and forget about it.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Haha, you would.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Everyone's so uptight these days.
Happy - They just need to chill out... You know, take it easy for a change.

Yukari Takeba
What're you gonna do if that plan backfires?

Junpei Iori
Happy - I'll figure somethin' out.
Happy - But for now, let the good times roll...
Happy - And on that note, who's down for karaoke, anyone? Let's celebrate our future!

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Celebrating is for the graduates.
Happy - Well... I'll go if he goes.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Hey, what's with the preferential treatment?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Well, now you're comin' whether you like it or not. I'll buy ya a drink, alright?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Looks like I don't have any other choice.
Should I go to karaoke with them?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Tag along
Smile and nod

It's Takeba. Are you awake?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Good morning.   
......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hello? Please answer the door, or I'm going to get in trouble!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Good morning. Did you sleep okay?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I've been asked to show you the way to school.   
Are you ready to go?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, I'm ready.   
I can find it myself.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Great! Let's head out.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Uh... Didn't expect you to turn me down.   
You don't want to risk being late on the first day, do you?   
Happy - C'mon, hurry and get ready!

Yukari Takeba   
This is how we'll be getting to school every day.   
It's a monorail! Pretty cool, huh?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I honestly love the ride here. It almost   
feels like we're flying over the ocean.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, by the way, our school's at the last stop   
on this line. It's called Tatsumi Port Island.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Have you heard of it? The whole thing's man-made,   
and our school's smack-dab in the middle.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, look! There it is now!   
   
Female Student   
Morning!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Morning!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Well, here we are.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Allow me to welcome you to Gekkoukan   
High School. I hope you like it!

Yukari Takeba   
Happy - You'll be okay on your own from here, right?   
Let's see... I guess you should go see your homeroom teacher first.   
The faculty office is over there on the left. They'll tell you more when you get there.   
Happy - Well, that about does it. Any questions before I go?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
1. Which class are you in?   
2. Not really.

Yukari Takeba   
Me? I dunno... I haven't looked at the classroom assignments yet.

Sad - Hey...   
Sad - About last night... Don't tell anyone what you saw, okay?   
Happy - See you!

Letting you know first.

MSG_002_0_0
Ikutsuki-san is coming tonight.
Sounds like he has something to tell us.
We'll meet on the 4th floor once we're all back.



===============================================================================================

Mitsuru Kirijo
...And that's the summary of what happened on the night of the 7th.
These Shadows seem to be quite a bit more formidable than the ordinary ones.

Shuji Ikutsuki
I see. So our enemies are growing stronger as well.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Well, it's not all bad news. In fact, I called today's meeting because—


Yukari Takeba
Hold on.
Before we go on, I'd like to ask Kirijo-senpai something.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I know I'm not the only one thinking this. So much has been happening lately...
I feel like I've just been getting dragged along without really understanding anything. But now, I want answers.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - So I'm gonna ask you straight out.
Angry - You've been hiding something from us, haven't you, Senpai?
Angry - You're always acting like you don't know anything about the Dark Hour or Tartarus.
Angry - But they're connected to that **accident ten years ago**, aren't they?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - What accident?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Y-Yukari-chan...?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - There was an explosion near our school, and a lot of people died.
Sad - It must've been big news back then. You know about it, don't you?

Mitsuru Kirijo
...Yes.

Yukari Takeba
Luckily, no students were injured. But something is off here.
At the time of the incident, there were several unexplained absences.
Seems like more than just a coincidence to me.

Mitsuru Kirijo
What do you mean?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Well, I dug up some old school records, and found something interesting.
Sad - Those students weren't just absent. They all suddenly collapsed and had to be sent to the hospital!
Sad - Sounds familiar, doesn't it?
Sad - Remember those girls who bullied Fuuka? They had to be hospitalized too.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - ......

Yukari Takeba
Angry - I want an explanation!
Angry - What really happened on the day of that accident?
Angry - The Kirijo Group built our school, so you have to know something!
Angry - Tell me the truth!

Mitsuru Kirijo
I wasn't trying to hide anything from you. It just never seemed relevant.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - But...

Shuji Ikutsuki
It's okay. It's not your fault.

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right.
I'll tell you everything.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Shadows have many mysterious abilities.
Some research indicates they can even affect time and space.
We think of them as our enemies, but what if we could somehow use them to our advantage?
They could be a source of unimaginable power, couldn't they?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - What...?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Fourteen years ago, one man pursued that very line of thinking.
He was the former leader of the Kirijo Group, Kouetsu Kirijo.
...My grandfather.

===============================================================================================

Mitsuru Kirijo
My grandfather was obsessed with the Shadows...

Mitsuru Kirijo
He wanted to harness their power
to create something extraordinary.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Create something extraordinary...?

Mitsuru Kirijo
To that end, he assembled a research team
and had them amass a number of Shadows.

Junpei Iori
He was collectin' 'em!?
Damn, that's freakin' crazy!

Mitsuru Kirijo
But ten years ago, during the final stages of the project,
there was an accident... and the experiment failed.

Mitsuru Kirijo
They lost control of the Shadows' power,
altering the nature of the entire world.

Fuuka Yamagishi
You can't mean...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Yes... Tartarus and the Dark Hour.

Yukari Takeba
......

Junpei Iori
Huh!?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Huh!?

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Sad - ......

Mitsuru Kirijo
According to the records, the accumulated mass of Shadows split into several large ones that later dispersed.
These are the Shadows we've been encountering on nights when the moon is full.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Maybe... that's why it's difficult to predict where they'll appear?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Wait a minute...
Sad - If what you said is true, then why did our school turn into Tartarus?
Surprised - Don't tell me...
Surprised - Is it because that's where they conducted the experiment!?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Yes.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Then those students who were hospitalized...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - It's just as you fear.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It was a highly populated area, and the Kirijo Group had influence there. They could essentially do as they pleased.
Port Island must have been the perfect location for them.
So yes, as you guessed, the experiment ten years ago was conducted at Gekkoukan High School.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Just what are you trying to say here?
Sad - So that's the whole purpose behind SEES?
Sad - We were dragged into all this just to clean up their mess!?

Yukari Takeba
[cut 2 2 0]

Yukari Takeba
Angry - You lied to us?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - ......

Yukari Takeba
Angry - And you knew too, didn't you, Sanada-senpai?
Angry - You've both just been using us!
Angry - Or do you not care, as long as you're the one who gets to do the fighting?

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - I never said anything like that!

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - I... have my reasons.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Think what you'd like, but it was my decision not to share the information.
Sad - I'm sorry.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It was never my intent to deceive you.
Convincing you to join SEES was my highest priority.
I know it may not be fair, but Shadows can only be defeated by Persona-users. We are the only ones who can fight.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - That's hardly the point!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I never had a choice either... It didn't matter if I wanted this power or not.
Sad - I...

Akihiko Sanada
Mitsuru, that's enough.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Takeba-kun, it's only those in the past who are to blame.
And they lost their lives as a result of what they did.
We're all in the same boat, here. None of us deserve the burden that's been thrust upon us.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - But that's...
Sad - ......

Shuji Ikutsuki
It's been ten years since the incident in question. No one knows why those Shadows suddenly returned.
But now that they're here, we have the chance to find and destroy them.
Do you realize what that means?

Shuji Ikutsuki
What if I told you that the twelve Shadows are the cause of everything?

Akihiko Sanada
Surprised - You're saying if we defeat them all, Tartarus and the Dark Hour will disappear?

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Exactly!

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - That's what I was going to tell you earlier. See, it's good news, isn't it?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Can that really be true!?

Shuji Ikutsuki
There's evidence to support it.
And this is where our true battle begins.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Our true battle...

Shuji Ikutsuki
Regardless of what's happened in the past, we must fight to protect the people.
The Shadows are gaining strength. We can't afford to wait for them to strike first.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Right.

Shuji Ikutsuki
And there are still many mysteries surrounding Tartarus.
For instance, why did such a gigantic structure appear in the first place? The answers must be out there somewhere.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Hm...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We must defeat the twelve
Shadows that started all of this...
...In order to eradicate both
the Dark Hour and Tartarus.
I must fight to protect everyone.
Six of them remain...

Hi.

Pharos
It's pretty chilly tonight.
Can you believe it's already autumn? It'll be winter before you know it.

Pharos
...You look a little tired.
Did something happen?

Minato Arisato - Selection
No.
I lost a friend.
Not to me...

Pharos
I see...
If you say so...

Pharos
Sad - ...Oh, you did?

Pharos
...I see. It's a good thing it wasn't you.

Pharos
In this world, people die every day.
Until recently, I thought that was as normal as the changing of the seasons.
Sad - But now, I understand why people mourn...

Pharos
Happy - For the first time, I have a friend.

Pharos
Lately, I've been remembering things more clearly...
You recall the end I've spoken of? Some are calling it "the Fall" as well...

Pharos
It's drawing closer each night. Can't you feel it?
You and I are like kindred spirits, so I wonder why I'm the only one who remembers...

Pharos
Sad - This is tearing me up...
Sad - Could it be that you can't accept me for who I am?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Pharos is smiling sadly...
I sense a bond between Pharos and me...

Pharos
I'm sorry if I wasn't making any sense today... Maybe it's the change of season.
But, we're still friends. That will never change.
Well, I'll be going for now. Good night.

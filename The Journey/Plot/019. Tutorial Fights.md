Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right. Let's start by going over how to attack Shadows.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
When faced with an enemy, you have two primary options for fending them off. The first option is to use your equipped weapon.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The second option is to use your Persona. But remember, every Persona has its own strengths and weaknesses.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Knowing how Personas work will be crucial. Try summoning yours right now.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Okay... Looks like I'm up!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Here goes. Check this out...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Persona!   
   
-----   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right. Next, let's go over a useful approach for defeating enemies.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Most enemies have an elemental affinity that they have low resistance to. Targeting weaknesses is one of the best ways to deal damage.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Not only that, it can also knock enemies down.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Knocking down an enemy creates an opening, letting you continue your offense.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Weaknesses, huh? Got it! I'll show you how it's done...!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Wait! ...Let me handle this one.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hurt - Just point it to my head... then pull the trigger...!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - I can do this...!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Whoa! You're not so bad yourself, Yuka-tan!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - That's it, Takeba.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You give it a try as well.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Well done. You struck the enemy's weakness.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Keep that up and finish off the rest.   
   
TRL_732_1_1   
Enemies can have weaknesses to certain affinities. Hitting an enemy's weakness will knock them down, allowing you to act again.   
   
-----   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Next, I'm going to explain a tactic for defeating several enemies at once.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
First, go ahead and strike an enemy's weakness.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'll keep track of tactical data such as any enemy weaknesses you've identified.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - If you ever forget an enemy's affinities, just let me know and I'll get that data for you.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right, now knock down the other one. That's when you perform an All-Out Attack.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - An All-Out Attack?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's a maneuver that engages the entire team in a coordinated assault when all enemies have been knocked down.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Naturally, the enemy has no way of defending against this. It's one of the most reliable means of attack.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Whoa! That sounds so badass! Let's give it a try right now!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
One other thing I should mention, though: as obvious as it sounds, you can't perform an All-Out Attack alone.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
So, if you want it in your arsenal, you'll need at least two members available in the fight.   
   
TRL_733_1_1   
Pressing the L1 button will allow you to view the affinities of a selected enemy.   
   
TRL_733_1_2   
This allows you to confirm which attack affinities you've used on that specific enemy.   
   
TRL_733_2_1   
When all enemies are knocked down, you will have the option to perform an All-Out Attack. This deals heavy damage to all enemies, so try and knock down enemies as often as possible.   
   
TRL_733_2_2   
All-Out Attacks cannot be performed with only one available party member. You will also be unable to perform All-Out Attacks if you are afflicted with certain status ailments.   
   
TRL_733_3_1   
After winning a battle, there is a rare chance of Shuffle Time occurring. During Shuffle Time, your potential will be shown in the form of cards.   
   
TRL_733_3_2   
Depending on the card you choose, you can receive various rewards.   
   
-----   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I've covered the basics of combat now, but the most important thing is making decisions based on the situation at hand.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'll continue providing support, but this time, go ahead and try fighting on your own.   
   
Igor   
You, my boy, are able to possess multiple Personas and summon them at will.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I can feel a new potential within myself...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Your Persona just now... It looks like you really do have a special power.   
   
TRL_734_1_1   
Minato carries multiple Personas, and can switch which he summons by using Change Persona.   
   
TRL_734_1_2   
Changing Personas will also change your stats, affinities, and usable skills based on the Persona you switch to.   
   
TRL_734_1_3   
During battle, open the Persona submenu to view skills, then press L1 or R1 to change Personas.   
   
TRL_734_1_4   
You can also change your equipped Persona outside of battle by pressing △ to open the menu, then navigating to the Persona submenu.   
   
TRL_734_1_5   
You can change Personas at any time, but in battle, you can only do so before taking action that turn.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
...!   
   
-----   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right, let me tell you about a new tactic called "Shifting."   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
When you knock an enemy down, Shifting allows you to leverage that opening to let someone else take action.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Once you do, your offense can follow up with whoever you passed your action to.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - If you can coordinate well with your team, you'll be able to claim victory with even greater efficiency.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You should all be experienced enough to pull this off now. Go ahead and give it a try.   
   
TRL_737_1_1   
You are able to Shift your own "1 More" action to another teammate. Press the L2 button to pass your action to someone else and navigate battles more effectively.   
   
-----   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You're up against a difficult opponent. But if the intel is available, I can help you.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I can suggest the most effective attack, based on the enemy's weakness.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
But, I can only assist like this when we know the enemy's weakness.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm sorry, but until you can get more information, you'll be on your own.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The enemy here looks tough. But if we have any intel on them, I can help you.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I can tell you what attack will work best based on the enemy's weakness.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - But, I can only assist you like that when we already know what an enemy's weak to...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You'll need to analyze them first before I can help.   
   
TRL_801_1_1   
Press the R1 button during battle to use the Assist function.   
   
TRL_801_1_2   
If there is a skill available that can strike the enemy's weakness, then the cursor will automatically highlight it.   
   
TRL_801_1_3   
This will help speed up menu navigation during battle, so give it a try.   
   
-----   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The enemy's attacks are growing stronger...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If you're being overwhelmed by the enemy's assault, protect yourselves by guarding.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
When you guard, even if your weakness is struck, you can avoid being knocked down.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Try and make use of that in battle.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The enemy's attacks are growing stronger...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If you're being overwhelmed by the enemy's assault, protect yourselves by guarding.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If you're guarding, then even if your weakness is struck, you can avoid being knocked down.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Try and make use of that in battle.   
   
TRL_802_1_1   
By guarding against an enemy attack, you can halve damage received.   
   
TRL_802_1_2   
Furthermore, you will avoid being knocked down, even if your weakness is struck.   
   
TRL_802_1_3   
If an enemy is winding up for a powerful attack, or if you think your weakness will be targeted, try guarding to play it safe.

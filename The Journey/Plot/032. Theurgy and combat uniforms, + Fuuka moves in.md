Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh good, you're all here.
I know this is sudden, but the chairman will be coming by again this evening.
I'd like everyone to gather at the usual place tonight.

Junpei Iori
He just came by the other day. Somethin' happen?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Apparently he's prepared some special gifts for us.
I know it'll be busy with Yamagishi moving into the dorm, but I'd appreciate it if you could all come by.

Junpei Iori
Special? Does that mean we can expect something good?

Yukari Takeba
I dunno. This is Ikutsuki-san we're talking about.
He's probably just gonna tell us some new joke he made up.

===============================================================================================

Yukari's Voice
Yamagishi-san, are you in there?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Yes, come in.

Yukari Takeba
I think we should start heading to the command room, and— Huh?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - You already finished unpacking? I was planning on helping you out later, too!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Well, I didn't have too much with me, so I finished a lot sooner than I expected.

Yukari Takeba
Oh, are you good with computers, by any chance?
You think you could teach me? I'm really not good with stuff like that.

Fuuka Yamagishi
S-Sure, if you'd like me to.

Yukari Takeba
Are you looking into something?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Yes, I figured I should know everyone's defining characteristics and whatnot, to prepare for battle.
I can't do any actual fighting, so I need to make myself useful.

Yukari Takeba
Oh, I see.
You're a really hard worker, Yamagishi-san. And you've got an amazing ability too.

Yukari Takeba
Now that I think about it, everyone in this dorm is pretty amazing, huh?
Sanada-senpai is hands down one of the strongest, and Arisato-kun has a power unlike anyone else's.
I bet Kirijo-senpai's strong, too. And Junpei... Well, he's whatever.

Yukari Takeba
But what do I have? I'm only half the person everyone else here is. I couldn't even do anything the last full moon.
Maybe I don't need to be here after all, haha.

Fuuka Yamagishi
That's not true at all.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Huh?

Fuuka Yamagishi
I was told that a Persona is the power of the soul, also known as your other self.
That's why I think a person's personality and feelings are reflected in their Persona.

Fuuka Yamagishi
For example, Takeba-san, your Persona has healing powers, right?
That's because there's a kindness in you that no one else has.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - I... I'm not kind at all.
I just don't want to see anyone go down or get hurt, that's all...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - ......

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - C'mon. I think Ikutsuki-san's gonna be here soon.
Happy - Oh, and you can just call me Yukari. I hope you like it here, Fuuka.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I'm sure I will.
Happy - Thank you, Yukari-chan.

===============================================================================================



Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Sorry for calling you all again so soon, but I brought something special today.
Happy - Well, let me just show you before I get into explaining what it is.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - I'd like to provide you with some **new equipment**.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - After spending quite some time in development, we're now ready for the battle testing phase.

（ＳＥ）伊織 順平
おお…


（ＳＥ）岳羽 ゆかり
へえ…


（ＳＥ）真田 明彦
ほう…


（ＳＥ）桐条 美鶴
フム…


（ＳＥ）山岸 風花
わ…

Shuji Ikutsuki
The Shadows are getting stronger. You just barely won the last battle.
We can only assume they'll grow even more powerful still. That's why you all need something more to stay in the fight.
From now on, I want everyone to use these during your operations.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Combat gear, complete with a matching armband, and...
Your new trump card in the battle against the Shadows: cartridges that enable the use of **Theurgy**.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Trump card?
Theurgy...?

Shuji Ikutsuki
Theurgy means "spiritual magic that could reach the gods" in Greek.
To put it simply, it synchronizes with the user's emotions, and when the right conditions are met, allows them to unleash an attack of immense power.

Shuji Ikutsuki
[cut 3 1 0]

Junpei Iori
Happy - Oh, you're talking about signature attacks! Aw, yeah! I've been waitin' for something like this!
Happy - Okay, how does it work!?

Shuji Ikutsuki
Well, about that... It's a bit difficult to explain.
Happy - I think it might be easier if you just try it out for yourselves.

Minato Arisato - Selection
You're asking a lot.
All right.
Is it dangerous?

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Oh, please. If you can handle a Persona, this should hardly be any more difficult.
Happy - It's been thoroughly tested for safety, too. So nothing to worry about there.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Hold on, isn't it dangerous to use something like this without knowing how it works?

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Oh, don't worry about that. It's been well-tested and determined completely safe.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Oh, don't worry about that. It's been well-tested and determined completely safe.
Happy - I'm sure you'll get a chance to see it in action as you continue your battles.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Oh, there's a manual for it as well. Take a look at it if you feel the need.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Well, I'm sure glad I made it in today.
With Yamagishi-kun joining us, Kirijo-kun can go back to being a frontline fighter. That means SEES is going to have a new lineup after today.
And what better time than now to roll out this new weapon, don't you agree?

Shuji Ikutsuki
Surprised - Oh, would you look at the time?

Shuji Ikutsuki
I'd like to talk more about this, but I've been quite busy with the investigation into those large Shadows.
Happy - I think we're on the verge of a breakthrough though, so I'll be sure to let you know what we find out soon.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Okay. I'm leaving the rest to you, Kirijo-kun.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - And there he goes...

Fuuka Yamagishi
I sort of thought this before, but he's rather laid-back, isn't he?

Junpei Iori
Happy - More like careless.

Akihiko Sanada
It's fine. We should just give it a go, like the chairman said.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - In fact, since everyone's already here, now might be the best opportunity.
Let's head into Tartarus and try out our new equipment.
I've been wanting to get back into the swing of things, anyway. And this will serve as a good test of our team lineup with Yamagishi as backup.

Mitsuru Kirijo
How does that sound, Arisato?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I don't mind.
Looking forward to this.
Sounds like a pain.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Then it's settled.
Scheming - Let's give this Theurgy stuff a shot. Can't wait to see what kind of punch it's packing.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Man, this trump card stuff is getting me so pumped up!
Happy - I'm gonna be all like, "Take this! Super Ace Junpei Attack!" ...Or something like that.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Aw, don't be like that. He brought these just for us.
Happy - And you wouldn't wanna miss out on my super cool finishing move, would ya?

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - That I don't care about, but we should go for Fuuka's sake, so she can get used to things.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I'm a little nervous since it's my first time, but I'll follow your lead.

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right, we'll go into Tartarus once everyone is geared up.

（ＳＥ）伊織 順平
おうっス！


（ＳＥ）岳羽 ゆかり
はい。


（ＳＥ）真田 明彦
ああ。


（ＳＥ）山岸 風花
はいっ。

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
Happy - Oh man, this is awesome! We're like a super elite task force!

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - C'mon, could you at least wear it like you're supposed to?
Oh, but it does look like everyone's outfits are a bit different.

Akihiko Sanada
Each one is made to complement our physiques and fighting styles.
Happy - They were testing the prototype out on me, but it feels even better than it did before.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - It's very light and sturdy. I wonder if it's the same materials they use in the military, or maybe even the ones for spacesuits.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Seems like this armband isn't just for decoration either.

Fuuka Yamagishi
According to the manual, there are a bunch of different features built into it.
For example, it can give you a readout of your vitals. What else...?
Surprised - There's also a function that notifies you when you can use your Theurgy...?

Minato Arisato - Selection
How do you use it?
What does that do?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Sorry, it doesn't look like there's much information about that.
Sad - All I can tell is that you load the cartridge into your Evoker to use it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Then let's make that our objective for today. Make sure to stay alert, everyone.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - All right, Yamagishi, you're going to be our backup, just like I mentioned before.
This time, I'll be joining the rest of you in battle.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - I'm going too. I gotta make sure my skills are still sharp.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - M-Me too!

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right, then including Arisato, that will be our team.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Wait, I wanna go too!
Surprised - I was so ready for this! You can't just put me on standby!

Akihiko Sanada
We can't go without Arisato.
You stay here and support Yamagishi.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Only you can do it, Junpei.
You're our last line of defense.
Gotta keep our ace in reserve.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Oh, really?

Junpei Iori
Happy - When you put it that way, how can I refuse? Don't worry, Fuuka. Nothing's getting past me!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Exasperated* - Uh, okay...

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - There he goes again.

Yukari Takeba
Fuuka, if it gets too dangerous, just leave him behind. And don't be afraid to smack him if he tries anything funny.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Okay, got it.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Huh? You get it!?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Yamagishi, could you scout the area and find a good floor for us to start on?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Okay.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Closed eyes, concentrating - ......
Closed eyes, concentrating - It seems... different in here from before?

Junpei Iori
Well, that's nothing new, right?

Fuuka Yamagishi
No, not like that. It seems distorted... It's probably just temporary.
I'll try and find a stable floor for us to start on.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - You can tell that much already? Wow, Fuuka!

Akihiko Sanada
It could be because we didn't enter the usual way last time, or because of those huge Shadows.
We have no idea what's gonna happen in here. Not that I'm complaining though.

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right, let's go.

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Huh!?
Surprised - What? Why is it all dark? Where did everyone go!?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please, everybody, just stay calm!
It looks like you were all sent to different locations on this floor.

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - So they separated us by force.

Mitsuru Kirijo
There's danger lurking in this darkness.
We need to regroup as soon as possible. Yamagishi, can you guide us?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Ugh, why now...?
Sad - Fuuka, where should I go if I want to—


Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - ...!
Surprised - Yukari-chan, look out!

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Huh?


Yukari Takeba
Hurt - Aaah!

Yukari Takeba
Hurt - Ngh...

Yukari Takeba

Yukari Takeba

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Arisato-kun, you're here!

Yukari Takeba

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Arisato-kun, are you okay?
Sad - I'm sorry. It was all my fault.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Good to see you're okay.
What was that just now...?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Thanks. But you shouldn't be so reckless.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I don't really know. My body just sort of took control.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - Takeba! Arisato!

Akihiko Sanada
Looks like you both are okay.

Yukari Takeba
Sorry I worried everyone.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It's all right. You did well in handling an unexpected situation.

Akihiko Sanada
Maybe we should consider starting over. Let's head back to the entrance for now.

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
Happy - Good work out there, team!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - I'm sorry. I should have been able to navigate better.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Not a problem.
You did great for your first time.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I agree. I'm convinced that you're the one we need on support.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Yeah, thanks a lot, Fuuka.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I didn't do anything. It was all you, Yukari-chan.

Junpei Iori
Happy - That special attack sure was cool though, Yuka-tan! How'd you do it?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - How...?
Looking away - I just focused really hard and thought to myself, I have to do whatever it takes.
Looking away - And while I was thinking that, I kind of felt something surging inside me.

Akihiko Sanada
The chairman did say the cartridge would synchronize with our emotions.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Right. Although, I'm still not entirely sure how it works.
From what I could tell, it reacted to Yukari-chan's strong emotions.

Mitsuru Kirijo
So this weapon gives the user strength beyond their limits when their emotions are heightened?

Junpei Iori
Uh, I don't really get it...
Happy - But basically, if we're fired up enough, we can really pop off, right!?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - And thanks to you, Yukari-chan, we have a good idea of how it works.
Happy - From now on, I should be able to tell when someone can use theirs.

Minato Arisato - Selection
It's all thanks to Yukari.
I'm dying to try for myself.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I-I didn't do much.
Looking away - I just got lucky. I don't know much more than anyone else.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Me too, me too!
Scheming - Actually, I'm pretty fired up right now. Maybe I can already cook one up!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Exasperated* - U-Um, actually I think it's too dangerous to use here, Junpei-kun.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'll do more research into how the syncing with emotions works later.
Everyone has different feelings when they're fighting, so the timing on when they can use these will probably be different too.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - I'd like to give it a go myself, but we should call it a day for now.
We can't overwork Arisato, and we've got some time until the next full moon.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - I'm a little worried about the change with the floors though. What if something like that happens again?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Exasperated* - Yes, if something has changed in the tower, we'll need to be extra careful when exploring from now on.

Mitsuru Kirijo
In any case, we may have had some problems, but we learned a lot today.
Not only did we get to test our new lineup and equipment, but we also got to see that we're all improving at a remarkable pace.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Aww, Kirijo-senpai! Quit buttering me up!
Happy - Just leave everything to Junpei Iori, the soon-to-be MVP!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Maybe I shouldn't be the one to say this, but...
Sad - You literally didn't do anything today.

Junpei Iori

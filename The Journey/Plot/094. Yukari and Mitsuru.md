Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Oh, sorry. No one was here, so I figured it'd be okay.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It's rare to see you here... Is it for the archery team?

Yukari Takeba
Yes. The teacher wanted a report...

Mitsuru Kirijo
I see... That's a lot of responsibility.

Yukari Takeba
Oh, not really. It's nothing compared to what you have to do...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Actually, uh, I wanted to ask you something.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hm?

Yukari Takeba
Senpai... What are you fighting for?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Well, I...
Sad - I guess you could say... it's my way of atoning for the past.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - In my case... I don't think I really have a reason anymore.
Sad - I mean, I know the whole story about my father now.
Sad - I guess I could still fix the mistakes he left behind though...

Mitsuru Kirijo
......

Yukari Takeba
Maybe I should have thought about this earlier, huh...
But it took me this long to start questioning myself.

Mitsuru Kirijo
That's understandable.

Yukari Takeba
It seems like everyone has their own reason for fighting...
Well, defeating the Shadows is probably a good enough reason, huh?

Mitsuru Kirijo
What are you trying to say?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - ...I'm not exactly sure.
Sad - But it's all gonna be over after the next full moon, so there's not much point in thinking about it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - ...That's true.
Happy - Once we put an end to this, we can go back to a normal high school life.

Mitsuru Kirijo
The rest of the student council will be here soon. We can pick this up later though, if you want...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Oh, no, that's okay. Thanks for listening.

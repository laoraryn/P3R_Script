Ms. Toriumi   
All right, everyone. Today we have yet another transfer student.   
Is this really our third one? Guess that makes it a hat trick.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Angry - ......   
Angry - Go on, introduce yourself.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
My name's Ryoji Mochizuki.   
Happy - I'd appreciate it if you could show me the ropes.   
   
Female Student   
Hey, he's kinda cute.   
   
Student's Friend   
I was thinking the same thing.   
   
Female Student   
Hey, not so loud!   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
It's nice to meet you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
...?   
I'm pretty sure he's looking at me...   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
He was living overseas for a long time due to his parents' work.   
And that means he might not be familiar with all of our customs.   
Be sure to give him a hand if there's something he doesn't understand.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Thanks.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Now then, you need a seat. Let's see...   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
That one's open. Up front, second from the left.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Oh, um, Ms. Toriumi? That seat's taken.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
You don't show up, you lose your seat. Have I not been clear about this?   
Life is just a game of musical chairs. Let that be a lesson to the rest of you.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Uh-huh.   
   
Aigis   
Angry - ......   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Hey there.   
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.   
   
Aigis   
Angry - You... are dangerous.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Surprised - Dangerous? I haven't even asked you out to dinner yet.   
   
Aigis   
Dinner?   
......   
Sad - ...?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Aigis, what's the matter?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Haha, rejected right off the bat. You're one interesting girl.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - What the heck?   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Sad - Your teacher understands, Aigis.   
Sad - You barely had time in the spotlight as the new kid, and now you have to share it.   
Angry - Except right now, you should be paying attention to me. Hey, is anyone even listening?

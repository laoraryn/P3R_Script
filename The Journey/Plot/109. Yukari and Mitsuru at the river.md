School excursion, day two...   
Today's itinerary: visiting   
Kyoto's historical sites.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I went sightseeing around   
Kyoto aboard a tour bus...   
It was much more exciting seeing the   
historical locations in person than in photos.   
In the afternoon, we all went our separate   
ways at the Kamogawa River, near the hotel.

We should probably head back. We don't wanna miss curfew.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Not to mention Shijo Street will be crawling with drunks and couples the longer we stay.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Why are you so concerned about me?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - It was our fight that brought us together. And now, that fight is over.   
Sad - We have no common goal, no enemy to defeat. You have no reason to associate with me anymore.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - You don't have to be hurtful about this...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - We've reached our conclusion. Why should we keep fighting?   
Sad - Everything I believed in was a lie. And in the end, I...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - You what?   
Angry - You couldn't protect someone important to you? Is that what you're trying to say?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - You said you wanted to atone for the Kirijo Group's past, but that's not true.   
Angry - You were really only fighting to protect your father.

Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - That's right! I fought to protect him, and look what happened!   
Angry - I was blinded by my trust for Ikutsuki, and fell right into his trap! There was nothing I could do!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - My father bore the burden of responsibility entirely on his own.   
Angry - And ever since that incident, he looked like he was dead inside.   
Angry - I fought so he could be free of the shame and guilt weighing down on him!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - ......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - But it was all pointless. I never should have gotten involved!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - Am I wrong!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Ngh...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Sorry.   
Angry - But we don't know that for sure yet.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - ......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You know, I used to live around here.   
After my dad died, my mom spent all her time throwing herself at random men.   
I couldn't stand seeing that side of her, so I used to come out here to the riverbank to get away.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
At that point, believing in my dad was all I had.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Your father only did what he thought was best.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
He was involved in dangerous work, but in the end, he fought to make things right.   
He believed the Shadows needed to be stopped, even if it meant losing his life.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - That's why I choose to fight.   
Angry - I'm going to destroy the Dark Hour and finish what my dad started.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Finish what he started...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
That's all I can do. That we can do.   
Right, Mitsuru-senpai?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Takeba...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - You're right.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - It's not over just yet.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We're going to see this through to the end.   
For my father's sake... and for yours.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Senpai...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yukari, let's face what comes next together, okay?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Of course.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - All right, let's head on back and check out the bath.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - The bath?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Yeah, the outdoor hot spring back at the hotel. It's really nice.   
Happy - Now that everything's out in the open, we have nothing left to hide!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Nothing...?   
Happy - Well now, this is awkward.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - H-Hey, stop blushing! You're making this awkward for both of us!   
Happy - C'mon, let's get going! It's already past curfew.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You don't need to worry, Father.   
I'm not alone.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
And I won't turn back anymore.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The resolution in Mitsuru's heart has awakened a new Persona...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Mitsuru's Persona, **Penthesilea**, has given rise to **Artemisia**!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Please watch over me.

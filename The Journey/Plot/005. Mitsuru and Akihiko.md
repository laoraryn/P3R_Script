Confident Student   
I'm going out for a bit.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Hm?   
   
Confident Student   
Have you seen the newspapers lately? There's a lot going on.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I know.   
Severe cases of Apathy Syndrome are suddenly developing in people who showed no symptoms prior...   
It's been quite a topic of discussion.   
They say it's due to stress, but...   
   
Confident Student   
Yeah, right. It's gotta be them.   
Happy - Otherwise, it's not worth my time.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You have a one-track mind... Will you be okay out there on your own?   
   
Confident Student   
Happy - Don't worry. I'm just getting a little practice.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Exasperated* - ...This isn't a game, Akihiko.

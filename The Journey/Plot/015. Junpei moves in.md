Yukari's Voice
Hey, you in there?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
...?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Looks like I slept till nighttime...

Yukari's Voice
If you are, could you come downstairs? Sanada-senpai's calling for us.

-----

Yukari Takeba
Okay, he's here. So what's this about?

Akihiko Sanada
Thanks for coming. There's someone I want to introduce.

Akihiko Sanada
Exasperated* - ...Hey, hurry up.

Voice from Outside
Just a sec... This thing's freakin' heavy.

[yukari surprised cut in]

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Wha— Junpei!? Why are you here!?
Surprised - Don't tell me...

Akihiko Sanada
This is Junpei Iori from Class 2-F. He'll be staying here from now on.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Eheheh... 'Sup?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - He's staying here!? Are you sure there wasn't some mistake?

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - I bumped into him the other night.
Happy - He has the potential, but he just awakened to it recently.
Happy - I told him about us, and he agreed to help out.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Really? You have the potential!?

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - He found me cryin' like a baby at the convenience store, surrounded by a bunch of coffins.
Happy - I don't remember much, but man, that's embarrassing!
Happy - But he said that's, y'know, completely normal... in the beginning.
Happy - Like, bein' confused and not remembering anything. Did you guys know that?

Minato Arisato - Selection
1. Uh-huh.
2. Nope.
3. Didn't happen to me.

===1===

Junpei Iori
Happy - Oh, right. Of course.
Happy - Makes sense, since you're a Persona-user and all.

===2===

Junpei Iori
Happy - What, have you not talked to anyone about it?
Happy - You should know, since you're a Persona-user and all.

===3===

Junpei Iori
Happy - Hey, what's with the tough-guy act?
Happy - You should know about it, since you're a Persona-user and all.

=======

Junpei Iori
But man... I still can't believe it.
I had no idea you guys had this stuff goin' on too.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Well, I'm glad I'm not the only one. Wouldn't really wanna be doin' this on my own.
Happy - You gotta be stoked too, right!? Havin' me join?

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - What...?
Exasperated* - Uh, I guess...

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Well, enough with the introductions.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Now that our forces have increased...
Happy - I think we're about ready.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Ooh, we gonna go do somethin'?
Happy - Sweetness! I'm gettin' pumped!

Akihiko Sanada
With this many people, we can start checking out that tower.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Oh... You mean Tartarus.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Tartar sauce? Wha...?

Akihiko Sanada
It's a place that holds the key to understanding the Dark Hour... or so we think.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - The key, huh...

Akihiko Sanada
The chairman will give us more details tomorrow night, so be ready.

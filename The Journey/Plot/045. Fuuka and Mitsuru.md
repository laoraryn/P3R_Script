Fuuka Yamagishi   
Yes?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Can I talk to you for a moment?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Senpai... This is unusual.   
Please, come in.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
So, not only do you excel at providing support during battle, you are also quite skilled at gathering information.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh, I-I'm sorry for doing that without permission.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Don't worry, you're not in trouble. But I do have an important favor to ask of you.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I want you to find out as much as you can about that incident ten years ago.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Oh, well, very little of that was made public...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I know. That's why I want you to access the Kirijo Group's database.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - You mean, hack into their system?   
Is that allowed?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'll give you my ID and password. Then you won't be held accountable.   
But I need to know the truth. In detail.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Senpai...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Of course, I'll understand if you refuse.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Okay. I'll see what I can do.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Are you sure?   
I appreciate it.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yamagishi... Aren't you resentful?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Regardless of my good intentions, I did drag you into this without fully explaining.   
I'm sure you must have at least a few complaints?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Not really.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Did you know my entire family's made up of doctors? My parents are the one exception.   
Sad - It gives them a bit of an inferiority complex. That's why they're so hard on me.   
Sad - ...I don't like being at home.   
But here, I'm able to do something no one else can. I have a purpose.   
So no, I don't have any complaints.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You're right. We can't do this without you.   
No one could take your place.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - O-Oh...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Thank you. I'll see you later.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Do you have a moment?
I was just told that the chairman will be stopping by this evening.
When you get back, make sure to come to the fourth floor.

Yukari Takeba
Oh, okay then.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'll see you all later.

Junpei Iori
Talk about short notice. Maybe he wants to tell us a new joke?

Yukari Takeba
Who knows...?
But I am a little curious. Guess I'll head straight back today.

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Koro-chan, shake!

White Dog
Happy - Arf!

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Oooh, he did it! What a smart dog.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, welcome back, Arisato-kun.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Hey there!

Minato Arisato - Selection
What's with the dog?
Can I pet him?

Yukari Takeba
He was passing by just a little while ago.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Go on, Koro-chan!
You know how to say hi, right?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sure.
Go on, Koro-chan!
You know how to say hi, right?

White Dog
Woof!

Fuuka Yamagishi
His name's Koromaru.
I've seen him sitting by the steps of the shrine.

Passing Housewife
Oh, this dog still goes on walks all by himself?

Yukari Takeba
What do you mean?

Passing Housewife
He used to belong to the priest at the Naganaki Shrine.
Every afternoon, the two of them went this way for a walk.

Fuuka Yamagishi
So that's what he was doing here.

Passing Housewife
That is, until the priest passed away.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - He passed away?

Passing Housewife
Oh, you haven't heard the story?
I think it was about six months ago.
The priest was hit by a car while walking his dog. He didn't survive.
Ever since then, that dog has continued to go on walks, always stopping to sit by the site of the accident.
But he refuses to let anyone take him in. Why, just the other day, my son—


Fuuka Yamagishi - MND_018_0_0

Passing Housewife
Oh my goodness, look at the time! I must be going! My son will be home soon.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Aww, you're such a loyal dog! Good boy!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Huh? Is he...?

Yukari Takeba
What's wrong?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, nothing. Sorry.
More importantly, isn't the chairman coming today?
We should probably go get ready.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Yeah, you're right. See you later, Koro-chan.

Koromaru
Arf!



Shuji Ikutsuki
Hello, everyone.
I gathered you all here because I wanted to let you know how my research has been going.

Shuji Ikutsuki
It concerns the Shadows that have been appearing during full moons.
Now, I want you to listen closely. It might be hard to follow.
Shadows can be divided into twelve categories, according to their characteristics.
This, we've known for a while. We can think of it like their class or order.
Surprised - I've classified the special Shadows we've seen so far and, well, it's simply fascinating!

Junpei Iori
Wh-Why're you so excited about it...?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - So...?

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Ah, right.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Those four Shadows belonged to Categories I through IV, in order of their appearance!
They may have looked different than the more common ones, but the classification scheme still applies.

Junpei Iori
And that's something we should be excited about?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Oh, I get it. There are twelve in all.
Surprised - And eight we haven't seen yet.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Surprised - That's exactly right, Yamagishi-kun! You're quite sharp.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Oh, uh, okay. But, what are they after?

Shuji Ikutsuki
Surprised - That's a good question, and that's what we haven't figured out yet: their motive.
Surprised - They don't kill their prey; they feed on their minds.
Surprised - Now, it could be considered predation, but is it really? Is there actually an underlying intent behind their behavior?
Surprised - The purpose of the Shadows as a whole... That's what we need to consider.

Akihiko Sanada
This is interesting.
But no matter what their intent, we still have to beat the rest of 'em.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I agree.
That's about all we can do at this point.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Eight more, huh? Lucky us.

Fuuka Yamagishi
According to the data, each one has been stronger than the last. That means we better start training harder.

Akihiko Sanada
We'll manage. We've got plenty of time.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - But why does Tartarus even exist in the first place...?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - ......

Yukari Takeba
......

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The puzzle pieces are falling
into place, one by one...
Those large Shadows that only
appear on the full moon...
I wonder what their purpose is...
......
Eight more remain...
We have a long road ahead of us.

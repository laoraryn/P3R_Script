Junpei Iori
Surprised - ...Wait, whoa! Your hand!
Surprised - What the hell happened!? You're bleeding!

Girl in a Dress
Angry - What's wrong with you!? Can't you mind your own business!?

Junpei Iori
Angry - Are you kidding? I can't just ignore that!
Sad - Um... Gotta have something...
Sad - Gimme your hand! I can wrap it up with this handkerchief.

Girl in a Dress
Sad - Why are you panicking?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Huh? Who wouldn't be freakin' out right now?
Sad - You gotta get to a doctor! Uh, do you want me to go with you?

Girl in a Dress
......
...You're a weird one.

Girl in a Dress
Chidori.

Junpei Iori
Huh?

Chidori
My name. You asked, didn't you, Junpei?

Chidori
...I'm almost finished with the drawing.
I doubt you'll be able to understand it... But if you want to see it so badly, then you know where to find me.

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right. It looks like everyone's here now.

Yukari Takeba
Well, it's been a week. What's our plan?
You okay, Fuuka?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Y-You're just so calm, Yukari-chan.

Yukari Takeba
I mean, panicking's not gonna solve anything.
Besides, it's been such a drag around here all week, and no one'll go to Tartarus.

Mitsuru Kirijo
You're absolutely right.
We humans are quite resilient. With enough time, we can adapt to any situation.
So, how about it, everyone? It's time we discussed this.

Junpei Iori
Looking away - ......

Ken Amada
Have you made up your mind, Sanada-san?

Akihiko Sanada
No.
Angry - But I don't plan on running away.

Mitsuru Kirijo
So you're going to fight Nyx?

Akihiko Sanada
I don't know. I mean, it supposedly can't be defeated.
What about you? What are your thoughts on it?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Honestly, this is the first time I've ever really contemplated my own death.
Sad - In any case, we have to choose one way or the other.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I obviously don't want to suffer. But that means we'd have to take a life.
Not to mention we die no matter what we do.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Then, do we all agree that we don't want to hurt Ryoji-kun?

Akihiko Sanada
Is that how you feel?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - M-Me? Um...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - That's fair. I mean, it's not exactly normal to pick how you're gonna die.

Yukari Takeba
What about you, Junpei? Have you decided?

Junpei Iori
Sad - Nah...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - What's the matter? Scared?

Junpei Iori
Angry - What the hell is wrong with you? You think this is a joke?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Junpei, I...

Junpei Iori
Angry - This is death we're talking about here! Of course I'm scared!
Angry - And here you all are just chattin' it up like it's a goddamn picnic! Can't you see we're all gonna die!?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Then what do you think we should do?
Do you want to kill him?

Junpei Iori
Looking away - There's nothing I can do. He's the only one who can kill him.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Hey, Minato...
Sad - ......
Sad - This whole thing is your fault.

Junpei Iori
Angry - You had that thing inside you and didn't even know it.
Angry - You raised it, dammit! If it weren't for you, none of this would've happened!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Junpei!

Yukari Takeba
[cut 3 2 0]

Junpei Iori
Angry - You're supposed to be "special," right!? Then do something about it!

Minato Arisato - Selection
It's not my fault.
There's nothing I can do.
I'm not running from this.
I'm scared, too.

Yukari Takeba
Very angry* - Stop it, Junpei! It's not his fault!
Very angry* - And the only reason we even have a choice is because he carried it!

Junpei Iori
Looking away - Goddammit, I know! It's just...
Looking away - It doesn't matter how many times I tell myself.

Junpei Iori
Looking away - I know this doesn't fix anything, and it scares the hell out of me!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - I know how you feel, Junpei-kun.

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - We're all scared. I'm scared, too.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Me too.
Sad - I've never felt so cornered in my life. I can't stop shaking...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Same here. We're all in the same boat.
Sad - And hey, I'm sorry for teasing you earlier.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I just... don't want to forget everything.
Sad - I've learned so much since coming here.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Yuka-tan...
Sad - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell at you like that.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I don't think any of us can blame you right now, Junpei.

Yukari Takeba
So don't worry about it. Right, Arisato-kun?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, it's fine.
Nobody's to blame.
I'm sorry...

Junpei Iori
Sad - ...I'm sorry.
Sad - I knew the truth deep down, but still.
Sad - Sorry for being a dick.

Junpei Iori
Sad - You got nothin' to be sorry for.
Sad - I knew the truth deep down, but still.
Sad - Sorry for being a dick.

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right, let's put a pause on any unnecessary gatherings for now.
Ryoji said he'll be back on New Year's Eve. Let's just try to go about our lives until then.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - We have some time, so let's consider our options while we still can.

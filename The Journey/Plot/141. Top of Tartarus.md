So this is the top...   
   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Look at that! In the sky!   
   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh no...!   
   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Nyx!?   
   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There's no mistaking its power...   
Even without my Persona...   
   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I-I've never encountered anything like it before...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Aigis   
You...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Huh!? Ryoji-kun...!?

That was my name for a time...   
I almost miss it.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - What's going on? Wait, could you be...?   
   
Nyx Avatar   
I am merely a harbinger of the Fall... Or perhaps I should say "former" harbinger.   
There is no longer a distinction to be made between Nyx and myself...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I see. So, this is your purpose.   
Angry - Still, I don't regret my decision. We're taking you down, no matter what you are!   
   
Nyx Avatar   
I see... Then, you must already understand.   
What people fear the most... What they try to turn away from...   
That is the wretched thing I have become.   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - We know that.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Scheming - Yeah... We're ready.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - It's the one absolute for all living things.   
   
Nyx Avatar   
Then, you must also understand that it is futile to resist.   
Will you still face me? Surely there must be fear in your hearts.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Yeah, of course I'm scared...   
Angry - But who gives a shit!? I've got too much to live for!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - I'm sick of running away!   
Angry - Living means looking death square in the face...   
Very angry* - So I won't back down... Not even from you!   
   
Aigis   
Angry - Even if I have to sacrifice myself, I will stop you. This is my choice!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's go, everyone.   
This is our answer.

...I see.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - Get ready, everyone!   
Very angry* - Nyx is attacking!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - I'm also sensing multiple Shadows approaching from the lower floors!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - Standby team, intercept those Shadows!   
Angry - This is the final battle...   
Very angry* - Victory at all costs!

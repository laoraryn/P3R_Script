Junpei Iori   
Oh!   
   
   
Junpei Iori   
What the... hell...?   
   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Junpei-kun!   
   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Junpei!   
   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It's her Persona...   
Does it have the power to bestow life?   
   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I don't believe it...   
She brought him back from the dead?   
   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
But wait, if she goes as far as   
completely reviving someone...   
   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The cost for that would be...!   
   
   
Junpei Iori   
Chidori!   
   
   
Chidori   
So it worked...   
   
   
Chidori   
I can hear you...   
   
   
Chidori   
The sound of... your beating heart...   
   
   
Chidori   
Ba-dump... Ba-dump... Hehe...   
   
   
Chidori   
That's all I needed to know...   
Now I can go on living... in you...   
   
Chidori   
I'll always be with you...   
   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh...?   
   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, Chidori... Stay with me!   
   
   
Junpei Iori   
The hell're you even talkin' about!? Hey!   
   
   
Chidori   
This is how it has to be... But don't worry...   
   
   
Chidori   
I'll protect you, Junpei... Always...   
   
   
Junpei Iori   
Y-Yeah... Same. I've got your back!   
   
   
Junpei Iori   
I'll do everything I can to protect you!   
   
   
Junpei Iori   
So come on!   
   
   
Chidori   
Hehe...   
   
   
Chidori   
This might... be all I ever needed...   
   
   
Chidori   
Just being in each other's arms... It's nice...   
   
   
Junpei Iori   
Chidori!   
   
   
Chidori   
I love you... Junpei...   
   
   
Chidori   
Thank... you...   
   
   
Junpei Iori   
...!?   
   
   
Junpei Iori   
Chi...dori...?   
   
   
Junpei Iori   
You're kidding, right?   
   
   
Junpei Iori   
Chidori...   
   
   
Junpei Iori   
Say something, please!   
   
   
Junpei Iori   
CHIDORI!   
   
   
Junpei Iori   
AAAAAAAAAAH!   
   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Takaya   
Pitiful. Such a meaningless end.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Meaningless!?   
   
Takaya   
Hm?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Very angry* - Aaaagh!   
   
Junpei Iori   
[cut 3 2 0]   
   
Junpei Iori   
Very angry* - Aaaaaarrrggghhh!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The resolution in Junpei's heart has awakened a new Persona...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Junpei's Persona, **Hermes**, became one with Chidori's Persona, **Medea**...   
They gave rise to a new power, **Trismegistus**!   
   
Takaya   
Surprised - Wha—!?   
   
Jin   
Angry - Medea!?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Very angry* - Burn in Hell!   
   
Jin   
Hurt - Gah!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - You won't get away with... Gah!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Junpei!   
   
Takaya   
Angry - My... That was quite a spectacle. Now, allow me to respond in kind.   
   
Jin   
Angry - Takaya, don't.   
Angry - Don't forget about your mission. You don't gotta waste any more time on 'em.   
   
Takaya   
......   
I have a much greater purpose to fulfill.   
And since you have no means of destroying the Dark Hour, there's no point in dealing with you any longer.   
Enjoy squandering what little time you have left.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Upset - Get back here!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very angry* - Junpei!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Upset - Let me go! I'll—   
   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Very angry* - She entrusted you with this life!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Don't just... throw it away.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Looking away - ......   
   
Junpei Iori   
Looking away - Chidori...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Looking away - Chidori, I... I...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Looking away - God, this is so hard.   
Looking away - But...   
Looking away - It's not just my life anymore.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - Junpei...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
......   
Everyone was silent as we walked   
back to the dorm together...   
No one could find the right   
words to say to Junpei...   
......

Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Ryoji has returned, as promised...   
It's time for me to make my decision.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Hey, it's been a while.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Midnight's just around the corner.   
Looking away - When it hits, I'll lose this form, and I won't be me anymore.   
Sad - So, have you made a decision?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Then I'll be waiting in his room until midnight.   
Sad - Come see me when you have your answer.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Ryoji-kun...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Oh, and one more thing.   
Don't let the fact that you have to kill me influence your decision.   
Like I said, I'm gonna disappear either way.   
I don't have any hangups about dying.   
So you don't need to worry about me.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - ......   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - All right, I'll be waiting.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Have you made your decision?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I have.   
......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...I see.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's all right, you don't need to say anything.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Have the rest of you decided?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
No need to ask me.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You know how I feel.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - I wouldn't be here if I wasn't on board.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm with the rest of you.   
   
Ken Amada   
I'm on board, too.   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Woof!   
   
Aigis   
Happy - I've made my decision as well.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Sounds like we're all on the same page.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Better let him know, then.   
Okay?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Hey.   
Happy - It's been a long time since we talked like this in your room.   
Happy - Though back then, I had a different form and a different name.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Though back then, I had a different form and a different name.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - It seems like you all decided to let me live.   
Sad - You're all going to risk your lives on a battle you can't win.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
But they're not the ones here right now—you are.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Angry - I'll say this one more time.   
Angry - If you kill me, Tartarus, the Dark Hour, and the memories of your battles will all disappear.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Angry - Tomorrow, you'll wake up as a normal high school student.   
Angry - You'll be able to live in peace until the moment of the Fall.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Angry - But if you let me live, you'll spend every waking moment until that day dreading your inevitable death.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Angry - Nyx can't be defeated. It's pointless to fight her.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - ...Are you still thinking?   
Sad - Or have you already made up your mind?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
......   
My decision determines **the rest of our lives**.   
I must choose wisely.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Spare Ryoji and stay as is   
Kill Ryoji and forget everything   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - So, then. You understand.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
I think looking to the future is a great way to live.   
But that doesn't mean other ways of living are wrong.   
Sad - No one knows which road will lead to happiness.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - I'm really glad I met you.   
Happy - This must be what it's like to... feel happy.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
[cut 221 10 1]   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Thank you. For everything.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Angry - I guess I wasn't able to change your mind.   
Angry - There's still some time until midnight.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - I didn't want to have to show you this... But I have no choice.   
   
Transformed Ryoji   
Do you see? I am not human.   
I will bring death to this world until I am finally satiated.   
There is no need to hesitate over killing me.   
   
Transformed Ryoji   
Now consider this very carefully.   
Is confronting Nyx really what everyone wants?   
Some things in this world cannot be changed. That's something you can't comprehend.   
Memories are not set in stone. Old ones can be replaced with new ones, creating a new reality.   
Don't you think you should put a stop to everyone's pain and suffering?   
It's up to you. Only you can make this decision.   
Now... this is your last chance.   
Tell me your answer.   
   
Transformed Ryoji   
Please kill me, Minato.   
More than anything, I don't want to see you suffer.   
After all, you're someone very special to me.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I have to make my decision now.   
My answer is...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Spare Ryoji and stay as is   
Kill Ryoji and forget everything   
   
Transformed Ryoji   
......   
......   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Looking away - I understand.   
Sad - As sad as I am to hear it, it's your life. You're free to do what you want with it.   
I'll respect your decision.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Let's get back to the others.   
I need to tell you guys how to confront Nyx.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - ......   
Sad - Somehow, I knew that's what you'd choose.   
Sad - I know you better than anyone, after all.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - I have this feeling like... I always wanted to see you again.   
Sad - That's why I came back to you as Ryoji Mochizuki.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Maybe there really is some power out there that can do the impossible.   
Happy - And if there is, I know you all have it.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Oh, right. Here. I want you to have this.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - I know this isn't exactly the best timing, but I never thought I'd feel this way.   
Happy - Whenever you play this music box...   
Happy - I hope that... you'll remember me.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Come on, let's go. Everyone's waiting.   
   
SYS_025_0_0   
You have forged a powerful bond with Ryoji! You can now fuse **Saturnus**, the black sun!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Yo! What's up, Ryoji?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - ......   
Sad - It's a painful decision, but it's yours to make.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - That's right.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - But... it's impossible to defeat Nyx.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We'll go as far as we can. We have to try.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - You're the only one saying it's impossible. Personally, I don't care if it is.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
...All right, then.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
It's almost midnight, so I'll make this short.   
I should tell you where to find Nyx.   
She's at the very top of Tartarus.   
On the Promised Day, you have to make your way to the top of the tower.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - The Promised Day?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
It's exactly one month from tomorrow.   
January 31st, 2010.   
On that day, Nyx will descend to Tartarus.   
And that's when the **world will end**.   
   
Junpei Iori   
One month...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Tartarus is a gigantic rift in the night sky. It acts as a beacon to guide Nyx.   
With the Appriser's arrival, Nyx learns that the way has been prepared, and she begins her descent.   
And with her, she brings the demise.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That explains why it's called the Tower of Demise.   
So what you're saying is we can fight Nyx if we reach the top?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
That's right.   
But remember...   
After today, you'll be fighting against eternal despair.   
I've said it before, but Nyx can't be defeated.   
When you come face to face with her, you'll finally understand why.   
And then you'll realize exactly what you're trying to stand against.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We understand. You don't need to keep telling us.   
One month from now—January 31st. We won't forget.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Well, I'll be going, then.   
Looking away - I want to leave you while I'm still in this form.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Ryoji-kun...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - ......   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Aigis... I'm sorry for all the pain and suffering I put you through.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - I won't forget that you were my enemy... and my friend.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Aigis...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Thank you.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
This is probably the last time we'll get to see each other like this.   
But I'll always be watching over you.   
Well... so long, then.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Best wishes in the coming year.   
Happy - That's what you say on New Year's Eve, right?   
Happy - See ya!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Heh, that punk...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We have one month until January 31st.   
We'll get through this together.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I've made an important decision   
together with my friends.   
I feel an unbreakable bond with them...   
   
SYS_027_0_0   
The Fool Social Link reached its maximum level! You can now fuse **Susano-o**, the raging god!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
We all share the same goal...   
Our relationship has grown stronger. Now   
the team is even more united than ever.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
A new year is about to begin...   
In one month, on January 31st,   
we will face Nyx.   
We must reach the top of Tartarus by then.   
This is what we've all decided.   
......   
2009 is quietly drawing to a close.   
It was a year filled with many memories...

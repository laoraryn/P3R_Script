Shinjiro Aragaki
You just don't know when to give up, do ya?

Akihiko Sanada
I'll come back as many times as I need to. I don't give up that easy.

Shinjiro Aragaki
And my answer will be the same every time: I'm not going back.

Akihiko Sanada
Actually, we got a new team member. Did you know animals can use Personas too?

Shinjiro Aragaki
...Wait, what'd you just say?

Akihiko Sanada
He's a dog. He lost his master to the Shadows six months ago.
And he's incredibly loyal too... Up until now, he's been guarding the spot where his master was killed.
It's been rough for him, but he's making the most of it.

Shinjiro Aragaki
......

Ken Amada
Huh? Oh, it's Sanada-san.
...?
Who's he talking to? I wouldn't want to butt in...

Akihiko Sanada
We saw someone die right before our eyes, too...
It'll be two years, this October...

Shinjiro Aragaki
......

Akihiko Sanada
How long are you gonna beat yourself up over that?
That's why you're always behind the station, even though you don't actually hang out with anyone there.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Doesn't matter.
It was my fault, and nothing's ever gonna change that.
What does it matter if I come to terms with it? It won't change the past.
Sad - This isn't like it was with your sister... What happened to Miki was different.

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - Shinji...

Shinjiro Aragaki
It's over now.
I just want to forget it ever happened.

Ken Amada
Surprised - Two years ago...?
Surprised - ......

Ken Amada
[cut 8 4 1]

Ken Amada
Surprised - No way...

Ken Amada
It's him.
So his name is Shinji...

Teacher   
All right, Odagiri, I'm counting on you. For both our sakes.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
I understand.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Oh, Arisato-san...   
   
Secretary   
Hey, Odagiri! What was that about? What did he mean by "for both our sakes"?   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
He just wants to create a better school environment, so he simply asked a student fit for the job.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Just like how the president asked him to join the student council to help out.   
   
Secretary   
What!? You can't decide something like that without talking to the president first!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What happened?   
No need to fight.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Someone found a cigarette butt in the boys' bathroom.   
Sad - And that teacher wants the disciplinary committee to look into whose it was.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Someone has broken school rules. It's only natural that I'm involved in finding and holding the transgressor accountable.   
   
Secretary   
I wouldn't be so nonchalant about this if I were you, Arisato.   
   
Secretary   
There was a cigarette found in the boys' bathroom... And in his eyes it doesn't matter if it's you or me. We're all suspects!   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Angry - Quite the exaggeration. I'm not a crime scene investigator. I'm a member of the disciplinary committee.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Look, you have two choices. Either help out and prove you can be trusted, or refuse and prove you can't.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Sad - People like you and me have to deal with a lot of crap around here, don't we, Arisato-kun?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Odagiri seems to have   
high expectations of me.   
I feel like we're becoming better friends.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Well then, I'll be excusing myself.   
   
Secretary   
H-Hey! Don't ignore me! You kiss-ass!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Student council members shouldn't be fighting like this, should they?   
Sad - I better go tell the president!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
My work is done here, so I'll head home.

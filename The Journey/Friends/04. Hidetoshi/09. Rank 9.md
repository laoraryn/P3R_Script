...And that concludes the disciplinary committee's forecast report.

(SE) Vice President
Next up is the treasurer's report.

(SE) Chihiro Fushimi
Yes.

Hidetoshi Odagiri
Hey, sorry, but I was hoping you had some time once this meeting's over.
We can talk up on the roof.

===============================================================================================

Hidetoshi Odagiri
I'm sorry to drag you up here, but I wanted to tell you something.
The cigarette butt incident is going to be dropped. It seems interrogating every student in the school raised a few concerns.
I wanted to be student council president next year, and that teacher promised to endorse me if I agreed to help him.

Hidetoshi Odagiri
Sad - But I lost any hope of achieving that when I spoke up against him, not to mention the student body isn't so fond of me.
Sad - I rambled on about rules and fairness, but all I really proved was that I was desperate for power.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Don't blame yourself.
What matters is you realized it.

Hidetoshi Odagiri
......
Now I understand why the president asked you to join the student council.
You aren't just feeding me sympathy or empty words. You genuinely mean what you say.

Hidetoshi Odagiri
I see...
Now I understand why the president asked you to join the student council.
You don't say things to put people down. You're just honest with them.

Hidetoshi Odagiri
Looking away - The system only works if you have people's trust, and trust isn't something you can force on anyone.

Hidetoshi Odagiri
Angry - When that teacher doubted you, I felt backed into a corner by a fool who simply had more power than I did.
Angry - I felt like the truth was being distorted and that I might lose a friend as a consequence.
If it wasn't for you, I would've become a tyrant. So thank you.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Odagiri seems truly grateful.
I feel like we're becoming better friends.

Hidetoshi Odagiri
Sad - Don't you dare repeat what I just said to anyone.
Sad - I realize it's out of my usual character. And I'm sure everyone would just make fun of me.
J-Just promise, okay? I'll see you later.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I parted ways with Odagiri
and went back to the dorm.

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - Arisato-san... Today's meeting is canceled.
Sad - Um, did Odagiri-san do something?

Minato Arisato - Selection
What do you mean?
Why? Is something wrong?

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - A teacher came by earlier and called him to the faculty office.
Sad - That teacher seemed really upset...

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - He was called to the faculty office by a teacher earlier.
Sad - I think it's about that cigarette butt...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Did something happen?
I better head to the faculty office.

Male Teacher's Voice
Don't be so stubborn! All you have to do is write his name on the list!

Odagiri's Voice
Arisato-kun was appointed to the student council by the president herself. He's a responsible person.
That's why I didn't add him to the suspect list.

Male Teacher's Voice
You know there are witnesses who've seen him wandering the streets late at night, don't you?
I thought you hated students who don't follow the rules.

Odagiri's Voice
It's not that I doubt the witness reports.
It's more that I trust Arisato-kun. So I'm not adding him to the list.

Male Teacher's Voice
Odagiri... I really thought you were smarter than this.
You can go ahead and forget about our deal.

Odagiri's Voice
...If you'll excuse me, then.

Hidetoshi Odagiri
Sad - ...So, you heard all that.

Minato Arisato - Selection
It wasn't me.
You stood up for me?

Hidetoshi Odagiri
Happy - I know. You don't have to convince me.

Hidetoshi Odagiri
Happy - Maybe it sounded that way, but all I did was say how I really felt.

Hidetoshi Odagiri
Angry - That teacher suspects you of all people. How he ever got certified is a mystery to me.

Hidetoshi Odagiri
Don't worry, Arisato-kun. Even if the whole school turns on me, I'll have your back.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Odagiri seems to care about me a lot.
I feel like we're becoming better friends.

Hidetoshi Odagiri
"I'll have your back"... You're starting to rub off on me.

Hidetoshi Odagiri
See you later, Arisato-kun.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I parted ways with Odagiri
and went back to the dorm.

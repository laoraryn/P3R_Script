Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Sorry you went out of your way to stop by, but it was a quick meeting. Everyone left already.   
It's nice not having those hyenas around.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You're not going home yet?   
"It's nice"?   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
There's something I want to take care of before I go home.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Sad - It's that cigarette butt in the boys' bathroom. I have to hurry and narrow down my suspects.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
I see the way they look at me.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Sad - Anyway, it's that cigarette butt in the boys' bathroom. I've been trying to narrow down my potential suspects.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
So as you can see, we can't exactly hold a meeting right now. You can leave if you want.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
But I just got here...   
I think I'll stick around.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
I see...   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
If you're not in a hurry, can you spare a few minutes? I'd like to share something.   
Sad - ......   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
You're probably busy all the time, too. Try taking a break once in a while.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
If you're not in a hurry, can you spare a few minutes? I'd like to share something.   
Sad - Um...   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
A man without position, honor, or education... What does he cling to as he struggles through life?   
"Sincerity," a man once told me.   
Do you want to know what happened to that man?   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Well, a TV anchorwoman was injured on the job while reporting on a story.   
The TV station executives deemed it an "unfortunate accident."   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Angry - But when a magazine caught wind that they were hiding something, the execs threw the writer under the bus.   
Angry - They said it was the writer who covered up the truth. They turned him into a scapegoat.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Sad - And now that man is blacklisted from the TV industry, his life's calling. The same man who taught me the meaning of sincerity...   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Angry - In today's society, the weak are preyed upon by the strong. You can't survive on sincerity alone!   
Angry - As for me, Arisato-kun, I want to lead an organization that fosters strength.   
Angry - And to do that, order is essential if I want to keep those with power in check.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Odagiri spoke with passion.   
His words seem truly heartfelt.   
I feel like we're becoming better friends.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Well, that seems like a good spot to call it a day. Shall we head out together?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I walked part of the way   
home with Odagiri.

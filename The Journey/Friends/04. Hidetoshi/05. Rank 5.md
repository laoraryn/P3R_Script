Hidetoshi Odagiri
Angry - How many times do I have to explain it? It's like I'm talking to a moron.

Vice President
Why would you even accuse me!? The cigarette butt was in the boys' bathroom, right?

Hidetoshi Odagiri
Angry - Then can you prove it wasn't a girl who brought it and left it there?

Secretary
With that logic, this is never gonna end!
I'm done with this. You're on your own.

Hidetoshi Odagiri
Angry - ...Bunch of neanderthals.

Minato Arisato - Selection
They're the worst.
You shouldn't accuse everyone.

Hidetoshi Odagiri
Try not to hold it against them. They think like children—they just can't help it.

Hidetoshi Odagiri
Happy - Sooner or later, they'll see the light. Then I'll earn their trust, and they'll learn to respect me.

Hidetoshi Odagiri
Angry - I hope you're not just giving into peer pressure, Arisato-kun.

Hidetoshi Odagiri
Angry - Don't you see? A well-oiled machine is only as strong as its weakest cog!

Hidetoshi Odagiri
Angry - I don't mean to isolate myself. I'm just remaining detached. Someone always gets hurt in any relationship sooner or later.

Hidetoshi Odagiri
Sad - ...I suppose I've gone on long enough. I apologize.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Odagiri seems embarrassed...
I feel like I understand
him a little better now.

Hidetoshi Odagiri
No point in having a meeting today if no one else is here. Let's go.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I parted ways with Odagiri
and went back to the dorm.

Mitsuru Kirijo   
What are you doing here, Arisato? This is the student council room. You have no business here.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Do you have a minute, Arisato?   
I'm sorry, but I'll need some of your time after school. I have a special request for you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Why me?   
A special request?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I apologize if I'm being abrupt, but I couldn't think of a better person to ask.   
I'll tell you more about it after school. Until then.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sorry to keep you waiting.   
To make a long story short, I'd like you to join student council.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sounds like a lot of work.   
I'm not so sure...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We meet regularly, but I don't expect you to participate every time.   
Just come to the student council room when you can.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's it?   
Why me?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yes, that's it. All I want is for you to be a member.   
Being president is very time-consuming. I'd like to have an ally to support me in the event of an emergency.   
An ally meaning someone who understands my situation. You know what it means to be a leader, so I'm asking you.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Because of your ability to lead.   
Being president is very time-consuming. I'd like to have an ally to support me in the event of an emergency.   
An ally meaning someone who understands my situation. You know what it means to be a leader, so I'm asking you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
All right, I'll do it.   
Fine, I guess...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Excellent, I knew I could count on you.   
...And I've already filed and approved your student council membership on your behalf.   
But you'll have to go to the faculty office on your own to sign everything.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Seems like in order to join the student   
council, **I have to go find Ms. Toriumi**.   
I need to tell her that I'm   
going to **join student council**.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm sorry for making arrangements without your permission, but I hope you understand the position I'm in.   
Once you're ready, come to the student council room. I'll be waiting for you there, Arisato.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Oh, Arisato-kun. What can I do for you?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's about student council...    
Never mind...   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Ah, yes, yes. Kirijo-san filled me in.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
All we need is your signature, so read through this and sign here.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Minato Arisato... All right, looks good.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Happy - You can leave the rest to me. Good luck in student council.   
   
SYS_004_0_0   
You now have access to the student council room.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Sad - Don't tell me you're bored, Arisato-kun. Take advantage of your youth while you still have it.   
Sad - Before you know it, you'll be grown up, you won't have any time for yourself, you'll never settle down with a nice man...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I listened to Ms. Toriumi rant for as   
long as I could before slipping out.

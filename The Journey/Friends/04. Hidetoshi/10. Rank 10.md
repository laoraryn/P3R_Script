...Which is what I believe to be the proper way to wear one's uniform. Please keep these things in consideration.   
I'm not saying everyone should follow this to the letter, so we'll leave it to the discretion of the individual.   
   
Secretary   
Holy crap, did that just come out of his mouth?   
   
Vice President   
I think this is the first time he's cared about anyone else's opinions.   
   
Council Liaison   
Well, at least he's trying.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Thank you, Arisato-kun. I couldn't have done it without you.   
So, how did I do? What'd everyone think?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Not too shabby.   
You were great.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Happy - I'm proud of myself for making an effort at the very least.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Thanks, hearing that takes a huge weight off my shoulders.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
I may have painted a selfish, arrogant portrait of myself to everyone, so I'll have to win back their trust.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Here, look at this.

One of the guys fessed up about the cigarette butt in the boys' bathroom.   
It took a lot of persuasion, but he promised me he'll never smoke again.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
This lighter is proof of that.   
I earned his trust by showing compassion for others, just like you taught me.   
That's why you should be the one to have it.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'll cherish it.   
I guess I'll take it.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Happy - Thanks.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Happy - Please do.

I've spent my whole life looking down on others. Such baseless bravado...   
But you taught me an important lesson, something I'll carry with me forever.   
I don't think I'll ever be anything like you, though.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Odagiri seems embarrassed.   
I feel an unbreakable bond with Odagiri.

The Emperor Social Link reached its maximum level! You can now fuse **Odin**, the storm god!

Do you remember the story I told you about the TV station's writer?   
That man... He's my father.   
I see now that sincerity is important, and I'm proud of myself for understanding that. I also realized what an amazing man my father is.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
It's about time to go.   
Say, Arisato-kun. Do you want to stop by somewhere before we head home?   
Now that I think about it, we've never hung out outside of school before.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I walked home with Odagiri,   
who was in a great mood.

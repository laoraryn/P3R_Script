Initiating correspondence.   
   
   
I had been refraining from engaging in private correspondence, but I have recently attained permission to do so from Mitsuru-san.   
I plan to make use of this new responsibility with some regularity.   
Would you like to walk home together with me?

Good morning.   
   
   
Typing accurately on a small device such as a cellular telephone provides more difficulty than I had anticipated.   
Perhaps I should undergo special training so that I may learn to type as efficiently as Yukari-san.   
In any case, would you like to walk home together today as well?   
   
-----   
   
I have a favor to ask.   
   
   
I apologize for the sudden request.   
I would like to "drop by" somewhere with you today.   
If this is acceptable, I will meet you by your seat after school so that we may leave together.

This is incredible.*kitty*   
   
   
Did you notice the image? Here it is again: *kitty*   
Despite the small number of pixels used and suboptimal resolution of the cell phone screen, it remains clear that the image is depicting a cat. *kitty*   
By the way, I would like to go back together today too. Would you please accompany me?

I apologize if I'm being a nuisance. *kitty*   
However, I hope that you are able to share my fondness for this small image. *kitty**kitty*   
I continue to find it quite magnificent. *kitty**kitty**kitty*   
Regardless, would you like to go back together today? *kitty**kitty**kitty**kitty*

No issues to report.   
   
   
I recently underwent maintenance in preparation for the final battle, and I am pleased to report that no abnormalities were found.   
How about you? How are you doing?

Would you care to go to the rooftop after school?   
I would like to look out over the ocean with you.

There's something that I wish to tell you. Will you please listen to what I have to say?

I would really like to walk home with you today.   
I want to be with you and to stay by your side.

There's something I would like to ask of you. Will you please indulge me?

Hello. *kitty*   
   
   
Are you available after school? There is something I would like to do with you at the dorm. *kitty*   
   
-----   
   
It is Aigis.   
   
   
I will be near your desk after school for easy access should you wish to spend time together.   
   
-----   
   
After school.   
   
   
I would like to be by your side. Is that all right?   
   
-----   
   
Let's go back together.   
   
   
I will see you after school. Please consider walking home with me.   
   
-----   
   
Let's watch a movie.   
   
   
Apparently, the facility near Port Island Station that shows motion pictures specializes in that singular activity.   
I have heard that these "movies" are enhanced by the facility's use of large screens and high quality audio.   
I would like to experience this together with you.

Aigis   
Angry - Ah...   
   
Black Shiba Inu   
Grrrrrr... Bark! Bark!   
   
Brown Cat   
Hisssss!   
   
Aigis   
Minato-san, stay behind me. This could be dangerous.   
They seem very angry.   
   
Aigis   
...You're the ones that I often see at the shrine.   
What's wrong?   
   
Aigis   
...What? Koromaru-san?   
You think we what!?   
   
Aigis   
Angry - Wait! We aren't mistreating Koromaru-san!   
Sad - It's true that he's been helping us in our battles, but—!   
   
Aigis   
Sad - What? No...   
   
Aigis   
Oh, um... These are Koromaru-san's old friends.   
Sad - They doubt our intentions regarding Koromaru-san, since he's been more frequently injured lately.   
Sad - How can we make them understand?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Just try explaining.   
I don't think we can.   
   
Aigis   
This is all a misunderstanding, everyone!   
   
Black Shiba Inu   
Grrrrr...   
   
Brown Cat   
Hissss...!   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Please, don't be angry... Just calm down.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Ah!   
   
Black Shiba Inu   
*yelp*   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Ah...   
Sad - I'm so sorry. My hand is hard...   
   
Black Shiba Inu   
*whine*   
   
Aigis   
Sad - I see...   
Sad - No wonder they're suspicious of me; my body is completely unnatural to them.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - I hope that dog isn't hurt...   
   
Aigis   
Sad - ......   
Sad - I've... been thinking lately.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - No matter how human my heart becomes, my body will always remain a machine...   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Of course, it's obvious when you think about it...   
Sad - But I'm not strong enough to be a weapon, and I'm too stiff to pass as a human.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - There's nowhere I truly belong... I'm neither completely machine, nor quite human...   
Sad - ......   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Maybe so.   
That's not true.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - My newfound emotions are something I should be happy about...   
Sad - But, sometimes... I find myself wishing I could just be an unfeeling machine...   
Sad - I know I'm not making sense...   
   
Aigis   
Sad - But...!   
   
Aigis   
Sad - ......   
Sad - Oh... I'm sorry, Minato-san.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Thank you.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - You're right... Even if I can't quite explain it, I have to be true to myself.   
......   
   
Aigis   
Sorry for bringing all of this up.   
Sad - If I hadn't been created, I never would have met everyone... And that includes you.   
Sad - If I can stay by your side, then nothing should faze me. I know that, but...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I can sense Aigis's faint affection...   
   
Aigis   
I should make sure that Koromaru-san's friends understand our situation.   
Sad - I don't want you to end up in danger again, Minato-san.   
   
Aigis   
I'll see you later... Excuse me.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I parted ways with Aigis and   
went back to the dorm.

"Ninja Wars"...
If the description is accurate, today's screening will have no lack of ninjas.

Aigis
Happy - "Ninjas are every man's fantasy!"
...According to Junpei-san.

Mastermind
Heh heh heh! Once I activate this weapon, the entire country will— Wha!? My men! Wh-Where did they go!?

Shinobi
Your men are taking a little nap...

Mastermind
Wh-Who's there!? Show yourself!

Shinobi
I am a shadow. I approach in silence... and then, I strike.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
...It's an over-the-top action thriller.
We learned about the history of ninjas and
their mind-bending fighting techniques...

Aigis
I have updated my records with valuable information.

Aigis
Ninja is the ultimate status that a man can achieve.
In combat, the power of their body is equivalent to that of highly advanced special weapons.

Aigis
They were trained war machines, with unparalleled fighting skill.
Considering their overwhelming might, I am curious as to why they no longer exist in today's world...

Aigis
......
An ice age?

Aigis
......
The proliferation of the Internet?

Aigis
......
The world may never know.

Aigis
Thank you very much for today.

Aigis
Happy - I learned that the name Hattori Hanzo is actually a title instead of a person's name.
Happy - As such, I shall call you Ninja Hattori-san from now on.

Aigis
......
Happy - That was my attempt at a joke.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I decided to go back to the dorm with Aigis.

Aigis
Happy - The wind is calm today... I don't detect the usual scent of the sea.
......

Aigis
Sad - I'm sorry about the other day.
Sad - I think my heart is growing closer to that of a human...

Aigis
Sad - But because of that... I've realized something.
Sad - The heart and body are inseparable...
Sad - A human heart can only function properly within a human body...

Aigis
Um...
Have you ever come here alone with someone else before, Minato-san...?
Perhaps you gazed out at the view together and spoke quietly...

Aigis
Oh, I didn't mean to pry.
Sad - I was just curious.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sometimes.
I'm doing it now.
No.

Aigis
Sad - I see.
That makes sense. Many people depend on you.

Aigis
Sad - ......

Aigis
What...? But...
I'm only shaped like a human, and besides... I'm a machine.

Aigis
Sad - ......

Aigis
Sad - Is that... because I take up so much of your time?

Aigis
Sad - ......

Aigis
Actually... I've been a little worried.
Sad - At school, I am seen as a human girl.
Sad - I was concerned that if I stayed too close to Minato-san, it could cause a misunderstanding.

Aigis
If that is the case, please tell me right away!
I wouldn't want to prevent you from becoming closer to another person...

Aigis
Sad - ......

Minato Arisato - Selection
I don't mind you being here.
What brought this on?

Aigis
......
The view from up here is beautiful.
That must be why I sometimes see couples alone up here after school.

Aigis
They might be leaning against one another, or embracing...

Aigis
Sad - I never gave it a second thought before, but lately... it pains me to see them.
Sad - I think... I've come to realize that this is the kind of connection I can never have.

Aigis
As my heart grows more and more human, it only becomes clearer how much sets us apart.
Just because my heart is developing doesn't mean I can actually become human...
Sad - I've known this since the beginning, yet...

Aigis
Sad - I'm sorry.
Sad - I lost control of myself again...

Aigis
But I still care about you, and that won't ever change.
Happy - No matter what happens.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Aigis is gazing at me intently...
It seems we've grown closer...

Aigis
Even I find it strange. Why do I feel this way?
Why are you so important to me, Minato-san?

Minato Arisato - Selection
It's love.
Because we're friends.

Aigis
This is... love...?

Aigis
......

Aigis
Oh, so that's it... I finally understand.
I have another wish, one just as important as my desire to live.

Aigis
Sad - But... I know that this is something that I can never have.

Aigis
So this is... friendship...

Aigis
......

Aigis
Oh, so that's it... I finally understand.
I have another wish, one just as precious as my desire to live...
Sad - But, I don't know if it's something a machine like me can be allowed to have...

Aigis
Happy - Let's go home, Minato-san.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We decided to go back
to the dorm together.

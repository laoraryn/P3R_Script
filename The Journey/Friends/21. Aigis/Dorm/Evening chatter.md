Aigis   
These are your lodging quarters?   
Very well, I shall remain by your side at all times.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
She's still far from passing as a human...   
It doesn't look like she understands   
ordinary feelings and conversation yet.   
If she could, I might be able   
to form a bond with her.   
   
Aigis   
Minato-san, I have a question.   
When you attend your institution of schooling, what kind of emotions do you feel?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's fun.   
It's boring.   
Nothing.   
   
Aigis   
Roger that. I will categorize "school" as entertaining.   
   
Aigis   
Is that true?   
From analyzing your facial expression, categorizing "school" as boring is inaccurate.   
   
Aigis   
My apologies, but it is inaccurate to categorize "school" as nothing.   
Why don't we do some counseling? Now, open your mouth wide...   
   
Aigis   
Data regarding the newest resident, KEN AMADA-san, has been logged.   
I am able to communicate with him at any time.   
Please leave it to me.   
   
Aigis   
I have conducted a simulation to predict the outcome.   
First of all, the Lost are a strain on society, since they drain resources but are unable to contribute anything.   
These individuals will also require caretakers, increasing strain on the workforce in other areas of society.   
With fewer and fewer people working, society's growth will plummet.   
Eventually, this country will no longer be able to sustain itself... "The end," as people say.   
   
Aigis   
I will fight with guns during battle.   
However, I am not heavily equipped, and my damage output and accuracy are both average.   
On the flip side, I could say that I am quite stable. I would be a good recommendation for beginners.   
   
Aigis   
I want you to be aware of my strengths and weaknesses.   
I am weak against electric attacks, but second to none when it comes to gun attacks.   
I will riddle any kind of enemy with bullet holes.   
   
Aigis   
I do not understand the canine language, but I can sense the emotions produced by such canines.   
I am able to receive similar images from all living things.   
Unfortunately, it seems humans have lost this ability, since they ended up relying upon verbal communication.   
   
Aigis   
My Persona can be likened to a shield and halberd...   
Not only am I skilled at attacking, I can also acquire various support abilities.   
I will be a valuable ally on the front lines of battle.   
   
Aigis   
There is something you should know regarding my Persona.   
It seems my Persona excels in endurance.   
Basic attacks will do little against me... In other words, I am a "tough guy."   
   
Aigis   
The population of the Lost increases noticeably before a full moon.   
I have reconfirmed my objective to assure we win at any cost, no matter what.   
   
Aigis   
There are four Shadows remaining. Let us do our best next time, too.   
However, the members of Strega also appear to be our enemies.   
Let us remain vigilant and continue taking Shadows down.   
   
Aigis   
I have heard that Koromaru-san's Persona is Cerberus.   
This being appears in Greek mythology as the watchdog of the underworld.   
Considering how Koromaru-san was guarding the shrine alone for quite some time, it suits him perfectly.   
   
Aigis   
Koromaru-san's Persona exhibits a unique characteristic.   
It seems he has two different Theurgies that can be activated.   
This is one of his biggest advantages.   
   
Aigis   
I have learned the meaning of the summer festival. It seems like a very interesting event.   
I am looking forward to equipping the special armor known as a yukata.   
This will be a new experience for me.   
   
Aigis   
The summer festival will be occurring tonight at Naganaki Shrine.   
I will consider this a special security assignment and escort Mitsuru-san there.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
As you can see, no matter what I say, she doesn't listen.   
Please help me out here.   
   
Aigis   
Negative. Operation Summer Festival cannot be aborted.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
*sigh* She really wants to go... Well, I suppose I have no choice in the matter...   
   
Aigis   
The summer festival was an excellent experience.   
The rate at which the "candied cotton" substance expanded exceeded my expectations.   
I would like to make an expedition to the next summer festival as well.   
   
Aigis   
Unlike the large Shadows, it is difficult to determine where Strega will appear next.   
Koromaru-san said that we must be very cautious of them.   
   
Aigis   
In correlation to the rise in temperatures, Junpei-san's requests are also on the rise.   
His requests have mainly centered around topics such as going to buy ice cream and lowering the air conditioner's temperature.   
If this continues, Junpei-san will become a lost cause. I will report this to Mitsuru-san at once.   
   
Aigis   
The frequency at which the Lost appear is a good measure of a Shadow's strength.   
Casualties are currently on the rise, so we must remain ever vigilant.   
We can most likely expect more powerful enemies to appear in the future.   
   
Aigis   
There seems to be a theory that "summer vacation" is a measure to protect students from the heat.   
Despite this, school will resume in September.   
The temperature on August 1st was 29 degrees Celsius. The forecast for September 1st is 31 degrees Celsius...   
Would it not make more sense for summer vacation to be implemented until October?   
   
Aigis   
The agility of Koromaru-san's Persona is part of its charm.   
This is most likely because Koromaru-san is fast himself.   
I now understand why his walks are so rigorous, as well.   
   
Aigis   
During summer vacation, it seems students are subjected to "summer homework."   
From what I have heard, it takes a tremendous amount of mental strength to power through this.   
Thus, it is only natural that people cannot complete it... or so Junpei-san says.   
   
Aigis   
Summer vacation will end soon, and school will resume session.   
This poses a problem...   
I will not be able to stay by your side when you are at school.   
...That is worrisome. What should I do...?   
   
Aigis   
I heard from Amada-san earlier that the spear is his weapon of choice.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh, that's kind of a curveball when you think about standard weapons like swords.   
I wonder why he chose that.   
   
Aigis   
Most likely because of his size.   
A spear makes up for any disadvantage he might have against a taller enemy.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
That makes sense. I'm not surprised Amada-kun would think of that.   
   
Aigis   
Amada-san is small, so he uses a spear with a long reach.   
This enables him to compensate for his small stature and fight bigger enemies.   
Indeed, a spear is the perfect weapon for Amada-san.   
   
Aigis   
One more week until the next full moon... The situation remains unpredictable.   
Please begin making careful preparations now. I will be sure to check all my parts as well.   
   
Aigis   
I have a question, Minato-san. Why can't Koromaru-san attend school?   
I do not understand why I am permitted to go to school while Koromaru-san is not.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Because he's a dog.   
It's common sense.   
I don't know.   
   
Aigis   
Nowhere in the school regulations does it state that canines are prohibited from attending school.   
Even Koromaru-san seemed perplexed about this.   
   
Aigis   
A tacit understanding that is not listed in the school regulations...   
My question has been answered. Thank you very much.   
   
Aigis   
Is it so difficult of a question that no answer can be given?   
Nowhere in the school regulations does it state that canines are prohibited from attending school.   
   
Aigis   
Even though it is nowhere in the school regulations, canines are prohibited from attending school... These regulations are quite perplexing.   
   
Aigis   
Koromaru-san told me something interesting...   
He said the one named Aragaki has been feeding him from time to time.   
   
Aigis   
Junpei-san's current status is extreme happiness.   
I have learned how people describe this state in the modern vernacular...   
"He has gone to La La Land."   
   
Aigis   
Strega member Chidori has been sent to a Kirijo-run hospital...   
Mitsuru-san and Sanada-san are currently on their way there to interrogate her.   
When neither senpai is present, we are not permitted to go to Tartarus.   
   
Aigis   
Koromaru-san would like to communicate something to you.   
He is tired of eating the same food day after day.   
I recommend you change Koromaru-san's menu.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'll think about it.   
I don't think so.   
   
Aigis   
Koromaru-san seems happy to hear that. Thank you.   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Ruff! Ruff!   
   
Aigis   
I see. Koromaru-san, "there, there," as they say.   
   
Koromaru   
Sad - *whine*   
   
Aigis   
Koromaru-san says that he got a very tasty meal from Aragaki-san.   
He was very excited, and mentioned that he'd "won over his stomach." What could have happened to him...? I am concerned.   
   
Aigis   
With Aragaki-san as our ally, we are a much more formidable force.   
This is the ideal time for us to ascend Tartarus.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Seriously. I'd love to keep our momentum going and charge through it.   
   
Aigis   
Aragaki-san used to frequent the outskirts of Port Island Station...   
The only reason he is still alive is because of his knowledge of self-preservation and defense...   
Those skills make him quite a valuable ally in battle.   
   
Aigis   
According to my calculations, the probability of the typhoon descending upon us is extremely high.   
We must secure the dormitory windows and seal any areas prone to leaking.   
   
Aigis   
Due to the cancellation of the festival, we will receive five days off from school.   
We will have the full weekend off. The 21st is Respect for the Aged Day.   
The 22nd is a national holiday, and the 23rd is the autumnal equinox.   
We should use this time wisely.   
   
Aigis   
Good morning. I am here to monitor the condition of your health.   
Your temperature, pulse, and breathing have all returned to normal.   
Congratulations on surviving your illness.   
   
Aigis   
While you were resting, a typhoon passed through town.   
Not much damage was incurred.   
Nothing of note was mentioned about typhoon damages on the news either.   
   
Aigis   
We have captured Strega's support specialist, Chidori.   
Next mission, it is highly probable that they will be unable to determine our location.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, not having a navigator must make a huge difference...   
I doubt they'll be able to do much on their own right now.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Still, we should be careful. The other two must be formidable too...   
   
Aigis   
It is difficult to determine a Shadow's strength.   
Particularly these last three.   
It would be safer and more secure for us to prepare and train accordingly as well.   
   
Aigis   
Three Shadows remain.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Only three more... Our final battle isn't far off...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Dude, why can't they all just come at once? Then we could get it over with.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Uh... You think you can beat 'em if you fight 'em all at once?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh!? Well, obviously...   
...NOT!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
......   
   
Aigis   
The operation will be on October 4th.   
We are well-staffed to fight this time as well, but let us make certain we are fully prepared and emerge victorious.   
   
Aigis   
In order to be victorious, it would be best to start strategizing now.   
Though we may be strong, as they say, "We should not be complacent."   
We will be looking to you so that everyone can fight to the best of our abilities.   
   
Aigis   
My functions cannot address any highly metaphysical issues.   
As I am unlikely to be of any assistance, I will stand by until further notice.   
   
Aigis   
I have confirmed the metamorphosis of two Personas, most likely the result of Aragaki-san's death.   
There may be more changes to come, so I will remain in observation mode.   
   
Aigis   
Koromaru-san says that he is in good spirits.   
If anything, he seems to greatly respect Aragaki-san.   
   
Aigis   
I have confirmed that everyone's spirits are low, due to Aragaki-san's incident.   
If this persists, the outlook for our next mission will be poor.   
We must forge ahead.   
   
Aigis   
These will be my first periodic examinations.   
Since I have a human mind, my memory is similar to that of a human being's.   
Thus, I will not be able to insert the data of an entire book into my memory system.   
However, do not worry. I will still do my very best.   
   
Aigis   
The exams start tomorrow... It looks like you are all serious about doing well on them.   
I, too, will be implementing the "take my chances" approach on where to focus reviewing my studies.   
   
Aigis   
My favorite subjects are tactical theory, mechanical engineering, and information analysis...   
Unfortunately, the examinations did not cover these subjects.   
Therefore, regarding the results of the exams, I will be, as Junpei-san would put it, "in deep shit."   
   
Aigis   
What to do after the Dark Hour disappears...? I cannot answer that question.   
I was built solely to eliminate Shadows.   
Once that mission has been fulfilled, there is no reason for me to remain active.   
Thus, the disappearance of the Dark Hour does not concern me.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Dude, Aigis...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You didn't have to put it that way... It's kinda depressing to hear you say that.   
   
Aigis   
I performed satisfactorily in chemistry and mathematics, but I performed poorly in other subjects.   
But since I specialize in combat, these results are not unexpected.   
   
Aigis   
When cornered, an enemy will fight even more fiercely... This is a basic premise of warfare.   
Only one Shadow remains. We should expect the same principle to apply here as well...   
I am sure that this will be the toughest battle of all.   
Please make sure that you are fully prepared so that we do not experience an unfortunate defeat.   
   
Aigis   
When Sanada-san began his run, I analyzed his time, distance, and energy expended.   
Utilizing the overall results, I prepared an optimal training regimen for him.   
He was so pleased with my suggestions that he intends to incorporate them into his regimen.   
I was delighted to have been of service to him.   
   
Aigis   
The lowered morale due to Aragaki-san's departure had been quite concerning...   
However, everyone seems to be cherishing their lives much more than they did before.   
Aragaki-san's departure seems to have helped everyone grow and mature.   
   
Aigis   
It seems that Koromaru-san is able to sense the change in everyone's demeanor as well.   
Our battle against the Shadows is coming to an end...   
He understands that the time has come to avenge his former owner in the upcoming operation.   
   
Aigis   
I cannot understand the nervousness you all are feeling.   
But I can sense that everyone will be giving their all in this battle...   
Therefore, I will do everything in my power to assist you up to the very end.   
This will most likely be the last time we fight together, so let us leave no room for regrets.   
   
Aigis   
Even though Ikutsuki is "cracking jokes," nobody is paying him any mind.   
In fact, my mental facilities also have no room to spare to decrypt his jokes.   
They are already occupied with other thoughts...   
Of the last Shadow... the Dark Hour... and the Lost.   
   
Aigis   
...I am truly sorry.   
Even though he took control of me, I cannot believe I did such a thing to you...   
Could you ever forgive me?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Of course.   
Fine...   
   
Aigis   
...Thank you.   
I will continue to do what I can to help.   
   
Aigis   
Thank you so much...   
I will train hard so that I can be of great help to you.   
   
Aigis   
I will do everything I can so that I may be of great help to you all.   
   
Aigis   
I will follow everyone's example and refer to that man as "Ikutsuki" from now on as well.   
Ikutsuki never mentioned anything about his plot, even when we were alone.   
Meaning, he completely hid his true nature. It is truly an extraordinary feat.   
This clearly illustrates how unique his psychological state was.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You're right... The more time I spend thinking about it, the more frightening it seems.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
And all this time, we never suspected a thing...   
Ugh... It makes me sick.   
   
Aigis   
Be careful of Ryoji-san...   
There is something about him...   
I don't know exactly what, though.   
   
Aigis   
Mitsuru-san appears to be extremely fatigued.   
Sad - I believe it would be wise to "leave her be" for now.   
   
Aigis   
I have thought long and hard about Ryoji-san...   
Though I still don't know exactly what is so unsettling about him...   
I want you to remain cautious around him.   
   
Aigis   
I am unable to comprehend the significance of a "trip."   
I thought that it was simply an activity to experience, but it seems to be more complex than that.   
What do you obtain when you go on a "trip"?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Memories.   
It's hard to explain.   
   
Aigis   
Memories...   
How do you benefit from gaining memories?   
This matter is indeed difficult to comprehend...   
   
Aigis   
That is the biggest difference between us.   
I am always able to explain the motives of my actions...   
   
Aigis   
I understand how important a school trip is for everyone...   
I thought that this trip was simply a means for temporary peace of mind... In other words, comfort.   
However, it is something more meaningful that will boost morale for future battles, is it not?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Th-That might be a bit of an exaggeration... But I do hope everyone enjoys this trip.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I hope so, too, but it's hard to have fun when literally everything else is on my mind...   
...I wonder when we'll be able to figure out how to move forward.   
   
Aigis   
What is the matter, Minato-san? You seem anxious when the girls are around.   
I speculate that you are concealing a serious matter from the girls.   
   
Aigis   
You are unscrupulous.   
As a penalty, I shall not converse with you for the rest of the day.   
Commencing ignore mode.   
   
Aigis   
I cannot stop thinking about Ryoji-san. I am worried I may overheat.   
I even asked Koromaru-san for help...   
   
Aigis   
Career experience appears to be routine labor that is performed over and over again.   
Though that does not bother me...   
Everyone else seems to despise it.   
   
Aigis   
The top priority of all living beings is the preservation of their own lives.   
Even if one tries to give up their life for another, this instinct is likely to be a limiting factor.   
Despite this, Chidori-san really did give up her life force to Junpei-san.   
The connection between them must have been special enough to transcend even her most basic instincts.   
   
Aigis   
Oh, welcome back. How was your career experience?   
I performed routine labor, over and over again.   
   
Aigis   
The recovery of Junpei-san's mental health has been confirmed.   
Wait, did that sound strange? Let me try again...   
I have confirmed that Junpei-san's mental state has returned to normal.   
   
Aigis   
I wonder why I can't stop thinking about Ryoji-san...   
Koromaru-san has no idea, either...   
   
Aigis   
Ryoji-san is dangerous... I'm certain of it.   
Things are fine for now, but one day that will change.   
Please do not worry, though. I will be there to protect you.   
   
Aigis   
Minato-san... I swear that I will protect you, come what may.   
So, um... please do your best on your exams.   
   
Aigis   
Now I know why I'm here.   
My destination lies in the decision we make.   
Let's choose wisely.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Let's face this together, Minato-san.   
   
Aigis   
I never used to understand the significance of a new year...   
Dates and times were nothing but data to me.   
But with all that has happened, I'm starting to realize the meaning behind this custom.   
It's a time to leave behind the past, and look forward to the future.   
Yes... Anything is possible in the new year.   
   
Aigis   
When the cult assembled, they didn't seem to do anything in particular... It was just a gathering.   
Of course, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. I'd say it's preferable to a violent rampage...   
But the fact they did nothing at all is rather eerie as well...   
   
Aigis   
I will stand beside you until the very end.   
Even though I only have this one month to spend with you...   
...I will have no regrets.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Don't talk like that, Aigis...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Let her say her piece, Yukari. After all, the chances that we manage to defeat Nyx are slim...   
   
Aigis   
Indeed, that may be true... But there is still a possibility we will win.   
So we must spend our time wisely this month, and attempt to better our odds.   
   
Aigis   
Koromaru-san's gaze is strong and unwavering, as if he is only looking towards the future.   
When he joined us, he was the only one capable of using two different Theurgies.   
Now, I think I understand why.   
By the time Koromaru-san met us, he had already crossed a major milestone...   
   
Aigis   
I didn't expect that cult to become so popular.   
I thought more people would oppose it.   
But it's like a fire drawing moths to its flames... The masses have simply accepted it.   
   
Aigis   
About the cult...   
I wonder how many people truly believe in it.   
It seems that much of the public will openly discuss the end of the world without truly understanding the consequences...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, I think I get what you mean. I've noticed something similar, too.   
Like, some people are just going along with it, saying things like, "I joined the cult 'cause my friend believes in it."   
   
Junpei Iori   
I overheard some folks talkin' the other day, too.   
They said that life was so boring, it wouldn't be so bad if the world ended.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
In other words... they think of the cult as nothing more than a trend.   
It helps people fill the emptiness they feel inside.   
   
Aigis   
I have to admit, it's impressive how well Strega has manipulated the media.   
But I'm a little disappointed in the media for being so easily influenced by them.   
Do you think the media were paid off by Strega to promote them?   
...Actually, that would be even more disappointing.   
   
Aigis   
The media is attempting to sway public opinion by reporting on Strega's activities in a positive light.   
And the most popular queries on the Internet include the keywords "Nyx," "cult," and "end of the world."   
...Do people truly yearn for the Fall, after all?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Maybe...   
No way.   
   
Aigis   
People either have no will to live... or they aren't allowed to have any will to live.   
That's the current state of this society we live in...   
   
Aigis   
But if it's gaining traction, then that must mean people are curious. Why on earth would people be interested in the end of the world?   
Perhaps... some part of humanity longs for the end?   
   
Aigis   
No matter what may happen... I will fight to the very end, ever at your side.   
I won't accept this fate. I'll stand against the Fall.   
   
Aigis   
Koromaru-san is also a proud and splendid teammate.   
If you intend to go to Tartarus, please consider adding him to the combat party. Koromaru-san would be greatly pleased.   
   
Aigis   
The machine that malfunctioned in the command room... The camera...   
Oh, don't mind me. I just realized something...   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Koromaru-san seems very happy.   
Happy - Dogs, too, consume food in order to boost their energy levels.   
Happy - Koromaru-san will certainly be ready for the battle.   
   
Aigis   
It's beautiful how two people care so much about one another.   
   
Aigis   
As an anti-Shadow weapon, I did what was ordered of me.   
There was always someone dictating my actions, my choices.   
So choosing what I want to pursue for my own future will be a new experience for me.   
Though it may be difficult, I'll do my best, so please... do the same, Minato-san.   
   
Aigis   
My current mission is about to come to an end...   
The mission my creator gave me, that is—to destroy all Shadows.   
But, in its place, a new mission has just begun.   
My mission to live in this world...   
I know I can do it, with all of you helping me.   
   
Aigis   
I don't quite understand what it means to "live" yet.   
So my career consultation was really confusing.   
But, I know that if I'm with you, everything will be okay.   
   
Aigis   
It's almost time. How are your preparations coming along?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Right on schedule.   
Not so great...   
   
Aigis   
Good. We need to be fully prepared if we aim to win.   
   
Aigis   
Not to worry. If you double your efforts, you'll be fully prepared in no time.   
Remember, while making preparations is important, in the end what matters the most is never giving up.   
   
Aigis   
I, too, intend to make extra preparations till the very last minute.   
...Let's win this, Minato-san.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Good morning.   
Happy - Everyone seems to be spending today being where they wish to be, doing what they wish to do.   
Happy - I have decided to wait for everyone to return in the meantime.   
   
Aigis   
I want us to get through this—all of us... We must live.   
Happy - That's why I'll continue to fight.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Aigis   
I am very busy at the moment, Minato-san.   
"You should relax during summer vacation"...   
That is what I was told. Thus, I am devoting all available processes to relaxation.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Aigis seems serious...   
I should leave her be.   
   
Aigis   
Minato-san... Achieving relaxation is quite a difficult task.   
Merely standing in one spot does not seem to count as relaxing.   
Today, I am observing everyone's actions so that tomorrow, I might relax in the correct manner.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Aigis seems busy...   
But maybe I could invite her to   
the film festival tomorrow.   
   
Aigis   
There's a meeting tonight.   
I will relax until then.   
Do you have any suggestions on how to relax, Minato-san?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Aigis doesn't seem to be busy...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I invite Aigis to the film festival?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Invite to the movies   
Don't invite   
   
Aigis   
The... movies?   
I see... So going out is considered to be relaxing, too.   
Then let us go and relax.   
   
Aigis   
Good morning, Lord Minato.   
...Just kidding.   
   
Aigis   
Summer vacation will end soon.   
This dorm will become quieter once everyone is back at school.   
......   
I am thinking of ways to remain at your side from September onwards.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Aigis seems serious...   
I should leave her be.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Right now, the Temperance Arcana   
may help me grow even more...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Aigis   
Is there something I can assist you with?   
   
DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_5_0   
Come to think of it, Elizabeth asked   
me to get a specific item for her...   
   
Aigis   
I see, you are looking for oil. That is something I do use regularly.   
I have a large stock of silicone oil. It works well with precision components.   
If you like, you may have some for free, Minato-san. What a steal, as they say.

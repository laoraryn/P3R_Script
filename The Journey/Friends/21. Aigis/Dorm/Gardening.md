Is it correct that you tend to the planters on the rooftop, Minato-san?   
I am interested in attempting horticultural activities as well.   
If such a task is within your purview of operations for the day, would it be acceptable for me to join?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The quality of the produce might improve if   
we tend to the rooftop planters together.   
   
Aigis   
I am both prepared and motivated to undertake this action. Shall we commence gardening?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, let's go.   
Not right now.

Aigis   
Minato-san, you take care of the rooftop planters on occasion, right?   
I am actually somewhat interested in the process of growing plants myself...   
So, um, would it be all right if I accompanied you?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The quality of the produce might improve if   
we tend to the rooftop planters together.   
   
Aigis   
I am ready if you are. Would you like to head to the rooftop?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, let's go.   
Not now.   
   
Aigis   
Minato-san, I would like to suggest maintaining the rooftop garden today.   
The plants are surely awaiting our continued care.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The quality of the produce might improve if

Aigis   
I have further analyzed data on home gardens. Let us proceed to the rooftop.

Minato-san, would you like to go tend to the planters together?   
I don't want to deprive our plants of the care that they need.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The quality of the produce might improve if   
we tend to the rooftop planters together.   
   
Aigis   
I have been practicing how to properly mix fertilizer. I would like to try it out!   
   
Aigis   
Would you find it permissible to visit the rooftop again?   
I believe it is time that we check on the progress of our cultivation efforts.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Aigis seems motivated...   
The quality of the produce might improve if   
we tend to the rooftop planters together.   
Aigis might gain a new ability soon...   
   
Aigis   
I am ready to deploy at any time. Shall we engage, Minato-san?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, let's go.   
Not now.   
   
Aigis

Aigis   
Minato-san, I would like to suggest maintaining the rooftop garden today.   
"Summer break" is a time for experiences that cannot be had at any other time of the year.   
By tending to a garden in high-temperature conditions, you may be able to achieve this.   
   
Aigis   
If you have the time, would you like to go to the rooftop together?   
I think it would be good to check up on our plants again.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Aigis seems motivated...   
The quality of the produce might improve if   
we tend to the rooftop planters together.   
Aigis might gain a new ability soon...   
   
Aigis   
I'm ready whenever. How about you, Minato-san?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, let's go.   
Not now.   
   
Aigis   
Do you intend to continue work on the rooftop planters today?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It doesn't seem like Aigis will gain any   
more skills even if she helps me garden...   
But the quality of the produce might improve   
if we tend to the rooftop planters together.   
   
Aigis   
I am concerned that the vegetation may require additional care.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
All right, let's go.

I have been wondering how our plants are doing lately...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
All right, let's go.   
Not now.   
   
Aigis   
Understood. I will begin making my way to the rooftop with maximum efficiency.   
   
Aigis   
Understood. I will begin making my way to the rooftop with maximum efficiency.   
   
Aigis   
Understood. Then I will remain on standby.   
   
Aigis   
Understood. Then I will remain on standby.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Thank you! Then I will get prepared and head to the rooftop right away.   
   
Aigis   
I see. Then perhaps it would be better if I refrain from going up today as well.   
   
Aigis   
Is your attention preoccupied with the plants as well? Then we are "like-minded," as they say.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It doesn't seem like Aigis will gain any   
more skills even if I garden with her...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I tended the plants with Aigis...   
   
Aigis   
How much longer until they can be harvested?   
   
Aigis   
Size doesn't matter, as long as they grow well.   
   
Aigis   
These bugs... I will target them with the repellant.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Thanks to the care we put in, it   
looks like this will be a big harvest...

===============================================================================================   
   
Aigis   
How very puzzling...   
The plants seem much livelier than they did when we started.   
   
Aigis   
Do you suppose... they're happy that you are tending to them?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I think so.   
That's not possible.   
Why don't you ask?   
   
Aigis   
Fascinating... There's no data on this, but it seems like you understand them.   
Hello, plants. I will be tending to you as well this time. Don't worry, I'll make sure to decrease my pressure output.   
But if anything starts hurting, just raise your left hand... Or rather, your left leaf.   
   
Aigis   
That is what I thought, as well...   
However, some reports suggest that plants grow better when you speak to them.   
Could it be that they have some sort of ability that we aren't yet aware of?   
   
Aigis   
Good idea. I'll give it a try.   
Hello, hello. This is Aigis. If you can hear me, plants, then please respond.   
......   
Unfortunately, there was no answer.   
Communication will be difficult with my current abilities. This is something to consider for the future.   
   
Aigis   
I had some prior knowledge of "plants," but this was my first time observing them directly.   
These little seeds and buds in the earth can morph and change so quickly.   
Is this proof that they are living as well? How fascinating.   
   
Aigis   
I would like to watch these plants grow and document this experience for my records.   
I will tend to them with my full power!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I tended the plants with Aigis...   
   
Aigis   
This took more time than I'd anticipated...   
I will need to run more simulations to ensure there are no delays next time.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Thanks to the care we put in, it   
looks like this will be a big harvest...   
   
Aigis   
It's gotten late. We should head back now.   
   
Aigis   
I've been wondering...   
The plants look much livelier now compared to before they were tended to.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Do you think... they're happy you're taking care of them, Minato-san?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's possible.   
That's not possible.   
Why don't you ask?   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Yes, you handle them so delicately, it's clear that you care about them.   
Happy - I'm sure the plants know how much work you're putting in for them.   
Happy - I'll do the best I can to make them happy too!   
   
Aigis   
I agree... But that's why I find it so strange.   
They say talking to plants can help them grow, don't they?   
Do you think... maybe these plants have a heart as well, but we just aren't aware of it?   
   
Aigis   
Happy - ...It would be nice if that were possible.   
Happy - I wonder... Maybe these plants have a heart as well, but we just aren't aware of it.   
Happy - If we keep tending to them, will we understand them better?   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Looking at them like this really makes me think.   
Happy - These plants are just like you and the others. They're living, too...   
   
Aigis   
Happy - I want to see them grow with my own eyes.   
Happy - So I'm going to do everything in my power to care for them.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I tended the plants with Aigis...   
   
Aigis   
I'm sorry. This was my first time doing this, so I think I slowed you down...   
Happy - I'll keep training in my room so that I can work faster next time.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Thanks to the care we put in, it   
looks like this will be a big harvest...   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Thank you for your help. We should head back now.   
   
Aigis   
There appears to be less damage from pests than the data in my predictions suggests.   
We haven't taken any specific measures against them. What is the cause of this?   
   
Aigis   
Oh? This is...   
Look, Minato-san! I've sighted a ladybug larva! It's very small and adorable.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's get rid of it.   
Just leave it alone.   
Please keep it away from me.   
   
Aigis   
No, we mustn't.   
Ladybugs are the natural predators of pests that damage plants...   
This must be the reason why they've been growing so well.   
   
Aigis   
Agreed. We wouldn't want to interrupt it while it's eating.   
Ladybugs are the natural predators of pests that damage plants...   
That would explain why there weren't any harmful insects around.   
Thank you very much, little ladybug.   
   
Aigis   
You don't look so well. You don't have to worry about it biting you though...   
I will move it to another leaf then.   
......   
...It won't stay still.   
It looks like the ladybug would prefer to be near you, Minato-san.   
   
Aigis   
Even in just these tiny planters, there is so much life...   
There's no one to teach them. They're just doing the best they can...   
......   
   
Aigis   
My apologies, I got distracted. Let's keep working.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I tended the plants with Aigis...   
   
Aigis   
Excuse me, Minato-san. Please apply the repellant on that end.   
Pests deserve no mercy.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Thanks to the care we put in, it looks   
like the plants will grow nicely...   
   
Aigis   
Status reads all green. No problems to report.   
That concludes our mission for today. We should head back now.   
   
Aigis   
There isn't as much damage from pests as I was expecting. That's a relief.   
But we haven't taken any special measures. What's going on...?   
   
Aigis   
Oh? This is...   
Look, Minato-san! There's a ladybug larva! It's so small and adorable.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection

Oh, Minato-san, look over there...   
It may be rude to interfere, but we can't let them ruin our harvest.

Aigis   
Status reads all green. No problems to report.   
That concludes our mission for today. We should head back now.   
   
Aigis   
There isn't as much damage from pests as I was expecting. That's a relief.   
But we haven't taken any special measures. What's going on...?   
   
Aigis   
Oh? This is...   
Look, Minato-san! There's a ladybug larva! It's so small and adorable.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's get rid of it.   
Just leave it alone.   
Please keep it away from me.   
   
Aigis   
No, we can't!   
Ladybugs are the natural predators of pests that damage plants...   
That explains why there weren't any harmful insects around.   
   
Aigis   
Yes. We wouldn't want to interrupt it while it's eating.

Thank you very much, little ladybug.   
   
Aigis   
I'm sorry. Are you uncomfortable with insects? I'll move it to another leaf.   
......   
...It won't stay still.   
It looks like the ladybug would prefer to be near you, Minato-san.   
   
Aigis   
Even in just these tiny planters, there is so much life...   
There's no one to teach them. They're just doing the best they can...   
......   
   
Aigis   
Sorry, I got distracted. Shall we keep going?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I tended the plants with Aigis...   
   
Aigis   
Oh, Minato-san, look over there...   
It may be rude to interfere, but we can't let them ruin our harvest.   
Let's give the ladybug some assistance this time.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts

Aigis   
Status reads all green. I don't see any problems.   
That should be enough for today. Let's head back now.   
   
Aigis   
How very puzzling...   
The plants seem much livelier than they did when we started.   
   
Aigis   
Do you suppose... they're happy that you are tending to them?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I think so.   
That's not possible.   
Why don't you ask?   
   
Aigis   
Fascinating... There's no data on this, but it seems like you understand them.   
Hello, plants. I will be tending to you as well this time. Don't worry, I'll make sure to decrease my pressure output.   
But if anything starts hurting, just raise your left hand... Or rather, your left leaf.   
   
Aigis   
That is what I thought, as well...   
However, some reports suggest that plants grow better when you speak to them.   
Could it be that they have some sort of ability that we aren't yet aware of?   
   
Aigis   
Good idea. I'll give it a try.   
Hello, hello. This is Aigis. If you can hear me, plants, then please respond.   
......   
Unfortunately, there was no answer.   
Communication will be difficult with my current abilities. This is something to consider for the future.   
   
Aigis   
I had some prior knowledge of "plants," but this was my first time observing them directly.   
These little seeds and buds in the earth can morph and change so quickly.   
Is this proof that they are living as well? How fascinating.   
   
Aigis   
I would like to watch these plants grow and document this experience for my records.   
I will tend to them with my full power!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I tended the plants with Aigis...   
   
Aigis   
This took more time than I'd anticipated...   
I will need to run more simulations to ensure there are no delays next time.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Thanks to the care we put in, it   
looks like this will be a big harvest...   
   
Aigis   
It's gotten late. We should head back now.   
   
Aigis   
I've been wondering...   
The plants look much livelier now compared to before they were tended to.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Do you think... they're happy you're taking care of them, Minato-san?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's possible.   
That's not possible.   
Why don't you ask?   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Yes, you handle them so delicately, it's clear that you care about them.   
Happy - I'm sure the plants know how much work you're putting in for them.   
Happy - I'll do the best I can to make them happy too!   
   
Aigis   
I agree... But that's why I find it so strange.   
They say talking to plants can help them grow, don't they?   
Do you think... maybe these plants have a heart as well, but we just aren't aware of it?   
   
Aigis   
Happy - ...It would be nice if that were possible.   
Happy - I wonder... Maybe these plants have a heart as well, but we just aren't aware of it.   
Happy - If we keep tending to them, will we understand them better?   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Looking at them like this really makes me think.   
Happy - These plants are just like you and the others. They're living, too...   
   
Aigis   
Happy - I want to see them grow with my own eyes.   
Happy - So I'm going to do everything in my power to care for them.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I tended the plants with Aigis...   
   
Aigis   
I'm sorry. This was my first time doing this, so I think I slowed you down...   
Happy - I'll keep training in my room so that I can work faster next time.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Thanks to the care we put in, it   
looks like this will be a big harvest...   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Thank you for your help. We should head back now.   
   
Aigis   
There appears to be less damage from pests than the data in my predictions suggests.   
We haven't taken any specific measures against them. What is the cause of this?   
   
Aigis   
Oh? This is...   
Look, Minato-san! I've sighted a ladybug larva! It's very small and adorable.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection

It appears they are growing well. Hip hip hooray, as they say.   
The ladybug has grown into a fine adult as well.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - I believe this is "mission complete." Well done, Minato-san.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's thanks to your help.   
It's too early to relax.   
We aren't growing bugs here...   
   
Aigis   
I tried to do everything in my power. I'm glad I was of service.   
The ladybug put in a lot of work as well. We thank you for your service!   
   
Aigis   
That's true. We must be prepared for surprise attacks.   
That reminds me, Junpei-san came here the other day trying to get some free samples, but I quickly gunned him down.   
If he comes back, rest assured, he will be shot on sight.   
   
Aigis   
But, it's thanks to the ladybug that the plants didn't suffer any significant damage.   
I will thank it for its service in your place, Minato-san!   
   
Aigis   
I've realized something, tending these plants alongside you.   
   
Aigis   
I've made many new discoveries beside these planters.   
Everyone is doing the best they can to make their way in the world.   
That goes for the plants, and the pests, and the ladybug too...   
And you as well, Minato-san.   
   
Aigis   
I may be a machine, but I also want to do the best I can.   
I will do my best to make my way in the world, just like everyone else.   
That is my new goal from now on.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I won't let you beat me.   
I don't get it.   
   
Aigis   
I am impressed, Minato-san. I hadn't expected a competition here.   
Happy - Hearing that, my motivation is fully charged! ...As they say.   
   
Aigis   
It's difficult to explain, but I will do my best in everyday life, as well as in battle against the Shadows.   
All for one and one for all! Let's go team! ...As they say.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Aigis seems to have found a new   
purpose through tending the plants...   
   
Aigis   
Naturally, I will still continue to look after them at full throttle.   
Let's get started right away.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I tended the plants with Aigis...   
It looks like they're going to grow nicely...   
   
Aigis   
Once again, our mission has concluded without incident today. Let's head back now.   
   
Aigis   
It looks like they're growing quite nicely. I'm amazed at how robust they are.   
Happy - The ladybug has grown into a fine adult as well.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Does this mean our mission is complete? That's a job well done, Minato-san.

Happy - ...Oh, and we can't forget to thank the ladybug for contributing as well.   
   
Aigis   
That's true. We still need to watch out for birds and other animals.   
...But, maybe it will be okay to share a little with them, as well.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - ...That just shows that the ladybug has been hard at work, too.   
Happy - I'll go ahead and express our gratitude to it. Thank you, little ladybug.   
   
Aigis   
As I've tended these plants alongside you, I've realized something.   
   
Aigis   
I've made so many new discoveries beside these planters.   
Everyone is doing the best they can to make their way in the world.   
That goes for the plants, the pests, and the ladybug, too...   
And you as well, Minato-san.   
   
Aigis   
I may be a machine, but I also want to do the best I can.   
I'll give it my all to make my way in the world, just like everyone else.   
Do you think I'll be able to?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I won't let you beat me.   
Don't push yourself too hard.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - ...You're already working hard enough, Minato-san.   
Happy - But, hearing that from you is making me even more motivated.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - It's okay. I'm not going to act on my own anymore.   
Happy - I just want to do a little bit to protect everyone's futures.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Aigis seems to have found a new   
purpose through tending the plants...   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Of course, I don't plan on sacrificing my attention here either.   
Happy - Okay, it's time to get started!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I tended the plants with Aigis...   
It looks like they're going to grow nicely...   
   
Aigis   
Happy - I think we did another thorough job today. Shall we head back now?   
   
Aigis   
It appears they are growing well. Hip hip hooray, as they say.   
The ladybug has grown into a fine adult as well.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - I believe this is "mission complete." Well done, Minato-san.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's thanks to your help.   
It's too early to relax.   
We aren't growing bugs here...   
   
Aigis   
I tried to do everything in my power. I'm glad I was of service.   
The ladybug put in a lot of work as well. We thank you for your service!   
   
Aigis   
That's true. We must be prepared for surprise attacks.   
That reminds me, Junpei-san came here the other day trying to get some free samples, but I quickly gunned him down.   
If he comes back, rest assured, he will be shot on sight.   
   
Aigis   
But, it's thanks to the ladybug that the plants didn't suffer any significant damage.   
I will thank it for its service in your place, Minato-san!

That is my new goal from now on.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I won't let you beat me.   
I don't get it.   
   
Aigis   
I am impressed, Minato-san. I hadn't expected a competition here.   
Happy - Hearing that, my motivation is fully charged! ...As they say.   
   
Aigis   
It's difficult to explain, but I will do my best in everyday life, as well as in battle against the Shadows.   
All for one and one for all! Let's go team! ...As they say.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Aigis seems to have found a new   
purpose through tending the plants...   
   
Aigis   
Naturally, I will still continue to look after them at full throttle.   
Let's get started right away.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I tended the plants with Aigis...   
It looks like they're going to grow nicely...   
   
Aigis   
Once again, our mission has concluded without incident today. Let's head back now.   
   
Aigis   
It looks like they're growing very well. I'm amazed at how robust they are.   
Happy - The ladybug has grown into a fine adult as well.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Does this mean our mission is complete? That's a job well done, Minato-san.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's all thanks to your help.   
It's too early to relax.

Aigis   
How much longer until they can be harvested?   
   
Aigis   
Size doesn't matter, as long as they grow well.   
   
Aigis   
These bugs... I will target them with the repellant.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Thanks to the care we put in, it   
looks like this will be a big harvest...

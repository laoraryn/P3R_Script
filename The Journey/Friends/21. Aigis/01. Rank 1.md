Aigis
I find myself coming here a lot lately.
Sad - Before, I couldn't understand the benefits of coming to these "shrines."
But lately, that's changed...

Aigis
This is also where we met Koromaru-san last summer...
He waited here until we found him, even though he knew his master had died.

Aigis
I can understand why now.
Sad - What drives people isn't necessarily facts, but feelings...
Sad - He knew for a fact that his master had died, but his feelings of wanting to be with him made him stay.

Aigis
I feel the same.
I recognized the fact that I can't protect you, but I came back anyway.

Aigis
Subconsciously, I was acting based on my emotions, rather than logic.
I was so confused at the time that I didn't notice it, but it's true.

Aigis
Happy - The parameters governing my behavior seem to have been updated during my time with you, Minato-san.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can sense Aigis's faint affection...

Aigis
...Oh, I misspoke.
I mentioned "what drives people"...

Aigis
Happy - But of course, Koromaru-san and myself aren't "people."
Happy - Heheh, sorry...

Aigis
Sad - ......

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Aigis looks somewhat lonely.
We decided to go back to the dorm.

Happy - Yo, 'sup, Arisato?   
Check this out...   
Angry - The hot spring's over there, right? Now if you consider how the garden is fenced...   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Angry - Are you seriously trying to peep? You do know you can get arrested for that, right?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Angry - Of course not, I'm not stupid. But just imagine the steamy paradise beyond the garden fence!   
Angry - Close your eyes and focus... Then you'll see everything inside your mind!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Give it up, you idiot. No way you can see a damn thing like that.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Angry - Give up!? Never! Nothing is impossible!   
Angry - And you call yourself an athlete!? Where's your spirit!?   
Angry - You're the only one holding yourself back! You gotta push your limits to succeed!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Surprised - Wha...!?   
Happy - ...I never thought I'd see the day you'd teach me something about sportsmanship!   
Angry - You're right. I'm not gonna give up... I'll never give up!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Angry - Sooo... How's it going over there, Miyamoto?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - I can't see a thing, man. It's just pitch black. Wonder if it's all the steam...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Yo, what's up?   
Check this out...   
The hot spring's in there, right? So based on the hotel's layout...   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
This guy seriously thinks he can sneak a peek.   
Give it up, Kenji. What, do you think you're ten feet tall?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Give up!? Never! Nothing is impossible!   
What kinda athlete are you!?   
If you accept your limits, you'll never succeed!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Wha...!?   
...I never thought of it that way...!   
Alright. I won't give up...!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
...Although I guess our height is one of those limitations we can't overcome...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Oh, hey, Arisato. You already changed into your yukata? Damn, you're fast.   
Exasperated* - Dude, you won't believe what Miyamoto did today. Help me talk some sense into him.   
Angry - And do you always have to wear that stupid jersey?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - 'Course I do! This way, I'm ready to run wherever, whenever. Duh.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Angry - That's the problem! You literally just run off! You have no idea how exhausted I am because of you.   
Exasperated* - Do you know what this guy did? He went on a mad dash up the hill at Kiyomizu-dera...   
Exasperated* - The rest of our group had to chug along to try and keep up with him!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Look, man, if you see an incline, you gotta run uphill. That's what a real athlete does. Right, Arisato?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Whew, I worked up a sweat after that run. Guess I'll hit the baths.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - At this rate, I'm gonna run outta stamina before the trip's over...   
Angry - Dude, what about the girls in our group? You better apologize to them.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Exasperated* - ...It's already the last night of our trip.   
Exasperated* - All we ever did was visit the temples, but I think I'm gonna miss it here once we get home.   
Sad - There's just one thing I regret...   
Sad - Where is the girl of my dreams!? Aren't romantic encounters supposed to happen on school trips?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - That's all you ever talk about. Isn't it about time you grow up?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Wow, look at you all high and mighty. Even though you're the one sneaking glances at Takeba-san in her yukata.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Angry - Wha—!? I wasn't looking at her!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Haha, there's nothing to be embarrassed about. She's a real sight for sore eyes, after all.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Angry - Sh-Shut up! I said I wasn't looking at her!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
This is our last night... *sigh* All we did was visit shrines, but I'm kinda sad about going home.   
There's still one thing we've gotta do, though...   
Come on, Kaz! Right here, right now! This is our last chance!   
You crouch down, and I'll get on your back! That way, I can see!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
H-Hey... Why are you pulling me into this!?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Dude, we can take turns! Come on!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Well, duh! Obviously...   
No! I'm not listening to you!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Why not!? It's not dirty! What's your plan, just walk in there and stare? That's just as bad!   
*sigh* Man... You're so boring... Why did I have to be in your group...?

Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Hello, Arisato-kun. Are you on patrol as well?   
Happy - ...Just kidding. I plan on enjoying myself on this trip.   
I only hope there won't be any trouble while—   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Hey there, Odagiri-kun! Have you tried these complimentary snacks?   
They're sooo tasty!   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
No, I haven't had the chance—   
   
Sad - There's nothing left.   
Sad - Aren't those snacks supposed to be limited to one per person?   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - Oh, really? Oops... I ate them all. Sorry!   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
...I figured.   
I'll just pretend there weren't any in the first place.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sorry, Odagiri-kun. I'll check out the gift shop later to see if they'll have more snacks there.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Sad - N-No need. It's not like I wanted to try some or anything...   
   
OR    
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - Arisato-kun, you're here, too? Oh, right, you're a second-year, huh.   
By the way, have you tried these complimentary snacks?   
They're sooo tasty!

Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Oh, hey, Arisato-kun. I must say, the tour today wore me out.   
Sad - I was looking forward to going sightseeing around this historical city, but...   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - Yeah, it was one thing after another today.   
Some of the older ladies in our tour group passed out right in front of us.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
I'm glad you were there, Keisuke. Thanks to you, the situation wasn't nearly as bad as it could've been.   
Nevertheless, it was a shocking turn of events...   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Yeah... Even the tour guide passed out.   
Happy - The way you took charge and directed traffic was really impressive though, Odagiri-kun.   
Happy - Have you ever considered becoming a police officer in the future?   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Huh...? No, I hadn't given it any thought before.   
...Let's head to the hot springs. I'm covered in sweat after that whole ordeal.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Happy - You didn't have to get involved in that mess... But I suppose you'll never break your habit of meddling, Keisuke.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - Haha, the same goes to you. Pretty sure you were the first to leap into action.   
   
---   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - Hi, Arisato-kun. How was your tour today?   
Happy - We ran into some trouble on ours. I wanted to visit the temples, but...   
Some of the older ladies in our tour group passed out right in front of us.   
   
---   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Sad - Hey, Arisato-kun. Do you happen to see any tears in my pants at all?   
Sad - ...Maybe that was a bit much.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
The Kamogawa River has a nice ambience, huh?   
Happy - You see, Odagiri-kun was trying to skip rocks across its surface, but he lost his footing and—   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Sad - Can we please drop the topic?   
Angry - Besides, I'd say you're partially at fault for challenging me to hit the opposite bank, Keisuke.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - Aw... Don't you want to see if it's possible? The wind was blowing in the perfect direction and all.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
What's the point in doing that?   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Because... it'd make me happy?   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Angry - But I'm asking what good would come out of doing all that? It was still pointless.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - Don't you remember our elementary school days? We used to practice skipping rocks all the time.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Sad - ...Yes, but we're in high school now. You're a third-year, for crying out loud.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - ...Looked like you were going all out, though—to the point where you slipped and fell.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Angry - ...Again, can we please change the subject?   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - Oooh, you're sooo scary, Odagiri-kun.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Sad - To think, one of the last memories I make on this trip would make me feel so pathetic...   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
It's not a big deal. I guess that other bank was just a bit farther than we thought.

Stern-Looking Student   
Sad - You there. Do you happen to see any tears in my pants at all?   
Sad - ...Maybe that was a bit much.

Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Hey, are my pants dirty?   
A deer ate the treat I had in my pocket...   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
I didn't know there were deer in Kyoto. But you know, with the deer treat, Odagiri-kun was...   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Can we not talk about it?   
If you hadn't said you wanted to ride a deer...   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Didn't you want to ride it, too? It seems like its horns would make perfect handlebars...   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
And what would be the point of riding it?   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
I don't know... It'd be cool?   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
No, it wouldn't.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
But we did all sorts of things like that when we were in elementary school!   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Yes... And now we're in high school. You're a third-year.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
But... the deer treat...   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
...Can we please change the subject?   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
You're a scary guy, Odagiri-kun...

Yukari Takeba   
...Anyway, my friends and I are really into the dessert they serve at the café there.   
Happy - Oh! Do you wanna come with us after school sometime, Mitsuru-senpai?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Yes, of course.   
Happy - I'd like to try this "special strawberry parfait" you mentioned.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very happy* - Okay, cool! It's a date, then!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - If you have any other recommendations, I'd love to hear them, Yukari.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Oh, there's this new place one city over.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - If you have any other recommendations, I'd love to hear them, Yukari.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Hm... Oh, there's this new place one city over.

Akinari Kamiki   
Hurt - *gasp* *huff*   
Hurt - I got really into my reading last night... and never went to sleep...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Sad - I thought I'd be fine, since I've lost sleep from the pain and anxiety of my illness before, but...   
Sad - I suppose I'm not doing my health any favors like this...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You need to listen to your body.   
Maybe you should go rest?   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
...Thank you. Or rather, I suppose I should apologize.   
It's been so long since anyone told me off for anything...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Happy - Don't worry, I know my limits... and how to convince my body that it's still doing fine.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
I came out here because I was hoping to find you. I only have so much time left, you know...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
...Do you remember when I said I like reading heartwarming stories?   
There are as many stories as there are stars in the sky, but I don't think any of them are what I'm looking for.   
The problem is... none of those stories were written for people like me.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
I guess I'm just being selfish...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
...Just like I am with you, too.   
You're always coming to visit me, keeping me company and talking with me...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
How much of your valuable time have you spent with me?   
I don't deserve it. You're spoiling me...   
That's why I like you so much, though.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Kamiki smiled weakly at me...   
I feel like our relationship is stronger now...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Hurt - *huff* *huff*   
Happy - Sorry... I was in such a good mood that I overexerted myself.   
I'd like to see you again sometime...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I parted ways with Kamiki,   
then headed back to the dorm.

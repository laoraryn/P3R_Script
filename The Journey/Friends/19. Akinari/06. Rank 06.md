Akinari Kamiki   
Say, how do you feel about a pink alligator?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sounds fine to me.   
I dunno...   
Uh, what?   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Happy - I thought so too. I knew you'd understand.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
There are many times when people don't agree in life...   
...Though I suppose there are many things that could be disagreed upon.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Oh, sorry... I was just thinking about something.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
See, it's the main character of a story that I'm writing...   
He was born in a lush green forest, but he turned out to be pink.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
He stands out so much that he can't hunt for food easily, so he's always hungry.   
The other animals dislike him, and call him disgusting... almost like he's cursed.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
So, he was used to living alone... But one day, he made a friend.   
It was a little bird that had trouble flying...   
Every day, the bird would stand on the pink alligator's back and practice.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Happy - ...It's kind of embarrassing to tell you this.   
So, what do you think?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It sounds interesting.   
It needs work...   
I'd need to hear more.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Really?   
I've never written a story before, so I'm worried it's not going to be very good.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
But what matters is that I'm writing it for myself.   
Perhaps I can show you the entire novel someday...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
I see...   
...Well, this is my first time writing a story like this, so it's not going to be perfect.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
But, I'm writing it for myself, so that's what matters.   
Hopefully, you can learn something from the story once it's finished...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Well, it's still a work in progress...   
...I've never tried writing a story before, so maybe I'm not good at it.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
But, I'm writing it for myself, so that's what matters.   
I hope you can take something positive away from it, though...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
I actually came up with it the other day.   
I decided I wanted to write a heartwarming story just for myself.   
I'd like it to be a hopeful tale... about finding the meaning in one's life.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Happy - I think of you when I write... It's like I can hear you telling me not to die just yet.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Kamiki smiled weakly...   
I feel like our relationship is stronger now...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
...The wind is going to pick up soon. I can feel these kinds of things now.   
I hope I have enough time...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
We should leave. I'd like to see you again sometime.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I parted ways with Kamiki,   
then headed back to the dorm.

Akinari Kamiki
Hurt - *gasp* *gasp* *huff*
Hurt - ...Just give me a minute... so I can... calm down...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Take as long as you need.
You can do this.

Akinari Kamiki
Hurt - The pain comes and goes... But I'll be fine once it passes.
Happy - ...It's getting better. Thanks.

Akinari Kamiki
Happy - Right... Thank you, I'm... fine...
Happy - The pain comes and goes... But I'll be all right once it passes.

Akinari Kamiki
I... stopped taking my medicine.
Sad - It's not going to cure me anyway, right? It just eases my pain and suffering...

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's dangerous.
Why did you stop?

Akinari Kamiki
Sad - I know... It's only cutting down what time I have left...
Sad - But, my medicine makes me drowsy, and if my hands go numb and shake, then I can't write...
Sad - I have to finish my story...

Akinari Kamiki
Sad - My medicine makes me drowsy, and if my hands go numb, then I can't write...
Sad - I have to finish my story...

Akinari Kamiki
Sad - The reason I haven't finished my story... is because I haven't found the meaning of my life yet.
Sad - I'll get absorbed in my writing... erase it... and then lose sight of how to reach the end.

Akinari Kamiki
Sad - ...When I'm with you, I can almost see it... It's because you've been here for me.
Sad - It seems like you might have given me a reason to finish...

Akinari Kamiki
I'm probably writing this book to find my own meaning in life...
And, if I do find it... If I do finish the story...

Akinari Kamiki
Sad - ...I hope we have a little more time together, after that.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Kamiki smiled weakly...
I feel like our relationship is stronger now...

Akinari Kamiki
...The sun... is setting...

Akinari Kamiki
That's it for today, but I hope to see you again.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I parted ways with Kamiki,
then headed back to the dorm.

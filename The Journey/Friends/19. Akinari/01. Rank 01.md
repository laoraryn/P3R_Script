Akinari Kamiki   
...I remember you. You're the one who was playing with that elementary school girl.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
She was very...   
...Bright.   
Her face shone with the warm light of new life.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
...And then there's me, cooped up in the hospital, struggling to breathe.   
I'm just a faint glimmer compared to her dazzling light.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Sad - Misery is a harsh mistress.   
Sad - I feel as though I'm lying in an unyielding darkness.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
...Do you understand how I feel?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I think I might.   
No, I can't.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Angry - ...Liar. And if you're not lying, then you're just ignorant.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
I didn't think so...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
......   
Any day now, I'm going to die.   
I have an incurable hereditary disease.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Unless you're in my situation, you can't understand how I feel.   
Angry - ...But I prefer it that way. I wouldn't wish this on anyone.   
There are no platitudes to stave off death...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Sorry about that. I didn't mean to depress you or anything.   
It's been quite a while since I spoke to someone my own age.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Sad - ...It's only natural for those dwelling in the depths of darkness to yearn for the light.   
Happy - I'm glad we could meet, though. If there is a god, I'll be able to thank him soon enough.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I've become acquainted with Akinari Kamiki.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
However...   
Sad - I doubt we will ever meet again.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
This was just a chance encounter. Nothing more.   
...Goodbye.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I parted ways with Kamiki,   
then headed back to the dorm.

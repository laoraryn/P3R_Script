Happy - ...I've been waiting.
Happy - I finished my story and wanted to show it to you...

Akinari Kamiki
I was having a lot of trouble with the ending... but I finally figured it out.
After the alligator ate his friend, the bird, he cried and cried for a long time.
In fact, he was so sad... that he drowned in his own tears.

Akinari Kamiki
His tears became a sparkling lake, around which grew beautiful flowers, and a tree that bore delicious fruit.
The other animals in the forest came there often to relax...
But none of them knew the alligator had created it, or that he was gone.

Akinari Kamiki
...The end.

Akinari Kamiki
That's the ending I decided on.
Even though the alligator didn't find meaning in his life, the residents of the forest did.
...They just didn't realize it.

Akinari Kamiki
The meaning of my life isn't something I should spend my time on.
It's more about how I was able to affect others.

Akinari Kamiki
So... for me, or you, or anyone... just simply existing gives our lives meaning.
People can't survive without help from others... We all depend on one another.

Akinari Kamiki
I don't know how to explain it, but... does that make sense?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I think so.
I still don't get it.

Akinari Kamiki
Happy - I'm glad...

Akinari Kamiki
...That's what I've found to be the meaning of life.
Perhaps you and others have different concepts of what it is...
Happy - But, I hope someday you can understand.

Akinari Kamiki
This is the notebook I wrote my story in. I've poured my heart and soul into it.
I wanted to give you this... since you shared my final moments.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
DEV: Unused

Akinari Kamiki
Happy - Ah... My body feels lighter...
Happy - I'm so grateful to have met you...
Happy - It seems so insignificant, but maybe there was some meaning in it, for both of us...

Akinari Kamiki
Happy - Thank you... In the end... I'm glad that I was born...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can sense Kamiki's tender feelings...
I feel like our relationship is stronger now...

SYS_011_0_0
The Sun Social Link reached its maximum level! You can now fuse **Asura**, the grand being!

Akinari Kamiki
I have to go now...

Akinari Kamiki
Happy - Maybe, someday, Minato...
Happy - We'll meet again...
Happy - I'd like that...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
...With the notebook tightly in hand,
I decided to head back to the dorm.

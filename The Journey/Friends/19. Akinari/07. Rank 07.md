Akinari Kamiki
I've been writing more of my story. How much did I tell you about...?
Oh right... The pink alligator and the bird became friends, right?

Akinari Kamiki
This was the alligator's first friend, and he was very happy.
...They started going to the river every day, and the alligator would listen to the little bird sing.

Akinari Kamiki
But the pink alligator still had trouble hunting, because of his color.
He was so terribly easy to spot, and his prey always had plenty of time to escape.
Eventually, he became so hungry that he grew dizzy...

Akinari Kamiki
...And one afternoon, he accidentally ate the bird as it slept in his mouth.
Of course, he immediately realized what he'd done.
He drank swamp water to vomit his friend back up... but he was too late. The bird was already dead.

Akinari Kamiki
After that, he couldn't bring himself to eat anything.

Akinari Kamiki
...That's as far as I've written. I haven't decided on an ending yet.

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's a good story.
It sounds really depressing.
I've heard that one before.

Akinari Kamiki
You really think so? Then, maybe you'll enjoy the final product.
I always thought the only thing I could give other people was hopelessness, but maybe...

Akinari Kamiki
Oh, is it really that dark...? For me, it's hard to tell.
The words I use come from my own life. I don't really have a point of reference.
But I see. So, this is depressing for others.

Akinari Kamiki
I see... So, I guess my life isn't so unusual after all.
I thought nobody understood me, but you're saying this story of mine has been done before...
...Interesting.

Akinari Kamiki
You know, when I mentioned I was writing a diary...
That was a lie. I was writing my will.
I couldn't face reality... and I was essentially screaming curses into my notebook.

Akinari Kamiki
For now though, I'm writing my story in the same notebook.
It probably isn't very good, but it contains some things that I've learned during my short life...
When it's done, I'd like you to be the first to read it... Meeting you is why I started writing it, you know.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Kamiki is looking deep into my eyes...
I feel like our relationship is stronger now...

Akinari Kamiki
I've been trying to come up with a good ending, but I just can't decide...
Sad - And I'm running out of time...

Akinari Kamiki
Happy - ...I've got to go now, but I hope to see you again.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I parted ways with Kamiki,
then headed back to the dorm.

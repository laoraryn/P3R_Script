Thin Young Man   
You are...   
Hm... From my point of view, everyone else leads a fairy tale life.   
That would include you... Or would you say you are a victim of sorrow?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Huh?   
I'm normal.   
   
Thin Young Man   
...Never mind. Hope and hopelessness are two sides of the same coin, anyhow.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It's difficult to figure out   
what he's trying to say...   
If I want to talk with him, I'll need   
to improve my ...   
If I were at least , then I   
might be able to understand him...   
   
Thin Young Man   
...I see. Then it appears we have nothing more to discuss.   
   
Thin Young Man   
Huh... Your eyes are so clear...   
Your soul must be burning brightly.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It seems the young man has noticed me   
thanks to my impressive .   
This might be my chance to   
get to know him better...   
   
Thin Young Man   
The me that I see reflected in your eyes and the real me—if there is one... How far apart are they?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Almost zero.   
About arm's length.   
Three lightyears...?   
   
Thin Young Man   
Hmm... That works.   
   
Thin Young Man   
Happy - Oh, you mean literally? Haha, I guess you have a point.   
   
Thin Young Man   
Yes, that's about right... A long, lonely distance to travel.   
   
Thin Young Man   
Your words are very beautiful. If I had something to write with, I'd note them down.   
I have a fountain pen... It uses red ink—blood red.   
Sad - My pen is my supporter, my spokesman, and my friend. However, it seems to have disappeared.   
Sad - Without it, my screams are silenced...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The young man seems sad...   
Apparently, his fountain pen is missing.   
   
Thin Young Man   
I'm still looking for my fountain pen. Please let me know if you find it.   
Perhaps the creature with white fur and bright red eyes kidnapped it...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Apparently, his fountain pen is missing.   
   
Thin Young Man   
Oh... The pen in your possession... By any chance, is that my missing fountain pen?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I handed him the .   
   
Thin Young Man   
Happy - Ahh... Welcome home, dear friend... And thank you, for finding it.   
Happy - Now the mighty scream quietly bellowing within me has regained its voice... My "diary"...   
Happy - My name is Akinari Kamiki.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Happy - Have a seat, if you'd like. I'll write something for the two of us...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The young man seems to have   
taken an interest in me.   
Should I spend the day with him...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Spend time with him   
Not now   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Sad - That's unfortunate... Then farewell, my benefactor.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Oh, it's you.   
Why don't you have a seat? This bench is too big for me alone.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It seems Kamiki would enjoy my company.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Sad - Ah, you— *cough*   
Hurt - *cough* *wheeze* *wheeze*   
Hurt - *cough* *cough*   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Sad - Sorry... *pant* *pant*   
Hurt - If you... *pant* don't mind... *pant* please stay... until I've caught my breath...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Happy - Ah, hello there.   
Happy - It's good to see you. Please, have a seat, if you'd like.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend the day with Kamiki?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Spend time with him   
Check Social Link status   
Not now   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Happy - Then this bench shall be our meeting place.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Sad - Thank you...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Sad - I see... Then perhaps we can speak some other time.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
You...?   
Sad - ......   
...Oh, it's nothing.   
Why don't you have a seat? This bench is too big for me alone.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Then this bench shall be our meeting place.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Sad - I see. Well, it's probably better this way...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Ah, it's you.   
Sad - Would you like to talk with me again? But only if you're so inclined, of course...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Happy - Thanks. I suppose I had actually been waiting for you.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Sad - Ah, you— *cough*   
Hurt - *cough* *wheeze* *wheeze*   
Hurt - *cough* *cough*   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Hurt - Sorry... *wheeze* It's happening again... *pant* *pant*   
Sad - It'll pass soon... but would you mind... staying with me until then...?   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Thank you... You're very kind...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Ah, it's you.   
Sad - I'd like to speak with you again, should fate allow.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Happy - Ah, I'm glad to hear it.   
Happy - Through our conversations, this bench becomes the bridge that connects me to humanity.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Ah, it's you.   
I've been looking forward to the next time I could speak with you.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Happy - You'll stay? Thank you, truly...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Sad - Ah, you— *cough* *cough*   
Hurt - *wheeze* *wheeze*   
Hurt - *cough* *cough* *pant* *pant*   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Sad - I'm... *cough* all right...   
Hurt - Sorry... *cough* *cough* It'll pass... soon...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Sad - Thank y— *cough* I'm glad... you came...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Ah, it's you...   
Happy - Would you like to talk for a bit? You can sit here, as usual...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Happy - Thank you. Today is actually a special day...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Happy - Thank you...   
Happy - This bench really is our special little place.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Hurt - I see... *cough* *pant* *pant*   
Sad - Don't worry, I'm all right. I'm just... going to rest here for a bit...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Hurt - I see... *cough* *pant* *pant*   
Sad - ...I'm okay. I'm just... going to stay here a little longer.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Oh, I see. That's all right. Your time is your own.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
I see... Well, I look forward to when we meet again.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Hurt - I see... *cough* *pant* *pant*   
Sad - It's okay... I'm all right. It's... nice and warm here.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
I see... I hope I'll have a chance to see you again.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
I see.   
Happy - I'll see you later, then. I'm going to stay here for now.

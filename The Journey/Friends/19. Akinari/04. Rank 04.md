Akinari Kamiki
Happy - I'm doing better today.
Happy - I know it probably looked dire last time, right? Sorry if I scared you.

Akinari Kamiki
I'd been reading a book before we met that day.
I guess I got so absorbed in it that I didn't realize how cold the wind was.
...Do you enjoy reading books?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'd say so.
No, I don't.
It depends on the book.

Akinari Kamiki
I see... That's something we have in common, then.

Akinari Kamiki
I see... I suppose I didn't like them much either, back when I was healthier.

Akinari Kamiki
Happy - Heh... I'll admit I'm somewhat picky, myself.
A terrible book is a terrible waste of time. And there's no more grievous sin than that.

Akinari Kamiki
Nowadays, reading books is all I do.
I find that they give me a way to escape everything else.
I can just get lost in the book's private world...

Akinari Kamiki
...Do you read books all the way through?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Of course I do.
I stop if I get bored.

Akinari Kamiki
Oh, you do...? I don't like to see them end.

Akinari Kamiki
Oh, do you...? I don't usually reach the end either, although I think our reasoning differs.

Akinari Kamiki
The more engaging a story is, the more I want to get lost in it, but... I'm always afraid to finish it.
...Because once I finish the story, I'll have to come back to reality.

Akinari Kamiki
Sad - This inescapable body of mine...

Akinari Kamiki
Heartwarming stories, filled with hope...
Those are the kinds of books I like to read.
Happy - They give me a little solace, when I have to come back to the real world.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Kamiki smiled weakly...
I feel like our relationship is stronger now...

Akinari Kamiki
It looks like the sun is already setting... Time is so ruthless...
Happy - I hope we have another chance to talk.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I parted ways with Kamiki,
then headed back to the dorm.

Middle-Aged Lady - MSG_000_0_0
...Hello, there.
Oh... Excuse me...?
Are you... Arisato-kun?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yes.
...And you are?

Middle-Aged Lady - MSG_002_0_0
Ah, so it was you...
...Oh, excuse me. I'm... Ms. Kamiki.
Akinari's mother. My son talked about you a lot...

Middle-Aged Lady - MSG_003_0_0
...Oh, excuse me. I should have introduced myself first.
I'm... Ms. Kamiki.
Akinari's mother. My son talked about you a lot...

Kamiki's Mother - MSG_004_0_0
I was just thinking about him...
If you have time, would you like to stay and talk for a while?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure.
I'm a bit busy today...

Kamiki's Mother - MSG_006_0_0
That's wonderful. Please, sit down.
Today is... a special day.

Kamiki's Mother - MSG_007_0_0
Oh...
Oh, that's all right, don't worry about it. I know things can get busy when you're young.

Kamiki's Mother
What a coincidence, seeing you today.
It must be another one of God's whims...

Kamiki's Mother
Today is my son's... Akinari's birthday.
He'd be twenty if he was still alive.

Kamiki's Mother
Only nineteen years...
...It was too soon.
He was almost an adult, but he never made it...

Kamiki's Mother
Akinari had a genetic disease. I'm completely healthy, but him...
......

Kamiki's Mother
The doctors detected it when he was born... They knew he wouldn't live to see adulthood.
Every day, I worried whether he'd wake up the next morning... I blamed myself for what he inherited...

Kamiki's Mother
But...
He said something to me near the end.

Kamiki's Words
"I'm sorry to have brought so much pain into your life, Mother."
"I'm glad that I was born into this world."
"I'm glad to have been your son."
"Thank you for the life you've given me."

Kamiki's Mother
"I'm sorry to have brought so much pain into your life, Mother."
"I'm glad that I was born into this world."
"I'm glad to have been your son."
"Thank you for the life you've given me."

Kamiki's Mother
He...
He suffered so much, and yet he still said that to me...

Kamiki's Mother
But... Akinari brought me so much happiness too.
Feeling his warmth as I carried him in my arms after he was born... Those tiny hands... That first smile...
Hearing his breathing as he slept at night...

Kamiki's Mother
Every day, I was so grateful he was alive... Every day, I found new joy in him.
Now... I'm so alone, and there's nothing I can do...

Kamiki's Mother
But, my boy gave me so much...
I have to keep going, looking straight ahead... That's how I want to live.

Kamiki's Mother
I'll eat the finest foods, visit the most exotic places...
I'll do everything, absolutely EVERYTHING, that Akinari couldn't...

Kamiki's Mother
I'll have so many stories to tell him about the things I've done.
On that day... when we meet again, on the other side.
If I didn't have that to look forward to... I don't know how I could go on.

Kamiki's Mother
That reminds me... When my son's condition worsened, he started writing a children's story.
But when I was cleaning out his room, I never found his notebook...

Kamiki's Mother
He said he wanted you to be the first one to see it, when he was done.
Then he laughed and said I would be second...
I suppose... he wasn't able to finish the story...

Minato Arisato - Selection
He did finish it.
I have the notebook.

Kamiki's Mother
What...? So, did you get to read the story...?

Kamiki's Mother
What...? My son... He gave it to you?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I explained how I received the notebook from
Kamiki, and that I heard the entire story...

Kamiki's Mother
I... I see... So, you did...
I'm so glad... That was my only regret...
It was awful to think that he wasn't able to finish his project...

Kamiki's Mother
...Oh, you should hold onto his notebook. I'm sure that's what he would want, too.
I'll hear the story from him directly, when I see him on the other side...
...Now I have one more thing to look forward to.

Kamiki's Mother
I'm glad I could finally meet you. Thank you.
...Before I go, let this old woman give you one piece of advice...

Kamiki's Mother
Take good care of the ones you hold dear.
If you wait until their day comes... it's too late. Clinging to their cold bodies won't bring them back.

Kamiki's Mother
...Everyone who's born will die someday.
Not just Akinari, or me, or even you. It's all the same...

Kamiki's Mother
So before that happens...
It doesn't take a grand gesture. You don't have to make a big production of it, but...
If you love someone, let them know it.

Kamiki's Mother
We all go through life with the same struggles, the same heartbreak...
We should all lift each other up with the same love and kindness as well...

Kamiki's Mother
I'm sure you have something precious you can share with people, too...
Don't ever forget it...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Kamiki's mother left without looking back...

...Hm?   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Hey, eat up—you're slowing down! Is that all you've got?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's not over yet!   
You wanna see what I've got!?   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Oh, saving your strength for the last stretch, huh? Then let's do this!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Angry - Go, go, go, go!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Surprised - Th-That's the forbidden burning tongue technique! Then I'll do it, too!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Angry - Go, go, go, go— Ow! Hot, hot!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hayase and I finished   
eating at the same time.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Whew... Looks like it's a tie.   
Happy - Not many people can keep up with me. I'm impressed, Arisato!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I thought I could win.   
I expected to lose, actually.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - That so? Guess it was close then. Whew...   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Same here. I didn't think I'd win that one. Whew...   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
You had a lot of guts challenging me at takoyaki, though. I respect that.   
I knew you had potential when I met you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hayase has a fearless smile on his face.   
The star runner from another   
school has taken a shine to me.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
The way I see it, a tie's no better than a loss.   
I'll do like I promised and run a hundred laps around the city. You do whatever you think is best.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Heck of a fight today! See you around!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I decided to go back to the dorm.

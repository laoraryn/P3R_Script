Track Team Advisor - MSG_000_0_0
Oh, Arisato. I was just looking for you.
This came for you. It's from Hayase.
I bet his school is sorry he's gone. He was a heck of an athlete.
But it's good news for us. Now there's nothing standing between us and total victory!
Well, I'll see you around.

I received a letter from Hayase.
I better read it.

Letter from Hayase
"How's it going, Arisato? I don't know your address so I'm sending this to the school."

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Hayase's firm handwriting fills the page...
I can almost see Hayase's face.

Letter from Hayase
"I'm doing good. I'm starting to get used to the job, too."
"But the real reason I'm writing is because of track."
"Before, I'd pretty much given up hope of ever continuing."

Letter from Hayase
"Except there was a part of me that refused to let it go."
"I don't care what it sounds like—track and field was my whole life!"

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can tell Hayase was in a good
mood when he wrote that.

Letter from Hayase
"I guess the factory manager realized what's up, and he wants to help me out."
"We're gonna make a track team here!"

Letter from Hayase
"Well, I call it a team, but it's really just a few guys at the factory."
"We practice after work and sometimes on our days off."
"The other day, we did endurance swimming at Lake Biwa. We've even climbed Mt. Hiei."

Letter from Hayase
"We don't have fancy equipment like before, so we're not as efficient. But I'm still having a blast."
"Most of the guys are just in it for fun, so I don't really get to do any serious training."
"But I guess it'll even the playing field for them."

Letter from Hayase
"How about you? You're still at it, right?"
"I'm sure you're just gonna keep getting better and better."
"It's weird how badly I wanna see you improve."

Letter from Hayase
"Look, Arisato."
"One day... you and I are gonna go at it again."
"And if I'm gonna be a good rival, then I've got a lot of work to do."

Letter from Hayase
"It feels nice having a goal to work toward."
"Almost forgot what it was like..."

Letter from Hayase
"Oh yeah, and my mom's getting better! She's in a long-term care facility with lots of fresh air."
"My relatives and friends come by the house, so my siblings are in good hands, too."

Letter from Hayase
"Things have been pretty great these days."
"I feel like I can take care of the people who matter to me. It's really fulfilling."

Letter from Hayase
"And I get to feel that way because of you."
"So thank you."
"Can't wait to see you again, Arisato!"

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The letter ends there...

Happy - All right, I'm getting fancy today and adding an egg to my order!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Whew... That hit the spot.   
Happy - You get a lot of bang for your buck here. Man, I can't remember the last time I had such a fresh egg.   
Maybe I should get some for them, too...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
For your teammates?   
Who's "them"?   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
No, I meant my siblings. Four of them, actually. I look after them.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Oh, my siblings. I've got four younger ones.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Our apartment's pretty small, though, so we're packed like sardines.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sounds like fun.   
That sounds rough.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - There's never a dull moment!   
Happy - You wanna come over sometime? Might be fun, as long as the floor doesn't collapse!   
Sad - But y'know, back then it was a lot more—   
   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Haha, you could say that. You wouldn't believe how hot it gets in the summer.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - I never mentioned this, but my father died five years ago.   
Sad - We were told his car fell off a cliff.   
I'm not fishing for sympathy or anything, I... I just thought you should know.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hayase told me about his family situation.   
He's going through some tough times...   
I feel like we're getting closer...   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Whoa, it's already this late? The preschool's gonna be letting out soon.   
See ya, Arisato.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It's getting dark, so I should head home.

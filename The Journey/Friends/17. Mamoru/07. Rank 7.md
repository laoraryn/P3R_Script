Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - Thanks for coming all the way here for this.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What did you want?   
It's no problem at all.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - Sorry, I just wanted someplace quiet to talk.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Glad to hear that. I wanted someplace quiet to talk.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - I just came from the hospital.   
Sad - After this, I have to pick my sister up from preschool, go shopping, cook dinner, do laundry...   
Sad - There's still so much I have to do.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sounds pretty rough.   
Stop whining and do it!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
It sure is, but I can handle it.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Oh, don't worry, it's nothing I can't handle!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
My mom had to do all this every single day.   
Sad - ......   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - Remember how I told you I had a chance to win that scholarship?   
Sad - Turns out I can't practice anymore. I just don't have the time for it.   
Sad - Besides, even with the scholarship, we still can't afford college.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - I mean, we don't even have enough to survive.   
Sad - We already lost Dad, and now Mom can't work.   
Sad - It's up to me to earn a living...   
Sad - ......   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Angry - I have no choice but to give up track.   
Angry - Why'd you have to die, Dad!?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
This isn't your fault.   
Do something about it!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - I wish I could've taken you on one last time...   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - I just wanted to run one more time. One last run at some big event. Just... one more time.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Angry - Don't you think I want to!? There's nothing I CAN do!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - ......   
Sad - Is this... really how it ends for me?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You have to accept it.   
Don't give up yet.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - Yeah...   
Sad - ......   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Angry - No... I've come too far to give up now!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Angry - I'm gonna compete. Even if it's my last time, I want to win.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Angry - You're right... I've come too far to give up now!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Angry - I'm gonna compete! Even if it's my last time, I want to win!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
I've dedicated most of my life to track and field.   
It's time to put everything I've learned to the ultimate test!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - I'm glad we could talk. Everything feels a lot clearer now.   
Happy - Because of you, I have something to aim for.   
Happy - Thanks, man!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I helped Hayase figure himself out.   
I feel like we're getting closer...   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Crap, my sister's probably waiting for me... See ya!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I parted ways with Hayase   
and went back to the dorm.

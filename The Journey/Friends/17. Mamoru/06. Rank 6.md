......
I've been waiting for a while,
but Hayase still isn't here.
Let's see...

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'll look around for him.
I'll wait a bit longer.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
He's not in any of the nearby shops...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
......

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Hayase still isn't here...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Hmm...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Guess I'll kill some time.
Guess I'll keep waiting.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Hayase still isn't here...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
......

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Hayase still isn't here...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Well...

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'll wait just a bit longer.
I'm just gonna go home.

Mamoru Hayase
Phone Call - Hello, Arisato?
Phone Call - Sorry, but I don't think I can make it today.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Well, what happened?
Don't worry, it's okay.

Mamoru Hayase
Phone Call - I'm really sorry...

Mamoru Hayase
Phone Call - I just feel bad since I'm the one who wanted to hang out...

Mamoru Hayase
Phone Call - But actually... my mom fainted.
Phone Call - I'm at the hospital right now.

Mamoru Hayase
Phone Call - They said it's exhaustion... since she works from morning till night.
Phone Call - Dammit! It's all my fault!

Mamoru Hayase
Phone Call - And my mom—she's trying to leave! She says we can't afford the medical bills.
Phone Call - Goddammit! Why can't I do anything!?
Phone Call - I'm useless! I'm just another one of her problems.
Phone Call - ......

Mamoru Hayase
Phone Call - ...I'm sorry about all that. I... I don't wanna be a problem for you, too.
Phone Call - But I'm glad you were the one to hear me out.
Phone Call - Talking about this kinda helped.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Hayase is going through some awful times.
He opened up to me about it,
and I feel like we're closer now.

Mamoru Hayase
Phone Call - I gotta get back to her room, so let's talk later, okay?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's getting late, so I'll go back to the dorm.

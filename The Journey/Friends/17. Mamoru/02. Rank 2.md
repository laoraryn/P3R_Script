Mamoru Hayase
Man, this is good! If I had the money, I'd get some for Mom.

Mamoru Hayase
Oh yeah, I forgot to mention. I get to eat here for free.
Not just here, but every restaurant in the strip mall. They're all supporting me.
I'm the only one who can eat as much as I want, wherever I want.

Mamoru Hayase
Sad - But I feel kinda bad, like I'm taking advantage of their kindness, so sometimes I pay the bill anyway.
Someday, I'll pay them back for everything.

Mamoru Hayase
Sad - But for now, I gotta take whatever I can get.
That's why I have to make it big—it's for everyone who's been helping me.

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'm kinda jealous.
Sounds like a lot of pressure.

Mamoru Hayase
Happy - Haha, yeah, I guess. Gotta count my blessings.
That's exactly why I need to work harder.

Mamoru Hayase
Sad - Well, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't.
But a little pressure can be a great motivator.
All that matters is how you deal with it.

Mamoru Hayase
By the way, who would you say is your biggest rival?

Minato Arisato - Selection
You.
Myself.

Mamoru Hayase
Happy - You're pretty good, but you're lightyears away from my level, pal.

Mamoru Hayase
Happy - ...True.
You can be your own worst enemy, but at the same time your greatest ally... You do get it.

Mamoru Hayase
Sad - ......

Mamoru Hayase
There isn't really anyone left who I wanna compete with.
The other guys on my team can't even keep up with me.
I guess what I'm looking for is a real challenge.

Mamoru Hayase
Hey, you should think about taking track more seriously. Then we can really push each other!
Might even reach new limits together...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Hayase sees some potential in me.
I feel like we're getting closer...

Mamoru Hayase
We'll catch each other between training sessions. Later!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I parted ways with Hayase
and went back to the dorm.

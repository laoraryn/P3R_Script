Shuji Ikutsuki
How the Shadows entered this world is still a mystery.
I used to be a researcher for Kirijo Electronics...
That is the primary reason why I'm the chairman of the board at your school.
And that is also what makes this dormitory such a convenient location to conduct SEES activities.
Oh, you should also know that I can't summon a Persona.
Happy - However, in order to perform my research, I arduously trained to enter the Dark Hour.
Happy - So if you need any help, please don't hesitate to ask. Not that there's much I can do there, ahahaha...

Shuji Ikutsuki
You did very well for your first night in Tartarus.
So, what'd you think of it?

Minato Arisato - Selection
It was exhausting.
It was eerie.
It was a piece of cake.

Shuji Ikutsuki
I understand. It's difficult to avoid the fatigue one experiences during the Dark Hour.
Having to fight Shadows while you explore only makes it even more exhausting.
But with enough time, I have no doubt you will be able to adapt to its rigors.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Yes, I agree.
That tends to be a natural first impression when entering such a mysterious tower.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Surprised - Why, that's absolutely remarkable! Would you like to apply to become the next chairman?

Shuji Ikutsuki
At any rate, we're going to need your help in order to investigate that tower.
I'll be counting on you.

Shuji Ikutsuki
How are your explorations of Tartarus proceeding?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Really good.
Not too hot...

Shuji Ikutsuki
Excellent. Then, continue the good work.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Well, don't trouble yourself over it. Just aim to continuously hone your skills.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Oh, make sure you keep a steady pace and don't push yourself too hard. Take your time and proceed with caution.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Do you have any idea what a chairman does?
I'm so busy, I don't have much time for my research.
That's why I'm going to dedicate this entire weekend to analyzing data.
From morning till night, I'll be toiling away like a robot... "Rust" in peace! Hahaha!

Shuji Ikutsuki
What a difficult mission! I can't believe what happened to you all.
Luckily, no one was hurt.
Happy - By the way, it would seem last night's incident with the monorail has been publicized.
Happy - A "brake failure," they're calling it. Quite a serious malfunction, wouldn't you say? Ahaha...

Shuji Ikutsuki
Oh, that's right. Midterms begin tomorrow.
Ah, those were the days, back when I used to pull all-nighter cram sessions.
After all, you've gotta study night-to-five! Get it? Haha...ha...

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Well, I sure am glad that you agreed to take over caring for the plants.
Happy - To be honest, just climbing the stairs up to the rooftop is rough for an old man like me...

Shuji Ikutsuki
I'm a little disappointed about Yamagishi-kun as well.
It's quite difficult to find someone who has the potential.
Wouldn't you feel more confident in your abilities with more team members?

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's true.
We'll be fine on our own.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Thankfully, Sanada-kun has rejoined the team.

Shuji Ikutsuki
But, if any of you fall ill, the team's strength will be sorely impacted.
Depending on so few members puts us in a very precarious position.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Hmmm... It seems Takeba-kun has a sixth sense when it comes to Shadows.
Actually, that's quite common.
Dealing with Shadows has a tendency to enhance other... senses.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Hmm... This isn't good.
We're getting a lot of inquiries from parents and reporters alike...

Shuji Ikutsuki
Kirijo-kun and Sanada-kun left to walk Yamagishi-kun home. It's late, after all.
Still, today was a great day for us all.
We've gained new power and learned more about Shadows... We're entering the next phase of our battle.
We can't just sit on our hands, either. I'd say we could use a new trick up our sleeves...

Shuji Ikutsuki
Yamagishi-kun is surprisingly skilled with technology. And she's very kind, always considering others' feelings.
Her name suits her perfectly. "Fuu" means wind, and "ka" means flower.
Like a flower, gently blowing in the—

Ahem, getting off track there.

Shuji Ikutsuki
The real question is: do Shadows act independently? Or, are they working together towards some goal?
In essence, does a group of Shadows target a single human and ravage his mind with purpose...
Or is each individual Shadow simply devouring human minds for their own survival?
This is what we must discern.

Shuji Ikutsuki
The mood around here has been so serious lately, I thought I would lighten things up.
So, today I will be performing my top twenty puns for everyone!

Shuji Ikutsuki
If I'm not mistaken, the next Shadow will reveal itself soon...
We have a full moon coming up on the 7th. I expect the Dark Hour that night to be eventful.
This next operation will be crucial to my research.
Make sure you're prepared for the next full moon.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Tomorrow, my hypothesis will be put to the test...
A Shadow will appear during the full moon...
This is all quite exciting for a researcher such as myself.

Shuji Ikutsuki
I'm so sorry about everything. Let me know if there's anything I can say to be of help.

Shuji Ikutsuki
If there's anything you want to know more about, don't hesitate to ask.

Minato Arisato - Selection
What are the twelve Shadows?
How'd the public take it?
What happened with Mitsuru?
Tell me about Sanada.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Special Shadows that appear on full moons. They are the product of a research accident ten years ago.
In the incident, an experimental entity comprised of numerous Shadows was split once more into twelve large pieces.
As such, their power far exceeds those found in Tartarus. Tread with appropriate caution.

Shuji Ikutsuki
In the end, over fifty people were injured in that accident...
The media placed full blame on the Kirijo Group for the tragedy.
They singled out one researcher in particular, declaring him the main culprit behind it all.
Whether it was actually all his fault or not was not the issue...
The public was looking for someone to vent their pain and anger on.
So they chose him, even though he was a victim himself.
Their wrath was unparalleled. It was almost more frightening than seeing a horde of Shadows...

Shuji Ikutsuki
Under the pretense of assisting for the benefit of the Group, she was subjected to experiments on her Persona for many years.
Solving the mystery behind the unknown ability of Personas, the development of various equipment beginning with the Evoker...
None of this would've been possible without her cooperation.
There must've been some dangerous experiments at times, too... And yet she kept agreeing to it all, I'm told.

Shuji Ikutsuki
He and Kirijo-kun have known each other for a very long time.
Sanada-kun joined us when he was only in middle school.
Happy - At the time, we had a third member as well.
Happy - ...But, I digress.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Well, that is all regarding Yakushima.
Happy - Now, you will all need to concentrate on your final exams...

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Maybe I'll visit Mayoido myself when I have a bit of spare time.
Happy - There's a thing or two I'd like to ask...
Happy - But above all, I'd love to take the time to browse the antiques and learn the grand history behind each piece...

Shuji Ikutsuki
Hm? Is there something you'd like to know about Aigis?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Where are the others?
Why is she so... human?
How come she knows me?
No, not really...

Shuji Ikutsuki
I assume you are referring to the other anti-Shadow weapons...
Well, there were quite a few created. You could say they were Aigis's siblings.
However, they were all destroyed ten years ago, in the incident.
Aigis has been quite lonely since then.

Shuji Ikutsuki
A Persona is a product of the human psyche.
So, the plan had been to place a human mind inside an anti-Shadow weapon...
The only real issue was the form that weapon would take.
If we had used a tank, for instance, the weapon's mind would recognize itself as such...
And a contradiction would arise, as we all know a tank is not a living entity.
A human mind trying to reconcile its existence in this way would break down before you could blink.
Happy - So, how do we prevent that contradiction? You see where I'm going with this, don't you?
Happy - When given a body that more closely resembles the expectation of the mind, the spirit stabilizes.
Happy - That is why Aigis and her siblings were built in the form of human beings.

Shuji Ikutsuki
I couldn't say.
Perhaps it's a bug in her facial recognition programming...
Happy - I'm sure it's nothing to concern yourself with. You're not worrying overmuch, are you?

Shuji Ikutsuki
Surprised - I've heard there's a dog that can use a Persona.
Surprised - I'd been researching the possibility for quite some time, but it's hard to believe it could really be true.
Surprised - I mean, can you imagine? A dog using a Persona? A dog! I'm...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Pet-rified.
But, how can a dog...?

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Oh! You read my mind!
Happy - Hmm, you could be a formidable op-pun-ent...

Shuji Ikutsuki
Well, I'm sure it's nothing to be concerned about. This could even prove beneficial.
If you worry too much while you're young, your hair will fall out sooner.

Shuji Ikutsuki
That reminds me, I heard that dog used to live with the priest at Naganaki Shrine.
Exasperated* - So he stood his ground to protect the place important to him... Mm, that's a tearjerker...

Shuji Ikutsuki
Do you need sum-mer-time to get used to the operations?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'm good, thanks.
Enough already.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Good luck on the next one as well. I'll be rooting for you from the shadows, ahaha.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Hahaha, did I bomb that one?
Happy - Good luck on the next one as well. I'll be rooting for you from the shadows, ahaha.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Dogs can be very reliable, you know.
Why, there are rescue dogs, seeing eye dogs, narcotic detection dogs...
Let's put our trust in Koromaru.

Shuji Ikutsuki
I don't want to hear that your grades are slipping because you're spending too much time in Tartarus...
There's nothing I can do to help with that.
So, study hard and do your best in summer school.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Koromaru isn't just any old dog. He's a key member of SEES.
Please be mindful of what you're feeding him.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Surprised - Yes? What's the matter?
Surprised - Oh, you think that I don't know anything about fashion because I'm a researcher, right?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I do.
Not at all.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Well, I'll have you know that I am as fashionable as anyone.
However, my profession keeps me cooped up all the time, so I don't have many opportunities to dress up.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Good. You know that it's not prudent to judge a person based on preconceptions.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - I have my own style too, you know. For example, I'll coordinate which shirt I'm wearing with the color of my jacket...
Happy - You have to fashion-nate people, after all! You know, like fascinate, but with, erm... No...?

Shuji Ikutsuki
I'm very impressed with Amada-kun.
He is quite brave for his age.
Happy - I used to be a real scaredy cat when I was in elementary school.
Happy - I'd run crying if a bee even came near me.

Shuji Ikutsuki
I'm confident in tomorrow's operation...
Happy - What, with Aragaki-kun rejoining us...
Happy - I have no doubt it'll be an easy victory.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, but remember, overconfidence can only lead to defeat.
While it's true that Aragaki's quite powerful, he hasn't fought in quite a while.
Let's all concentrate on the task at hand. We must execute this flawlessly to win.

Shuji Ikutsuki
*sigh* Must you always be such a killjoy?

Shuji Ikutsuki
I wasn't too surprised to learn that she's Strega's support member.
Capturing her will provide us with quite an advantage...
We're growing ever closer to completing our mission.

Shuji Ikutsuki
We've defeated nine Shadows...
That means only three remain.
Happy - That's fantastic!
Happy - We're so close to the end. Keep up the good work.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Are you feeling any better, Arisato-kun?
I was going to inquire earlier, but I thought you might be "sick" of everyone asking if you're sick...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Just a little.
No, not really...

Shuji Ikutsuki
Well, that's understandable. Everyone gets worried when you're not feeling well.
Happy - I bet you were also thinking, "I didn't 'achoo-se' to catch a cold!" Get it? No...?

Shuji Ikutsuki
There's no need to be modest. I mean, it's hard to enjoy anything at all when you're not feeling well.
Happy - I bet you were also thinking, "I didn't 'achoo-se' to catch a cold!" Get it? No...?

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - I'm very confident about our next operation...
Happy - I have no doubt we'll be victorious.

Shuji Ikutsuki
I believe Kirijo-kun told you all about the tragedy that befell Amada-kun's family...
It happened after defeating the irregular Shadow, after the dawn of the Dark Hour.
Amada-kun probably didn't have any idea what was happening at the time.
Amada-kun and Aragaki-kun... I knew what was going on between them...
But I never expected it to turn into such a horrible tragedy...
We shall pray for Aragaki-kun's happiness in the next world.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Considering what you've all been through...
Happy - You did an excellent job on your exams.
Happy - You should all go out and enjoy the weekend.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Well, your exams are over now, so we should focus on the task at hand.
Only one Shadow remains. This will be the final battle.
The fate of this town rests in your hands.
Happy - I believe in you. Good luck.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - The team's morale seems to be high.
Happy - Yes, yes, that's very good. I will be looking forward to celebrating our victory.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Well, what would everyone like for their last meal?
Happy - Why don't I order a delivery of buffalo WINgs? Or some "victory-yaki"?
*sigh* I'm being ignored...
Well, I guess they're too focused to enjoy my jokes...

===============================================================================================

Shuji Ikutsuki
Surprised - Hmmm? Need something to wipe off your glasses?
Surprised - Well, yes, I do have something, but... you don't wear glasses.
Oh, I see!
It's clearly for a friend! Get it? Heh heh...
Happy - Hang on, let me grab you one.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Surprised - Hmmm? Need something to wipe off your glasses?
Surprised - I do have something, of course, but... you don't wear glasses.
Well, if you're looking for a wipe for eyeglasses, I have a spare.
Hang on.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Here. It looks dingy, but it works very well, in fact.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Oh, and here's a little something extra.

Shuji Ikutsuki
It's the secret item I was thinking of using at the farewell party for the third-years...
But it'd suit a cool kid like you better than an old-timer like me.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Now, I mustache you a question... How do you achieve a stylish look?
Happy - Why, don't you see? You have to have an eye for glasses!

Shuji Ikutsuki
It's the secret item I was thinking of surprising Aragaki-kun with the next time I saw him.
Surely, this would get that stoic face of his to break into laughter! Or, well, that was the plan...
Why don't you take it? I'd be happy if you could put it to good use.

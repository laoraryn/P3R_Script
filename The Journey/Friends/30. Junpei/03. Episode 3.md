Junpei Iori
Sad - Hm? Oh, it's you...
Hey, you see that message I sent you about grabbing a bite?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I spend some time with Junpei?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Spend time with Junpei
Not now

Junpei Iori
Happy - Nice! Wanna get something at the strip mall? Well, let's get to Port Island Station first...

Junpei Iori
Sad - Oh, okay... See ya.

-----

Junpei Iori
......

Junpei Iori
Heeey, mind if I pop in there real quick?

Flower Shop Lady
Welcome! What kind of flowers are you looking for today?

Junpei Iori
Oh, um, they're for a girl who's in the hospital right now.

Flower Shop Lady
Get-well flowers, are they? In that case, how about these ones here?

Junpei Iori
Ah, let's see...

Junpei Iori
Alright, one of those.

Flower Shop Lady
White flowers? Are you sure about that?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Huh? What, is that bad? She likes the color white, so I figured...

Flower Shop Lady
I'm sure it will be fine as long as you have a reason! Okay, let me wrap it up for you!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Uh, on second thought, I think I'll pass!
Surprised - S-Sorry for the trouble!

Junpei Iori
Sad - Well, sorry for the pointless detour.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Something wrong?
Not gonna buy anything?
Are you broke?

Junpei Iori
Sad - It's just... Look, I don't really get it myself.

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - I just don't really know if they're okay to buy...

Junpei Iori
Huh? Well yeah, I ain't exactly rollin' in dough, but I can still afford it, y'know?
Exasperated* - Besides, it's what comes after that's the problem.

Junpei Iori
Hey, wanna go sit somewhere for a bit? I don't feel like standin' around and talkin'.

Junpei Iori
Sad - So, the girl I'm visiting... I think I made her upset.
Exasperated* - I wanna tell her I'm sorry, but I don't even know what I did wrong.
Exasperated* - She told me not to come around anymore. So what am I supposed to do?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Go see her anyway.
Give it some time.
There's nothing you can do.

Junpei Iori
That's what you'd do if you were in my shoes?
Well, yeah. I'm sure you would be able to pull it off that way, but...

Junpei Iori
Time, huh... Makes more sense than goin' to see her without a plan.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Right? It's like there's no right answer.

Junpei Iori
Sad - It feels like I'm trapped in some kinda loop, y'know?
Sad - No matter how motivated I get, it's gettin' me nowhere. Been that way since I played baseball.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Those hero moments where if I could just hit the ball... Man, I'd get so amped.
Exasperated* - 'Cept I never once got to be the hero.
Sad - Whenever it was clutch time, I always struck out. And I guess nothin's different now.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Things can still change.
You're great the way you are.
You never learn.

Junpei Iori
Happy - ...Thanks.

Junpei Iori
Still, I just...
Happy - Eh, never mind. Thanks, man.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Damn, way to kick a man when he's down.
Happy - Buuut you're not wrong. I'm pretty hopeless, haha.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Whew, feels like I got a huge weight off my shoulders.
Didn't think the day would come when I'd be talking to you about my problems, Minato.
But I guess it's not really a secret that I got problems, huh. And besides...
I kinda hate to admit it, but the answer you give is probably the right one.

Junpei Iori
Angry - Ah, crap, I'm losin' my edge! I need somethin' to get back in the groove.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Let's get katsudon at Wakatsu to wake us up! Wait, do they even have katsudon there?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Junpei didn't buy the white
flowers he picked out.
I wonder if he's going to
skip visiting the hospital...

Junpei Iori
Hey! You zonin' out over there?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Junpei and I stopped by
Wakatsu on our way home.
I feel like my  have
improved after eating a healthy meal...

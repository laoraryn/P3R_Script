Junpei Iori   
Hey, there you are. Heading back now?   
Let's hit the arcade! I texted you about that, right?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Junpei has invited me to join him.   
This might be a good opportunity   
to get to know him better.   
Should I spend some time with Junpei?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Spend time with Junpei   
Not now   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Sweet! Let's go!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, you got plans already? Alright, maybe another time.   
   
-----   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - I was wondering, y'think we could pick up some new moves from these fighting games?   
Happy - Can you imagine if we had, like, a super badass special attack?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I like that idea.   
I don't know about that.   
We have to take this seriously.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Dude, right!?   
   
Junpei Iori   
What're you sayin'? Who doesn't dream about bein' a badass?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Badass moves are more important than you think, y'know. 'Specially if you're tryin' to impress other kids.   
   
Junpei Iori   
And besides, our power's gotta come from the heart, right?   
That's why I think comics and games'll give us a little inspiration.   
Happy - Seein' those heroes in action pumps me up and helps me picture my fights better, know what I mean?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Ahhh but hey, maybe someday someone'll make a game about our adventure!   
Happy - I mean, we have gone around saving people, like at the monorail.   
Happy - We kicked ass on that one, didn't we?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
We sure did.   
It was no big deal.   
You acted like a weirdo.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Makin' a comeback after hangin' on by a thread... It was like a freakin' movie, huh?   
Though I'd say you really stole most of the show.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, actin' all cool again, huh?   
Maybe I'll be the cool one next time...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Really? I was?   
Ah, well, the past is the past.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Ah, I admit, I wasn't on my game before...   
But next time, I'm totally gonna knock it outta the park!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I expect nothing less.   
You'll never outshine me.   
Who cares?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Whoa-ho, look who's talkin' like a leader!   
Happy - Heh, I'm stealin' the spotlight next time!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well someone's pumped!   
Happy - But you better watch out—I'm stealing the spotlight next time!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Wha— "Who cares"!?   
Oh, I'm gonna make you eat those words! Just you wait!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Y'know, I really do wanna do my best.   
   
Junpei Iori   
These powers, our mission...   
I got a lotta good things goin' for me. I've been really waitin' for somethin' like this.   
I feel like my life's finally starting to go somewhere.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - And I don't plan on lettin' you get the best of me just yet, ya hear?   
Happy - If you go screwin' around, I might just have to take over as leader!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Hehe...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Well, let's quit yappin' and play some games!   
Happy - Our next enemy can wait. You and me are throwin' down for the whole enchilada!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Bring it on!   
I won't lose to you!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oh yeah!? It's your funeral, buddy!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Yeah, take that! Die die die die die!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I left after an intense game with Junpei.

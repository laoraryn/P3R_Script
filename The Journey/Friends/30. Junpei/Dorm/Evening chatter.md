Junpei Iori
Dude, Kirijo-senpai's speech this morning was crazy.
I heard she won the election by a landslide.
Considering her background, I dunno why other people even bothered running.
Happy - Let's be real. We're all just a bunch of average joes compared to her, man.

Junpei Iori
Okay, weird question, but do you think it's really possible to kick ass in Tartarus and in school?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Piece of cake.
Doubt it.
Can you?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Well, aren't you confident. Why don'tcha put your money where your mouth is?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Well, at least we agree on one thing.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Me!?
Happy - I think you know the answer to that.

Junpei Iori
Are you the forgetful type?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Totally.
Not really.

Junpei Iori
Then better remember to stock up.
Especially from Officer Kurosawa... I heard from Sanada-san that you can't buy anything from him at night.
If you wanna go on a school day, then go right after classes are over.

Junpei Iori
Guess I won't have to nag you, then.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Goodbye, Golden Week... Hello, school...
Bummer, huh?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Not really.
Totally.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Dude, does anything faze you? You been livin' la vida loca or somethin'?

Junpei Iori
Man... How many days are left until summer vacation?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Dude, I was wondering what was up with the class, but then it hit me—exams are in a week.
That's why everyone's been so quiet.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Shit, I just had a dream about the monorail...
Sad - My exams were posted over all the windows!
Sad - My grades were all like 30 or 40%... Actually, that's pretty accurate.
Sad - Man, I can't escape exams even in my dreams.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Whew, how does it feel to be free!?
Happy - This is the best part about exams! Who cares about the marks they give you?
But, man... I bet I'll get depressed once I see my scores.

Junpei Iori
So, this whole time, there was a Persona-user in the class next door, huh?
Dude, we've been missing out...
Sad - What if she's cute!?

Junpei Iori
Happy - I pity the foo' who don't know when to quit!
Happy - Mr. J says to throw in the towel, boy!

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah.
Knock it off, idiot.
......

Junpei Iori
Real talk though? I'm a little worried 'bout how more and more people are becoming victims.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Don't call me an idiot, y-you... idiot!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Dude, the hell? You just gonna ignore me like that? Not cool, bro.

Junpei Iori
Well, I guess we should do some digging.
I wonder what people will say... It's a ghost story, after all.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Duuude, Yuka-tan is taking this way too seriously.
Sad - Why did I open my big mouth?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Dude, I can't tell you... It's a surprise.
Happy - Just wait until tonight!

Junpei Iori
Ekoda was Fuuka's homeroom teacher, right?
Surprised - I saw him just now, and, man, he looked like his world was gonna end.
Surprised - Is this what Kirijo-senpai meant!? She did tell him, "This won't be the last you'll hear of this."

Junpei Iori
Happy - Are you psyched now that Fuuka joined the team?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Definitely.
Not really.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Yeah, man, I'm totally stoked!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Dude, why you gotta be a total buzzkill?
Happy - You're gonna have a tough life ahead of you if you keep this up.

Junpei Iori
Fuuka seems to be doin' alright.
I was worried some people might give her a hard time since she was out for a while.
Happy - I wouldn't let them get away with that, man.

Junpei Iori
Eight left, huh? Well, you can count on me, dude!
Happy - I'll defeat every one of 'em and save the city!

Junpei Iori
I just saw Sanada-san... He had a weird look on his face...
Sad - Maybe his training isn't going so well? Psh... Yeah, right.

Junpei Iori
One week until the next full moon...
When I was little, I used to count the days before important events.
Did you do that, too?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah.
Not at all.

Junpei Iori
Happy - So, are you ready for this big event? It's not the same as when we were kids!

Junpei Iori
Man, you must've been one cool kid. Come on, let's blow off some steam.

Junpei Iori
There's a rumor sayin' there have been more Apathy Syndrome cases lately.
What a pain in the ass.

Junpei Iori
Don't you get kinda anxious before a full moon? I can't stop thinking about it...
At least that makes class go by a lot faster.

Junpei Iori
Angry - Huh? Whaddaya want?
Angry - Don't bug me if it's not important. I'm heading home now.

Junpei Iori
Aw, man... How am I supposed to study for exams at a time like this?
Sad - This sucks... There's no way I can get a good score.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Starting next week, it's summer vacation! Yakushima, here we come!
Sad - Too bad our exam scores are gonna be posted before that...
Man, why can't they wait until after we've enjoyed our freedom?

Junpei Iori
Sad - Dude, is it really okay for a robot to be here? Don't get me wrong, class'll be more interesting...
Sad - But what are we gonna do if someone finds out?
Sad - Man, I don't know about this...

Junpei Iori
Were you listening when she was talkin' about the culture festival?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, I was.
Nope.

Junpei Iori
Dude, a café is soooo lame. Why don't we do something fun?
Happy - Like a heavy metal café!

Junpei Iori
We're running a café. A CAFÉ, for heaven's sake!
It's so typical. Why don't we do something fun?
Happy - Like a heavy metal café!

Junpei Iori
Yeah? What's up?
I'd totally rush straight to the hospital right now.
But what if I mess up big time and get banned from seeing Chidori? I wouldn't be able to take that, man.
Hurt - Dammit...

Junpei Iori
Sad - I wonder what Chidori's doing right now...
Sad - I wish I could see her more often...

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Hey, the festival is this week, isn't it?
Man, I've been so busy thinkin' about Chidori that I completely forgot.
Well, screw that. I've got enough on my plate, so I'm gonna slack off.

Junpei Iori
Hey, I heard the archery team will be running a maid café at the festival.
I wonder if Yuka-tan will be in costume, too... Y'know, since she'll be a waitress and all.
Hm... I can't really see her in a maid dress though.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Hey, how ya feelin'? I hope your cold hasn't come back.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, I'm fine.
Not great...

Junpei Iori
Happy - That's more like it. You can't be sick 'cause we'll have a hard time without you.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Still!? Come on, man, take better care of yourself.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Dude, I can't concentrate! All I can think about is Chidori!
Oh, well... It's not like I pay attention all that much to begin with.

Junpei Iori
Man, I'm getting nervous about our next mission again...
That's why I keep falling asleep in class.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Man, I don't wanna go back to the dorm today...
Sad - Feels so heavy there now...

Junpei Iori
No one's talking about Aragaki-san anymore, now that we have exams.
I guess people just worry about their own problems, huh?
It's kinda sad, don't ya think?

Junpei Iori
Hey, I just heard that Moriyama's transferring.
You know, the girl who's friends with Fuuka?
Sad - They haven't been friends for very long though... Kinda sucks.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Did Yuka-tan just come out of the student council room?
I wonder why she was in there...
Seems like she's having a bad day.

Junpei Iori
Just standing here, we seem like regular students, huh...
No one would ever guess we fight Shadows...

Junpei Iori
Look around us, man. We're surrounded by ordinary students.
We could be just like them next month, huh...

Junpei Iori
Tomorrow's the day...
I couldn't concentrate in class at all today...
What about you?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, same here.
I'm not worried.

Junpei Iori
Not good, dude. We better find a way to chill out.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Dude, how can you be so calm!?
Happy - Well, I'll be counting on you, man.

Junpei Iori
Sad - I hate going back to the dorm at a time like this...
I wonder what's gonna happen...

Junpei Iori
Ryoji seems kinda mysterious, doesn't he?
Surprised - Ya know, I thought the same thing about you the first time I saw ya.
You, Aigis, and now Ryoji. For some reason, everyone who transfers to this class seems that way.

Junpei Iori
Sometimes, I start heading to the hospital without even realizing it...
Today was one of those days.
Sad - Chidori... Why'd she...?

Junpei Iori
Well, tomorrow's the day...
Happy - Lately, it seems like everything we talk about is so depressing. Why don't we have some fun?
Happy - Come on, whaddaya say?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure.
I'm not in the mood.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Yeah, baby. That's the spirit.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Cheer up, dude. Just follow your instincts!
Happy - We need to liven things up around here.

Junpei Iori
Man, why did we have to come to school today?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I know, right?
Just deal with it.

Junpei Iori
Sad - We should've had today off...

Junpei Iori
Angry - But it's the day after the school trip!
Sad - We should've had today off...

Junpei Iori
Ryoji is absent today, man.
Class seems so quiet without him.
I never realized 'til now, but he had the sorta presence that'd liven up a room.

Junpei Iori
Dude, Aigis just flew out the door...
And Ryoji didn't turn up today either.
Sad - Weird, huh?

Junpei Iori
Man, I don't have a good feeling about today...
Sad - I wonder what's gonna happen...

Junpei Iori
Sad - There's no way I can concentrate on school now, man.
Sad - Let's get going.

Junpei Iori
Ryoji hasn't been coming to school...
I wonder what he's been up to...

Junpei Iori
Dude, this is crazy...
How am I supposed to think about exams when the world's coming to an end?

Junpei Iori
Sad - Dude, all my energy is gone...
Sad - Call a taxi... I can't walk home.
Sad - ......
Just kidding. I'll manage.

Junpei Iori
This is bullshit, man.
Who cares about test results when the world's coming to an end?
Happy - Either way, it's depressing news.

Junpei Iori
I should get to enjoy winter break after the roughest semester of my life...
But instead, we've got a frickin' impossible decision to make.
Exasperated* - This sucks.

Junpei Iori
Dude, can you believe how many people are into this cult thing?
It's messed up, if you ask me.

Junpei Iori
Don't you think it's hard not to stare at people talking about cult stuff?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I agree.
Not really.

Junpei Iori
I try not to, but I can't help it.
Angry - Sometimes I stare too long and they start getting suspicious.

Junpei Iori
I know, I know... It's better to just ignore them.

Junpei Iori
We better think this through...
Man, now I sound like a teacher.
Who would've thought that would happen?

Junpei Iori
Dude, doesn't that empty seat bother you?
Happy - Every time I look at it, it reminds me of him.
Happy - If Ryoji were to walk in and sit down like nothing happened, how would you react?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'd be excited.
That's not gonna happen.

Junpei Iori
Me too. Wouldn't that be sweet?

Junpei Iori
Yeah, I know.
But I can't stop thinking about it.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Why bother doing anything at all when the world's gonna end!?
Surprised - That's what some guy told me, anyway.

Junpei Iori
When I was talking to Ms. Toriumi about my future, she laughed when I told her I had big plans...
Happy - But who cares, right? We're goin' up against Nyx.
Happy - We'll be eaten alive if we don't think big.

Junpei Iori
This might sound weird coming from me, but school isn't so bad.
Happy - I'm actually looking forward to coming back here once this is all over.

Junpei Iori
Happy - I came to check out the weapons here. Man, don't they look great?
Happy - They've got that new weapon smell.

Junpei Iori
You know I use two-handed swords, right? Someday, I'm gonna find it...
Happy - The LEGENDARY SWORD!

Minato Arisato - Selection
There's no need...
Good luck.
Find me one too.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - How can you deny a man's passion like that!? That's cold!
Happy - C'mon, you've gotta dream big!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Thanks! I'm gonna do my best.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Sure thing! Let's hope we can find one each.

Junpei Iori
I came to pick some swimwear for Yakushima, but I dunno which one to get.
I asked Sanada-san, but he doesn't give a crap about fashion.
Happy - So it's up to you, dude! Tell me what I should bring!

Minato Arisato - Selection
Trunks.
Swim briefs.
A one-piece bathing suit.
A red loincloth.

Junpei Iori
The basics, huh? I dunno, is that the style I should go for?

Junpei Iori
That's not really my thing... I don't have the body for it, y'know?

Junpei Iori
I thought of that once. It'll get a laugh, at least!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Hell yeah! That's a REAL Japanese man's swimwear!
Happy - Pfft, yeah, right. I can't wear that! Wear it yourself!

Junpei Iori
Happy - C'mon, we can't let Koromaru beat us!
Happy - Let's go to Tartarus, man!

Junpei Iori
There aren't any Lost around now, so it's all good, but...
Pretty soon, man, they're gonna start coming outta nowhere.
I'm sick of doing the same thing over and over... Let's kill all the Shadows and finish this.

Junpei Iori
The next Shadow's the last one, right?
Happy - Man, this one's going to be killer. We'll have to get decked out in our best gear to take it down!

Junpei Iori
Hey, Minato! What's up?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Just wandering around.
Nothing. What's up?

Junpei Iori
Oh, okay. Well, you just got to this town, so...
Wandering around is good! You'll get to know the place better.

Junpei Iori
I just ate, man.
All that exercise in Tartarus makes me hungry.

Junpei Iori
Those two old ladies were talking about that case.
Some people got hurt, so you know word is gonna get out all over town about this one.

Junpei Iori
Amada, huh? Hmm...
I dunno what it is about that kid, but my Junpei senses are going crazy around him.
Sad - Either he's a little punk, or he's WAY more mature than I am...
I dunno, man... Is it just me?

Junpei Iori
Damn, dude, the Lost are everywhere these days.
Happy - Maybe we should have our own theme song, y'know? "Who you gonna call? Shadowbusters!"

Junpei Iori
I came to catch a movie with my bud, but he said he couldn't make it...
So, that's today down the drain. We're gonna try again tomorrow.
I always have the worst luck on my days off...

Junpei Iori
I came to catch a movie with my bud.
But, dude, no one's showed up yet. Maybe I'm just early, but...

Junpei Iori
Amada really respects Sanada-san.
I totally understand how he feels. Dude, Sanada-san won sixteen boxing matches straight.
If I look up to the guy, then kids must think he's an actual hero, you know?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I agree.
Not really.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Hey... You think we got what it takes to be heroes? Seems impossible.

Junpei Iori
Oh, you just don't get it. It's all about passion!

Junpei Iori
Dude, isn't our group getting kinda wacky?
We got a Persona-using robot, and now there's a Persona-using dog!
Happy - What's next, man? A gorilla with the potential?

Junpei Iori
Check out the town, man. There's no Lost or anything, and it's so clean... Feels good, huh?
Sad - My brain, on the other hand, is all junky and dirty, and it feels bad.
Angry - Stupid summer school... I can't believe this...

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
No worries, dude. I got your back.
Happy - Just leave everything to me and my mad sword skills!

Minato Arisato - Selection
Thanks, man.
What skills?

Junpei Iori
Happy - You got it! Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the show, alright?
Happy - I won't disappoint!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Oh, uh...
I guess you're probably right... Maybe. Just kinda. Partially.

Junpei Iori
Hey, ya know that thing we use to summon our Personas... the Evoker?
Well, I was thinking, why's it gotta look like a gun?
Sad - I mean, you gotta be a little nutty to point a gun at your head and pull the trigger, ya know?

Junpei Iori
I was told that our Personas reflect who we are.
I think that's why my Persona is super hot-blooded.
Happy - Like, "Yo, catch these hands!"
Happy - Guess there's no hiding a strong sense of justice, and you know me—I'm a hero in the making!

Junpei Iori
Bro, don't weapons and armor cost way too much?
I mean, I gueeess quality matters... It does kinda make me feel stronger.
I know we can't be stingy when it comes to equipment, but man... My wallet is crying in pain.

Junpei Iori
Did you hear? The used bookstore at the Iwatodai strip mall just reopened.
Usually, you can find the rarest of rare manga buried somewhere at those kinda shops!
Happy - Hmmm... Maybe I should go check it out. I'm actually pretty good at digging up treasure!

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - ...Go for it, but try not to clown around there too much, all right?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Apparently, my Persona's supposed to be real strong against fire!
Happy - Call the fire department 'cause I'm burnin' with passion, baby!
Anyway, you can leave the strong enemies to me. I can take the heat!

Junpei Iori
Student council, huh...
Well, as exciting as THAT sounds... I think I'll pass.

Junpei Iori
Happy - I hear lots of gamers love Innocent Sin Online.
Well, since tomorrow's a holiday...
Happy - You should play it, dude.

Junpei Iori
Man, no one's back yet.
And we have school tomorrow... I guess that means Tartarus is a no-go?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yep, that's right.
No, we're going.

Junpei Iori
Alrighty then, time to hit the hay.

Junpei Iori
Uh, you serious? I wouldn't if I were you.
Surprised - Besides, it'd be just you and me there. You know, like, Brokeback Tartarus.
Happy - C'mon, let's be good kids and stay in tonight.

Junpei Iori
Well, let's just chill for tonight since we can't go to Tartarus anyways.

Junpei Iori
By the way, when we were fightin' in Tartarus, I was thinkin'...
Even Shadows have stuff they're not good at... Like, they have weaknesses, too.
Happy - Like how I'm not good at studying, y'know? For a sec, I thought they were kinda relatable.

Junpei Iori
Sanada-san's gotta be, like... a superhuman or something.
Didn't a Shadow injure him? But he's acting totally normal, like it was no big deal.
Normally, people wouldn't be all like, "I gotta heal up fast so I can jump back into the fight."
Sad - He really is a boxing champ. Worlds apart from us ordinary folks, huh?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - At this rate, I'm gonna spend Golden Week the same way I always have!
Happy - Lazing around, hanging out with dudes— Er, not that I don't love your company, my dude, but...
Happy - It's just sad... Too sad! Even though I'm a changed man this year!

Junpei Iori
'Sup? You got no plans today either?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yep.
I have plans.

Junpei Iori
I'm sooo bored, dude.
Sad - I can't believe that I don't have anything to do during Golden Week.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Damn, you traitor!
Sad - Well, go ahead then. The door's right there. Don't worry 'bout me. I'll just be here, doing nothing.

Junpei Iori
Hey, do you actually think about the enemy's next move and stuff during battle?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Obviously.
Not at all.

Junpei Iori
Yeah, I prolly shoulda guessed, huh?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Wait, hold up... So you're just guessing? Uh, is it really okay for a leader to do that?

Yukari Takeba
It's important to analyze the situation and quickly think of a strategy during battle.

Akihiko Sanada
I agree.
Watching the enemy's every move and thinking two steps ahead of them would be ideal.
That way, our victory would be assured. We're counting on you, Arisato.

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - Thinking and fighting at the same time is easier said than done. You think so, too, right?
Exasperated* - Thinking two steps ahead of the enemy... That'd totally fry my brain, dude.

Junpei Iori
Sanada-san and Kirijo-senpai aren't back yet. Guess we won't be going to Tartarus tonight.
Yuka-tan said she's gonna go study in her room. Hmmm... What to do, what to do...?

Junpei Iori
Man, I wish there was an easier way to get to Tartarus.
Happy - I ain't even talkin' about the climbin'. 'Cause first, we gotta go all the way to school, right?
Surprised - But what if I just opened my door and it leads me straight to Tartarus!? Now that would be nifty.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Stop spewing nonsense already...
Exasperated* - Why on earth would anyone want their door to be connected to Tartarus?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Kirijo-senpai is gorgeous, but, man, she's real scary, too.
Sad - But it's true the number of cases 'round here has been going up...
It doesn't feel right to just sit tight and do nothing at a time like this.

Junpei Iori
Hey, don'tcha think there's been way too many Apathy Syndrome cases lately?
Wouldn't it be real bad if we don't do anything about it...?
I guess all we can do right now is focus on beating up the Shadows in Tartarus...

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Oh man... I seriously thought we were all goners yesterday.
But you saved our ass when you pulled that brake! I'm so glad you were there, dude.
Happy - It's so good to be alive...

Junpei Iori
You know how Shadows come up and attack whenever they see us?
But once they see that we're waaay stronger than them, they'll try running away?
Happy - Every time we catch up to 'em, they look like they got the bejeezus scared outta 'em at the start of the battle.
I kinda feel bad for 'em, but... oh well, lucky us!

Junpei Iori
Why the heck would anyone think I could fix the command room equipment?
Computers ain't my field, dude.
All I know how to fix is a TV. You just smack the top and voilà!

Junpei Iori
Yuka-tan went to borrow notes, huh? She must be serious about studying for the exams...
Sad - I guess I should get crackin' too... Ugh, what a pain.
Happy - Yeah, I'll just worry about it tomorrow.

Junpei Iori
Nobody's gonna die if they skip a day of studying! Am I right or am I right?
Happy - Anyways, times like this call for a change of pace! How do you feel about hittin' up Tartarus?

Junpei Iori
Sad - Studying is actually all about stamina, you know?
So I need to get fit and improve my stamina, which means working out and getting a good night's sleep...
Happy - Hm... Well, guess I don't got time for studying.

Junpei Iori
How's the studying goin'? Smooth sailing?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yep.
Nope.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Man, you're one serious student, aren'tcha? Unlike me. I haven't even started!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Reeeally now? Well, I ain't buyin' it!
Happy - It's a proven fact that people who say they don't study actually secretly study their asses off!

Junpei Iori
Happy - I-I was studying... and I just came out here for a quick break.
Sad - Okay, so maybe that's not true.
Sad - I started out fine, but then I got lazy.
Sad - I don't know how everyone can study so much...

Junpei Iori
What a bummer, am I right? There could've been another girl on the team...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, real bummer.
No, not really...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Right!? I knew I wasn't the only one who felt that way!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Seriously? Well, I guess you are a bit of the "I work alone" kinda guy.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Yeah, my grades were... Well, they were what I expected.
Sad - Aw, just leave me alone, man...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Dude, my Persona just keeps getting stronger and stronger!
Happy - I feel like I can take on any enemy now.
Okay, well, maybe not "any" enemy, but I do feel like I've gotten a lot better than before!
Sad - Now, if only my grades would go up, too...

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Huh, I guess you do have some self-awareness.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - H-Hey, don't make this serious! It was just one of those self-deprecating jokes...
Sad - Ugh... Now I'm depressed for real.

Junpei Iori
We are saving the city, right, Sanada-san?

Akihiko Sanada
Well, yeah... Why state the obvious?

Junpei Iori
Well, 'cause... it doesn't really feel like it.
It'd just be nice if we could get some kinda thank-you...
From the ladies, at least.

Junpei Iori
Yuka-tan's freakin' out, for no reason!
All I said to her was that someone might be in her room... or under her bed... or in her closet.
I mean, come on, that's nothing to get all worked up about, right?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I agree.
That's scary.

Junpei Iori
Hm... Maybe Yuka-tan's more of a scaredy-cat than I thought.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Wait, seriously?
All she'll probably see is one of those big-ass cockroaches. ...Well, I guess that would be pretty scary too.

Junpei Iori
Yuka-tan is way too scared of nothing, don'tcha think? It's not like any of that is real.

Junpei Iori
Damn, rumors spread fast, especially this one.
Everyone at school knows about it... And soon everyone in town will, too.

Junpei Iori
Happy - I thought those stories were all fake...
Happy - But she seems to be doing actual research on them.
Happy - Is this the power of Junpei's Believe It, or Don't?

Yukari Takeba
Angry - What. You got a problem!?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Yikes... She's seriously pissed, man.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Dude, there are rumors all over school. Don't people have anything better to talk about?
Now how are we supposed to figure out what's true or not? It's hopeless!

Junpei Iori
I heard people gather there a couple times a month...
The baddest of the bad all get together... It looks like a reunion for a bunch of ex-convicts.
Surprised - And apparently they're gonna be there tomorrow...
Sad - Isn't that really bad? What if we run into them!?

Junpei Iori
Sad - I told you it wasn't a good idea to go there, dude.
Sad - If Aragaki-san hadn't helped us, who knows what would've happened to us...? Ugh, I'm getting an ulcer just thinkin' about it.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - I said I was sorry! I didn't think it would be that bad.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Well, now you know! Next time, have a little more faith in what I say.
Anyways, there's no way in hell I'm ever settin' foot in that place again!

Junpei Iori
Kirijo-senpai and Sanada-san are both at the hospital checking up on Yamagishi.
That means no Tartarus tonight. Guess we gotta find something random to do to kill some time.

Junpei Iori
Finally! A new addition to this dorm!
Happy - Oh man, I'm so stoked! Hm, maybe I should clean my room...

Junpei Iori
Dude, she's the exact opposite of Yuka-tan... Smart, kind, modest...
Happy - Hey, Minato, whaddaya think of her?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Not bad.
I don't really care...
That all you think about?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Right!?
Happy - Finally, a nice change of pace!

Junpei Iori
Seriously? Man, nothing moves you, huh.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Dude, you need to lighten up.
Happy - Keep up the attitude, and you'll be wastin' your youth.

Junpei Iori
Happy - I can't wait! A new, exciting addition to our lives, soothing our souls!
Happy - Man, I'm so glad I live here!

Junpei Iori
The girls said no guys allowed... But what if they need more help carrying the heavier stuff?
Happy - Well, I guess they'll call for us if they really need the help.

Junpei Iori
I heard Fuuka's teacher, Mr. Ekoda, got in a lot of trouble.
It must've been because of Kirijo-senpai...
Surprised - Scary, huh? Beware the power of Kirijo!

Junpei Iori
Sad - Dude, I almost got in trouble with the police today...
I was damn lucky it was just a false alarm.

Junpei Iori
Fuuka will be supporting us... *sigh* She has the voice of an angel.
Happy - Don't get me wrong, Kirijo-senpai has a nice voice too. It's just that Fuuka's is just so calm and soothing.

Junpei Iori
Hey, do you think Apathy Syndrome can be cured?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, I believe so.
No, I don't think so.

Junpei Iori
Yeah, maybe if we defeat a Shadow, the spirits it ate will return to their owners.
But then again, they might just get digested.

Junpei Iori
Huh... Guess that makes Apathy Syndrome an incurable disease.
Sad - Whoa, dude... I'm starting to feel the pressure.

Junpei Iori
Happy - All we have to do is defeat the remaining eight, right?
Happy - Then let's do it, man! That way, everything will go back to normal.

Junpei Iori
Koromaru is really one of a kind, huh...

Fuuka Yamagishi
He really is, and such an obedient boy, too.
He always seems to be at the shrine... I wonder if he's eating okay.

Junpei Iori
Why don't we just keep him here? I feel like Kirijo-senpai would say yes.
I mean, doesn't she seem like the type to have a Doberman at home?
Happy - And she'd feed it the highest quality filet mignon...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Junpei-kun... I think you read too much manga.

Junpei Iori
I mean, sure I feel excited...
Happy - But that doesn't mean I'm treating this like a game, y'know? I just really want to take 'em down.

Junpei Iori
Shadows come in all shapes and sizes, huh.
Well, they're all creepy as hell... I wonder how they ended up looking the way they do.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Dude... Why's he even here?

Junpei Iori
Ahem. Junpei the Wise has come to a startling conclusion.
Happy - ...There is no top to Tartarus!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Whoa, he's finally snapped... I guess his brain has reached its expiration date.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Actually, that's an interesting idea... It's almost philosophical.
Happy - But, wouldn't that create a big problem for us?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Uh, yeah, I guess so...
Happy - Alright, then... Tartarus DOES have a top, after all! Let's leave it as that.

Junpei Iori
Hmmm, what's up with Yuka-tan...?
It's like she's glaring daggers every time she looks at Kirijo-senpai.

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's true.
It's just your imagination.

Junpei Iori
Right? I wonder what happened...
Happy - Maybe Senpai ate Yuka-tan's last bonbon.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Yeah, maybe you're right. At least, I sure hope so.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Hey, Minato, have you heard? Shadows are attacking couples now.
Happy - I bet the Shadow behind it is one jealous and lonely son of a gun. How sad.

Junpei Iori
A full moon, huh...
There's not much to do once we're done prepping, and the wait is pretty boring...
Man, there's seriously nothing to do... Maybe I'll swing by the shrine tomorrow.

Junpei Iori
The Shadows just keep gettin' stronger, huh...
Even if we train harder, it's always gonna end up a close match, right?
Sad - Reality is harsh, man...
Sad - What if we hit our limit one day and get our asses kicked? That'd be totally lame...

Junpei Iori
It's almost the full moon!
Happy - Anyways, just leave everything to me! I'll take out the enemy in the blink of an eye!
Happy - Oh man, I'm so pumped... I sure hope I can get some sleep tonight.

Junpei Iori
Angry - ...What. Were you going to order me around, O High and Mighty Leader?
Angry - Tch, whatever... I can be just as good as you, too.

Junpei Iori
Angry - Well, aren't you calm. Must be 'cause you're a fantastic leader who can do anything, huh.
Angry - No matter what happens, you can handle it all by yourself... Isn't that right?
Angry - Ha... I wish a nobody like me could be like that.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Junpei-kun, are you listening?
The only thing anyone knows about Tartarus is that it creates Shadows...
Sad - Other than that, we're all in the dark...

Junpei Iori
I'm so stoked for Yakushima, but that's one thing...
You're as calm as ever, huh. I wish I had your chill.

Junpei Iori
Happy - We should just take this time to forget about all the bad things that have been happening, and have some fun!

Minato Arisato - Selection
You're right.
I don't really want to...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Yeah! We're gonna have an awesome time!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Tsk, tsk, tsk... I'm very disappointed in you.
Happy - Do I have to force you to have fun? I'll make you have fun whether you like it or not!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Dude, I'm so ready for this! Look out, ladies, here I come!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - *sigh* Is that all you think about, Junpei-kun...?

Yukari Takeba
You sure know how to leave your troubles behind...
Angry - I wish I could let things go as easily as you do...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - ......

Junpei Iori
You gotta live life to the fullest! And how're you gonna do that if you're always stuck moping?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I know you're right, but still...

Junpei Iori
She's super cute, huh?
She's super cute, but made out of steel...
Sad - It's new territory for me... Honestly, I don't know how to approach this.

Junpei Iori
Exam scores!? Dude, I don't care about that!
Happy - Defeating Shadows is more important than getting good grades!
Happy - Any time spent studying could be used to go to Tartarus and—


Mitsuru Kirijo
Exasperated* - Don't get carried away, Iori. You should still study.
Happy - You can learn from defeat... That's something that goes for our battles against Shadows as well.

Junpei Iori
Amada, huh... And he's still in elementary school? Man, that's young.
I dunno what it is about that kid, but my Junpei senses are going crazy around him.
Either he's a little punk, or he's WAY more mature than I am...
I dunno, man... Is it just me?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Damn, I never thought of that!
Sad - If that happens, how will I shop at the convenience store?

Yukari Takeba
I guess the concept is too big for your brain to comprehend...
Exasperated* - You're an idiot, ya know that?

Junpei Iori
I wonder if the next Shadow will be even stronger.
Maybe they'll be drained and weak 'cause of the summer heat...? Nah, not happenin'.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - A city in chaos, huh... Sounds like something out of a movie...
Sad - But what's real scary is that it can totally happen... And we're the only ones who can do anything about it.

Junpei Iori
Amada really respects Sanada-san.
I totally understand how he feels. Dude, Sanada-san won sixteen boxing matches straight.
If I look up to the guy, then kids must think he's an actual hero, you know?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I agree.
Not really.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Hey... You think we got what it takes to be heroes? Seems impossible.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Oh, you just don't get it. It's all about passion!

Junpei Iori
Dude, isn't our group getting kinda wacky?
We got a Persona-using robot, and now there's a Persona-using dog!
Happy - What's next, man? A gorilla with the potential?

Junpei Iori
I totally get that feel when you're all fired up 'cause there's someone better than you.
But take it easy from time to time, alright?

Junpei Iori
Winning tournaments is cool and all, yeah, but now it's time for the real battle!
And for us, losin' ain't an option. Get ready for some action.

Junpei Iori
Happy - It's about time for the next full moon. Let's kick some ass again!
Happy - Heh, I'll send all our enemies flying outta the park! Look forward to seeing some ultra cool moves!

Junpei Iori
It's honestly hot as hell... But at least I'm one cool dude!
Happy - Anyways, you know you can always count on me, right? Our enemies got nothing on me!

Junpei Iori
Sad - Dude, our missions are always so exhausting.
But last night was even worse 'cause we ran into those Strega guys.
Angry - And they look like a pretty annoying bunch. Man... I wish they'd just piss off.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Dude, our missions are always so exhausting.
But last night was even worse 'cause we ran into those Strega guys.
Angry - And they look like a pretty annoying bunch. Man... I wish they'd just piss off.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Man, this sucks...
Sad - Our long awaited summer vacation has been ruined by stupid summer school!

Minato Arisato - Selection
Totally.
Not really.
I love learning.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Sometimes I wish I had Apathy Syndrome... Then, I wouldn't have to think about school anymore.

Junpei Iori
Man, how can you stay so focused?
Sad - I wish I could be like that...

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Are you freakin' kidding me!? Dude, you're such a nerd.

Junpei Iori
Happy - That's it! Junpei the Wise has yet another brilliant idea!
Happy - All I have to do is become a dog! Then, I won't have to go to summer school either!

Koromaru
Grrr... Woof! Woof!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Hm? Koro-chan is trying to say something...

Junpei Iori
Happy - I bet he's complimenting me for being so smart.

Yukari Takeba
I bet he's laughing at you, saying how stupid you are... Stupei!

Junpei Iori
There's gonna be a summer festival at the shrine tomorrow. You goin'?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Of course.
Not sure yet.
I'll pass.

Junpei Iori
Really? Well, I probably won't go.
Sad - I'm in a bit of a financial crisis. Plus, I don't have anyone to go with.

Junpei Iori
Welp, the choice is yours. You should go if you're curious about it.

Junpei Iori
Yeah, I probably won't go either.

Junpei Iori
No money, no girlfriend... I guess I'm not going to the festival.
Sad - Man, it's freakin' hot out. My room feels like a sauna.

Junpei Iori
Going into battle at his age... Amada's da MAN!
Happy - If he sticks with me, I'll show him how it's done! He can call me Junpei-senpai.

Yukari Takeba
Stop acting like a little kid... Amada-kun's more mature than you are.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Ahahahaha! Oh man, I'm dyin' here...
Happy - Yuka-tan said that the food she made didn't turn out the way she expected...
Happy - But even Koromaru ran away from it! How bad does your cooking have to be for that to happen?

Junpei Iori
Sad - Damn, it's hot... Why's it so hot inside, too?
Sad - Heeelp, I'm melting...

Junpei Iori
I can't believe that Strega guy went to the shrine, too...
And why was he half-naked!? Is it 'cause it's summer?

Junpei Iori
Sad - It's sooo hooot... I wanna eat something that's ice-cold.
Sad - Someone... bring me ice cream... please...

Junpei Iori
There are all kinds of people out there, huh...
You know those gothic lolitas, right? They still dress themselves up from head to toe in frills even in this heat...
I saw one drawing all this weird art in a notebook.
Felt like she was living in a different world, dude.

Junpei Iori
Angry - Homework is insignificant, compared to Tartarus! We must unlock our hidden potential to defeat the evil Shadows!
Angry - Yes! We have an important mission!

Fuuka Yamagishi
I think homework is also an important mission...

Yukari Takeba
Yeah, and I'm sure Senpai would agree.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - ......

Junpei Iori
I'm bored outta my mind...
But I don't feel sleepy, and I've already cleared all of my games...

Junpei Iori
Dude, Amada wasn't lookin' so good...
I think he's got heat exhaustion. Poor kid...
Kids his age should be outside, playin'. You know, have some fun, build up some stamina.

Junpei Iori
Hey, is there anything you can think of that I'm super into?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I wouldn't know.
That's for you to discover.
Nope.

Junpei Iori
That's true... Why am I asking you?

Junpei Iori
Yeah, you're right... I have to figure it out on my own.

Junpei Iori
Hey, you didn't even think about it... But you're probably right.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Well, I guess there's no point asking other people. Something I'm passionate about... Hmmm...

Junpei Iori
Chidori, huh...
All things considered, she's a bit of a weirdo...

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
Dude, let's be real: she's seriously cute...
I bet she'll be super popular. Tons of guys are gonna have a crush on her.
But what if someone finds out that she's... you know. 'Cause of the way she walks, the way she talks...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Aragaki-san kicks ass, man! I'm never gonna forget what he did for us back at the alley.
Happy - With him back on the team, ain't nothin' gonna take us down!

Junpei Iori
Happy - What's up, Minato? Being a hero's so cool!
Happy - I can't wait until tomorrow, dude!

Junpei Iori
Sad - ......
Sad - Sorry, but I need some time to myself.

Junpei Iori
Hey, let's say, hypothetically...
Someone tells me they want to die. So I tell this person I don't want them to die.
What do you think? Is it weird to say that?

Minato Arisato - Selection
It's not weird to me.
Yeah, kinda.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Oh, good to hear... Thanks.

Junpei Iori
You're right... I'm always acting like a total oddball when I'm around her.

Junpei Iori
Have you ever thought about what you're living for?

Minato Arisato - Selection
To a certain extent.
Not at all.

Junpei Iori
Wow, never took you for the philosophical type.

Junpei Iori
I didn't before either. But I've been thinking about it a lot lately...
...Especially when I look at her. She makes me think about the reason I'm alive.

Junpei Iori
But, seriously, what am I living for...? I've never thought about something like that 'til now.

Junpei Iori
With Aragaki-san around, the atmosphere is so much more serious...

Aigis
With Junpei-san around, the atmosphere is so much more childish...

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Ouch! That hurt, Ai-chan.
Surprised - I don't even got a comeback for that.

Junpei Iori
Yo, I heard there's a typhoon heading this way, dude.
I hope it doesn't just pass by...
Because if it did, we wouldn't get a day off, so we'd have to walk to school in the rain.
Surprised - And that would totally suck!

Junpei Iori
Yeah, Chidori's gonna need some time to cool down.
So, I'm gonna give her some space before even thinkin' about going steady—and no shortcuts, of course.
Happy - And yeah, it's gonna be hard, but I don't think that's a bad thing. For her, it's worth it.

Junpei Iori
The only downside to canceling the school festival is that we won't get to see Yuka-tan in a maid dress anymore.
Bummer, huh?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, bummer.
Who cares?

Junpei Iori
I know, right?
I'm pretty sure it's not just us who're bummed out though.

Junpei Iori
Huh? Whaddaya mean you don't care!?

Junpei Iori
You know, they say idiots never get sick.
Wait... That means, since you got sick, you're smart, and since I didn't, I'm an—

Happy - W-Well, what do "they" know anyways?

Junpei Iori
Dude, that typhoon was crazy! Everything was flying through the air...
Well, not everything, I guess.
I mean, I didn't see a ramen stand flying through the air like in manga.
I wish I could've seen that in person...

Junpei Iori
Happy - I wish the typhoon was on our side...
Happy - Maybe it could blow an entire ramen stand into a Shadow and kill it with one hit!
Happy - Wouldn't that be awesome!?

Aigis
......

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - ......

Fuuka Yamagishi
Exasperated* - ......

Junpei Iori
Surprised - ......

Junpei Iori
Happy - Yo, Minato. How're ya doin', dude?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'm okay.
Not so great.

Junpei Iori
Happy - It's okay to be okay! After all, there are people who need my positive energy to cheer up!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Aw, seriously? C'mon, man...
Happy - You're young! Have some fun, live a little!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Maybe I should try doing a personalized training regimen like Sanada-san.
Happy - Since Chidori's getting better, I've been thinking I should start working harder, too.

Junpei Iori
You know what they say about cornered animals, right?
That they'll get desperate and fight back.
Well, do you think the same thing is true for a Shadow?

Aigis
Would its combat power amplify when under great pressure?
I cannot say with the utmost certainty, but we should be prepared for that possibility.
I believe it would be more beneficial if we continue to build our strength. There is no such thing as being too strong, after all.

Junpei Iori
Dude, get this—my relationship with Chidori was practically sabotaged! Sabotaged, I say!

Minato Arisato - Selection
Okay, let's hear it.
Sorry, not interested.

Junpei Iori
You know how I've been spending all my time at the hospital lately?
Well, there's this old lady who works reception there.
Surprised - And, dude, she's sooo annoying! She's always asking me all these embarrassing questions!
Surprised - And whenever she doesn't, she just tells me to leave 'cause it's past visiting hours!
Sad - She's totally wasting all the time I coulda spent with Chidori! Man, if only she'd just leave me alone.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Aw, c'mon, ol' buddy, ol' friend, ol' pal o' mine! Be a bro and hear me out?

Junpei Iori
You can leave the next operation to me!
Happy - I got your back! It's totally cool with me, so no worries!

Junpei Iori
How do you think Strega's gonna come at us this time?
Happy - Since Chidori's on my side now, they don't have anyone to give 'em support!
Happy - They're like a jock strap without a protective cup!

Junpei Iori
Sad - Aragaki-san was such a badass... all the way 'til the very end.
Sad - You know, when he was all like, "This is how it should be"...
Sad - His last words just keep echoing in my head...
Sad - Do you think yours would leave that kinda impact, too?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Of course.
No way.
Yours could, too.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Wow... I don't think I could ever say somethin' like that.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Same here... I don't think I could ever say somethin' like that.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Hah, no way, dude... I don't have the balls to say somethin' like that.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Aragaki-san is really something... A normal person could never do what he did.

Junpei Iori
Happy - He's a lot tougher than I thought, dude...
Happy - I'd be so depressed... for like, three whole days maybe. Or even a week.
Happy - But he bounced back in just one day? Geez, that kid's nuts!

Junpei Iori
I know, I know. I should be studying.
But I just can't concentrate.
Sad - We lost so much, man...
Sad - Why, Aragaki-san...?

Junpei Iori
I have, like, zero motivation, man. I mean, I did try to study since exams are comin' up, but...
Sad - I dunno, I just can't get over things that quickly...

Junpei Iori
Oh yeah, baby! Exams are over! Who cares about the scores!?
Happy - I'm gonna hang out with Chidori!

Junpei Iori
Whew... No F's...
Now I don't have to go to Aragaki-san's grave and tell him I failed.

Junpei Iori
I'm just gonna sleep when the Dark Hour disappears for good.
'Cause it's freakin' exhausting fighting in Tartarus.
I just want a good night's sleep for once... A nice, peaceful sleep!

Yukari Takeba
Sounds good. I'd like to get some beauty sleep, too. My skin could use a little TLC...

Aigis
With a little maintenance, my body would look as good as new.
Would you like to join me for some maintenance, Yukari-san?

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Uh, yeah, no, I don't think that's possible.

Junpei Iori
Everything will go back to normal once we defeat the next enemy.
Happy - Honestly, it makes me feel a little sad, but... an ordinary life is definitely better.
Happy - I'd get to hang out with my friends and do stupid stuff together, and meet Chidori more often...
Happy - Anyways, let's beat that final Shadow six ways to Sunday, dude!

Junpei Iori
Fuuka's really changed, hasn't she? I wonder if it's 'cause Moriyama's moving out of town.
But, then again, wouldn't you normally feel down when that happens?
Man, I just don't get girls...

Junpei Iori
Is it just me, or...
Is Sanada-san kinda different now? Like, he doesn't feel the same as before.

Minato Arisato - Selection
You're right.
It's just your imagination.

Junpei Iori
After everything that's happened, he didn't lose hope. Instead, he's all fired up.
Aragaki-san was amazing, yeah... but so is Sanada-san.
Sad - They're like the definition of a dynamic duo. I wish I can be as strong as them one day.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Nuh-uh! He's got a totally different aura, man. Take a closer look next time.
Happy - Like, when he comes back from a jog, you can practically see the smoke comin' off him. Man's on fire.

Junpei Iori
Okay, this is kind of a weird question, but I just gotta ask...
Will my time as a superhero end once we're done fighting?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, I guess so.
Well, obviously.

Junpei Iori
Yeah... That's what I thought.

Junpei Iori
Well, that's fine with me, honestly.
Happy - It won't change the bond I have with Chidori!
Happy - I'll just enjoy being a superhero for as long as it lasts!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Whoa! Easy, dude! No need to be so harsh!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Well, even if I won't be a superhero anymore, it won't change what I have with Chidori...
Happy - So let's take care of business as usual! Victory will be ours!

Junpei Iori
Koromaru is friggin' awesome, dude!
He's not afraid of fighting Shadows, even though he's so small.
Happy - Alright, the next Shadow I take down is dedicated to Koromaru!

Junpei Iori
Sad - I've been so busy lately that I haven't been able to visit Chidori...
Happy - Well, we're almost done.
Happy - After we kill the last Shadow, I'm gonna run straight to the hospital to see her!

Junpei Iori
Hey, I almost forgot... We have tomorrow off.
I'll probably just stay home and rest, though. Gotta prepare for the last operation, too.
Happy - Let's give it everything we've got tomorrow!

Junpei Iori
Angry - Ugh, can't believe we respected that scumbag Ikutsuki so much...
Angry - Dude, I'm so pissed off. This would be a great time for one of those memory erasers.
Angry - I'm never gonna trust another adult ever again.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Chidori... What happened to you...?

Junpei Iori
Sad - I don't understand... What happened to Chidori...?

Junpei Iori
Sad - Maybe I should try visiting her again, but... Hm...
Sad - I dunno what to say to her... If only I had some kinda reason to see her.

Junpei Iori
So I went to the hospital to see Chidori...
Sad - And she just ignored me the whole time.
Hm... Guess I'm in a bit of a pinch here. Might have to stay up all night comin' up with jokes to get her to smile...

Junpei Iori
Oh, hey, man... Hear me out, will ya?
So when I got to Chidori's hospital room, I braced myself and dropped my best one-liner...
And, to no one's surprise, Chidori ignored me again... But the judging looks everyone gave me was the absolute worst. Ugh.

Junpei Iori
Was she just in a bad mood that day...?
Sad - Maybe I should go see her... But, then again... Hrm...

Junpei Iori
Hm? Who's mysterious? Ryoji?
Psh! That's just his MO.
He's just trying to charm the ladies by acting all secretive.
Happy - In reality, he's just a normal, good-looking guy—like me!

Junpei Iori
So I went to visit Chidori, and lo and behold... she gave me the cold shoulder.
Happy - So I did everything I could, made a big fool of myself, and came crawling right back!

Junpei Iori
Sad - Even if I visit Chidori now, she's just going to reject me...
Surprised - Argh! I can't believe I've been moping about this for an entire week already!

Junpei Iori
Sanada-san is going through a tough time, too...
This is bad, man. What if the third-years decide to quit SEES?
I don't know if we can handle things on our own, man.

Ken Amada
Sad - Junpei-san! Don't say that sort of thing...

Junpei Iori
In this world, there are things you can't change.
So, it's better to focus on those things you can.
Got that, bro?
Happy - Basically, what I'm tryin' to say is... let's have a blast on the school trip!

Junpei Iori
Sad - Speaking of memories...
Sad - We sure had a rough time in the hot spring, huh? Like, we were seriously unlucky!
Sad - Argh, if only the girls were less prone to executions... I don't even wanna think about it anymore.

Junpei Iori
Hm? Memories of our Kyoto trip?
......
I, uh... don't remember anything at all. Nope, nada, zilch.

Junpei Iori
Happy - I've got a new strategy! I'll tell Chidori all about our school trip! We're bound to get closer after that!
Sad - Or, at least, I think so. I'm not really confident it'll work out though...

Junpei Iori
Sad - Chidori wouldn't be happy with me if I kept moping around like this, huh?

Minato Arisato - Selection
You're right.
We all get it.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Yeah, I know... I know that...
Sad - I know I need to move on, and I'm trying to forget about it, but I just can't.
Sad - Now I get what it's like... to have your heart broken.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Heh, ya tryna cheer me up or something?
Sad - But, thanks... I'll try to get out of this funk.

Junpei Iori
I've made up my mind. I'm going to fight and get rid of the Dark Hour.
I'll fight, get rid of the Dark Hour, end everything, and live for the both of us...
Crying - For me and— A-And Ch-Chi...
Crying - Sorry... I'm not feeling up to much today. Maybe tomorrow.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Oh, what's up? Heads up, Ryoji and I are hanging out in my room right now.
Happy - But he's not stayin' for long, so just holler if you're gonna head to Tartarus.
Hmm, which soda did he want...?

Junpei Iori
Sad - This feels kinda weird, huh. There's a full moon tomorrow, but nothing's happening. It's almost too quiet...
Well, I guess that just goes to show we're back to our ordinary, everyday lives.
Hm... But for some reason... I feel a little restless.

Junpei Iori
Wasn't that a total shock?
Remember how Ai-chan was asking us about what it means to live and all that?
So much has happened, and I wonder if everything's been affecting her, too...

Junpei Iori
Sad - Ryoji... That crazy bastard. He's gotta be outta his mind, spewing all that crap outta nowhere.
Sad - This is such bullshit, man... I just don't get it.

Junpei Iori
Angry - Stupid Ryoji...
Angry - Saying the world is going to end out of nowhere...
Angry - What the hell does he mean by "the Appriser" anyways!?

Junpei Iori
Angry - That Ryoji... He just up and disappeared...
Angry - After dropping that huge bomb about the world ending and us having to make a decision by New Year's Eve...
Crying - What the hell, man...? This ain't funny.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Figures. I finally learn something about myself, and now I'm gonna die.
Sad - This is probably what Chidori meant when she said she was afraid...
Sad - Chidori... I think I finally get it now...
Sad - ......

Junpei Iori
Sad - Sorry about earlier, man... I know you've been helping me out all this time.
Sad - But you know that sinking feeling when you hit a dead end? Yeah, it sucks.

Junpei Iori
Dude, I'm in serious trouble! I haven't studied at all for the exams.
What about you?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Of course I have.
Not at all.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - What!? You're hanging me out to dry?
What the heck, we're buddies, right? Pals? Partners in crime? C'mon, join me on the road to failure!

Junpei Iori
Happy - That's why we're buddies, man!
Happy - Let's fail together!

Junpei Iori
Sad - Hmmm... Yeah, I don't think it'll make much difference even if I start studying now.
Sad - Besides, I'm not in the studyin' mood anyways...

Junpei Iori
Sad - Dude, I think I bombed the exams.
Sad - But how could I even concentrate when I know the world is gonna end...?

Junpei Iori
Angry - Those Strega dumbasses haven't made a move yet, huh?
Angry - They better hurry up and show their faces.
I dunno what they're up to, but I'm gonna crush 'em either way.

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - I'm with you there.
Angry - I'm not gonna let them get away after what they did to Shinji and Chidori.

Koromaru
Angry - ...Arf!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Looks like Koromaru's on board, too. Aren'tcha, bud?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Christmas is almost here! Ya excited for it?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Of course.
No, not really.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Cool! Let's enjoy Christmas!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - C'mon, don't give up just yet!
Surprised - This might be our last Christmas!
Happy - You gotta enjoy it while it lasts, dude!

Junpei Iori
Happy - We've got this! Let's make this Christmas one we won't ever forget!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Hey, man, looks like it's gonna be a lonely Christmas for both of us!
Happy - So we should let loose and go wild tonight! You wanna hit the town, just the two of us?

Minato Arisato - Selection
No way in hell.
That's not a bad idea.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Dude, take it easy.
Happy - I was just kidding, so don't get your panties in a bunch.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - I was just kidding, dude! Don't think too hard on it.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Well, well, well... Don't someone look like the cat that got the cream.
Sad - From what I heard, you got home late last night, too.
Sad - Why you gotta flaunt it, man...? I'm so jealous...

Junpei Iori
The last exams were frickin' hard, weren't they?
I bombed all of them. And not just me. All of my friends were worried about it, too.
But, compared to everything that's going on...
Sad - My bad grades don't seem all that important, heh.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Chidori gave up her own life... so that I could live.
Happy - That's why I can't take this lying down. Like hell I'm fine with forgetting her.
Happy - I'd rather die than forget.

Junpei Iori
Hey, did something happen to Ai-chan when she was getting repaired?
She seems so... different...
It's almost like she's human. Hm... I dunno, it's hard to explain.

Junpei Iori
Ryoji's not here yet? Dude, where the hell is he?

Junpei Iori
Happy - I knew it, man. I knew that's what you would do.

Junpei Iori
Hey, good timing. You get me, right?
When you think of a kimono, you think of a chick with a great figure going "commando," right?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Ask someone else.
Yep, totally.
No comment.

Junpei Iori
C'mon, dude. Don't play dumb. You know it's every guy's fantasy!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Ha! I knew you'd agree! It's great to have like-minded friends!

Junpei Iori
C'mon, dude. Don't play dumb... You're just suppressing your true feelings.
Happy - I bet you're gonna go back to your room and fantasize about it.

Junpei Iori
It's the new year and all, but it sure doesn't feel that way...
Everything's all about the cult or the end of the world... It's seriously killing the mood.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Have you seen what that cult did?
Sad - It's a total mess out there! How sick in the head do you gotta be to pull off a stunt like that?

Junpei Iori
School's starting again. I wonder how everyone's doing...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Probably the same.
Brainwashed by the cult.

Junpei Iori
That's true. We didn't have a long enough vacation for anyone to change.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Y-You're joking, right?
Surprised - I mean, you can't be serious...
Sad - ...'cause if that's how it's gonna be, I'm not going, dude!

Junpei Iori
Damn Strega... We don't have time to play hide and seek.
We better find them, before they make more trouble for us.
Why don't we let Koromaru sniff them out?

Koromaru
Arf...?

Junpei Iori
Looks like the college entrance exams are on the 16th and 17th of this month.
I bet Sanada-san and Kirijo-senpai are both gonna ace it.
They try to hide it, but it's pretty obvious that they study all the time.

Junpei Iori
Oh yeah, we have tomorrow off for... Uh, what was it again?
Ah, right, it's Coming of Age Day.
Sad - Like I said before, I just hope I can even make it to my twentieth birthday...

Junpei Iori
Angry - Who's the dumbass in charge of that cult?
Angry - Here we are bustin' our asses, and they go and pull this crap.

Aigis
You can't just blame the cult.
The cult exists only because there are people willing to believe in it.

Junpei Iori
Yeah... I guess that's just how the world works.
Well, that means it's up to us to do something about it.

Junpei Iori
Angry - Dammit! Can you believe those Strega assholes went and pulled that bullshit on us?
Angry - They've been runnin' their mouths about the damn cult, and now they're gonna pin the blame on us?
Angry - Yeah, ain't no way I'm lettin' 'em off easy, even if they get on their knees and beg for mercy!

Junpei Iori
Everyone being fooled by that cult better wake up, man!
Don't they know that Strega's all behind it...?
Hell, don't they have anything else to believe in other than Strega's BS sermons?

Junpei Iori
Sanada-san and Kirijo-senpai are taking college entrance exams now.
Dude, that'll be us before you know it.
Sad - Ugh, just thinking about it is making my stomach hurt...

Junpei Iori
Honestly, the thought of fighting Nyx scares the shit outta me.
Happy - But for some reason, whenever I look at Chidori's drawing, I feel like I could do anything.
Happy - She gave me her life... So there's no way I'm gonna let anyone take it from me.

Ken Amada
Surprised - Wow, Junpei-san... I always thought you were a slacker...
Happy - But now, it's almost like you're on par with Sanada-san.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Oh? Then I better bring my A game.
Happy - Let's see if we can put up a fight against Nyx.

Junpei Iori
Happy tears* - *sniffle* Minato...
Happy tears* - Today is the best day of my entire life...
Happy tears* - *sniffle*

Junpei Iori
That's right, man...
Koromaru usually only gets to eat regular dog food.
Happy - ...But it's time we give him the good stuff!

Junpei Iori
Career consultation, huh...
Why do we have to do this crap right before a battle? Dammit, I've got too much on my mind...
Sad - Ya think I can just skip it...?

Junpei Iori
See this here instant ramen?
If I think of this as the last time I'll ever eat instant ramen, I'd get all emotional about it. What about you?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, me too.
Not really.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Right? What a great discovery. It's just instant ramen. Plain ol', cheap instant ramen.
Ah, so this is what life tastes like... Soy sauce flavor.

Junpei Iori
Oh, c'mon... Can't you appreciate the little things in life?
Happy - Keep up that attitude, and you won't be much of an adult when we beat Nyx.

Junpei Iori
Alright, I'm gonna take my time and savor the taste of life today.

Junpei Iori
This month went by fast, man. It's almost time for the final showdown...
Happy - ...Alrighty, Minato! C'mon, let's make this final stretch count!

Junpei Iori
Oh, hey. Funny seeing you here.
Actually... Did you know? This is where Chidori and I first met.
She was sitting here drawing, and I decided to go up to her.
Happy - We gotta beat the last boss so that we can keep Chidori's spot safe and sound.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Chidori gave me her life... And I'm sure as hell not gonna throw it away!
Happy - I'm gonna beat the crap outta Nyx and live a long, long life!

Junpei Iori
Sad - Maybe it's about time I go visit her... But, then again... Hmm...

Junpei Iori
Sad - Tomorrow, I'll visit her for sure... But, hmm...
Sad - I dunno what to say to her... If only I had some kinda reason to see her.

Junpei Iori
Sad - I wonder what Chidori's doing right now...
Sad - Maybe I could come up with some kinda excuse to go to the hospital... Like, I caught a cold or something.

Junpei Iori
Hm... Instead of wasting my time worrying about it, I should just go and see Chidori.
But... I get this feeling that it's not the right thing to do.

Junpei Iori
I really wanna see Chidori...
Sad - But I can't just show up empty-handed, can I...? If only I had something to talk about...

Junpei Iori
Sad - Do you think she's already forgotten about me? Since I haven't gone to the hospital for a while now...
Nah, I'm sure that won't happen, but... I should probably visit her soon.

Junpei Iori
The school trip, huh...
Oh, maybe we could make up if I bring her a souvenir from Kyoto...

Junpei Iori
Sad - I know I need to go see Chidori and talk things out with her...
Looking away - I've been thinking about it for so long, but for some reason I can't bring myself to go...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It looks like Junpei still hasn't been
able to visit the hospital yet...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Come to think of it, I have the
 Junpei had his eye on.
Should I give it to him?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Give to Junpei
Reconsider

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Hey... Isn't this...?
Surprised - C'mon, let's have a little chat.

Junpei Iori
Happy - （Not Used）


Junpei Iori
（Not Used）


Minato Arisato - Selection
（Not Used）


Junpei Iori
Surprised - （Not Used）


Minato Arisato - Thoughts
If only I could give Junpei something that
would encourage him to take action...

Junpei Iori
（Not Used）


Junpei Iori
Happy - （Not Used）


Junpei Iori
Okay... I'm gonna try and talk to Chidori.
Happy - I mean, I can't blow this chance... There's no way I can back out now.

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
Dude, Amada wasn't lookin' so good...
Happy - I think he's got heat exhaustion. Poor kid...
Happy - Kids his age should be outside, playin'. You know, have some fun, build up some stamina.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Yowch! Hot, hot, hot!
Surprised - I gotta hurry or I'll miss the trailers!
Happy - But I gotta grab some grub first, or I'll keel over on my way there.
Happy - Oh, hey, Minato. I'm thinkin' of catchin' some flicks.
Happy - Wanna tag along? The lineup today is choice, man!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I go to the film festival with Junpei?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Go with him
Not now

Junpei Iori
Happy - Sweet!
Happy - Just gimme a minute to finish eating!

Junpei Iori
Amada looks pretty down...
Happy - Is it the heat or somethin'?
Happy - Kids are supposed to be in the yard, playing with their dog... There's no backyard here though.
Happy - Oh, but we DO have a dog! We could be playing with him right now!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Junpei seems busy...
I doubt he's in the mood
to go to the movies...

Junpei Iori
Happy - How'd you like the movies yesterday? Awesome, huh?
Happy - I wanna be that badass someday!
Happy - If they keep playing the same movies, I swear I'll go see them, like, ten times.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It seems like Junpei isn't interested
in seeing any other movies.

Junpei Iori
Happy - I went to the movies yesterday, and it was awesome!
Happy - I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I had to pee, but I held it in, 'cause I didn't want to miss anything!
Happy - If they keep playing the same movies, I swear I'll go see them, like, ten times.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It seems like Junpei isn't interested
in seeing any other movies.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Hey, is there anything you can think of that I'm super into?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I wouldn't know.
That's for you to discover.
No.

Junpei Iori
That's true... Why am I asking you?

Junpei Iori
Yeah, you're right... I have to figure it out on my own.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Hey, you didn't even think about it... But you're probably right.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Right now, the Temperance Arcana
may help me grow even more...

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
Yo, what's up?

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_5_0
Come to think of it, Elizabeth asked
me to get a specific item for her...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Ooh, you're lookin' for a handheld game console?
Happy - Are you hooked on games now? Is it 'cause of the game I gave you last time, huh?
Happy - I can give you my old one if you're cool with it. Lately, I've only been using the newer, slimmer model.
No point having two of the same consoles anyways. Hold on, lemme grab it for ya.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Here ya go.
Happy - Let's play a match one day! I'll take you on anytime.

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
Happy - Woohoo! Thanks, Kirijo-senpai! Right now, I feel like I could die with no regrets!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - C'mon, go after her! Get on your knees, beg for forgiveness, and introduce her to me! Please...?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Ahaha, I tried my hand at sneaking out... but I still got caught.
Happy - Welp, guess we oughta head to our room now.
C'mon, let's hustle... or else Ms. Toriumi might get pissed at us.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Guess Kirijo-senpai's still in shock.
Sad - If I was in her shoes, I sure as heck wouldn't be in the mood to go on a trip either.

Junpei Iori
'Sup, Minato? Wanna check out the outdoor hot spring?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's go.
Maybe later.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Sweet!
Happy - I'll grab Sanada-san and Ryoji, so you can head back to the room and get ready.

Junpei Iori
Whaaat? Dude, c'mon.
Happy - Well, like it or not, you're comin' with me! Just lemme know when you're ready.

Junpei Iori
I'll grab Sanada-san and Ryoji, so you can head back to the room and get ready.

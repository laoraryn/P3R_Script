   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yo, whaddup?   
You're takin' care of the planters up top, right? Mind if I give it a try?   
Girls are into slim dudes, right? Might be good to eat some vegetables after all...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, you doin' some prep tonight for that competition tomorrow?   
Well, if you got the time, you think we can go see what's up with those planters on the roof?   
Happy - I just wanna check 'em out real quick.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The quality of the produce might improve if   
we tend to the rooftop planters together.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Wanna head up?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
All right.   
Not now.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, uh... You think we should check on those planters up there?   
I know you're not supposed to give 'em too much water, but what if they're not getting enough?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Wanna go check on the planters on the roof? It'd suck if the plants all died on us all of a sudden.   
Oh, wait, you have that competition tomorrow, huh? Well, we don't need to do it now, but...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The quality of the produce might improve if   
we tend to the rooftop planters together.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I'm not too confident doing it on my own, so if you're free, that'd be cool.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I can help.   
Not now.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, wanna head to the roof and work on those planters?   
I check on 'em once in a while, but I thought I prolly shouldn't touch 'em without you around.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Junpei seems motivated...   
The quality of the produce might improve   
if we tend to the rooftop planters together.   
Junpei might gain a new ability soon...   
   
Junpei Iori   
So how 'bout it? You're free, right?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure, let's go.   
Not now.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, if you're gonna do some gardening, I'll come too.   
It's actually a pretty good workout. I didn't think I'd get this into it.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, if you're gonna do some gardening, I'll come too. It's actually a pretty good workout.   
Happy - Might be some good training for your competition tomorrow, right?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It doesn't seem like Junpei will gain any   
more skills even if he helps me garden...   
But the quality of the produce might improve   
if we tend to the rooftop planters together.   
   
Junpei Iori   
C'mon, let's build up a sweat and release some indoor fins. Or, wait... What're they called?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure, let's go.   
Not now.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Sweet! Let's get to it.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Busy, huh? Well, if you ever feel like it, let me know.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, change your mind? Alright, let's get upstairs, then.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It doesn't seem like Junpei will gain any   
more skills even if he helps me garden...   
But the quality of the produce might improve   
if we tend to the rooftop planters together.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Can't really do it without you, dude.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The quality of the produce might improve if   
we tend to the rooftop planters together.   
   
Junpei Iori   
C'mon, it might be fun!   
   
-----   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Junpei's hard at work.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I tended the rooftop planters with Junpei...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - You're gonna be a tasty little fella. Don't stop growin', ya hear?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Not exactly huge, but what we lack in size we'll make up for in numbers!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Don't be shy, my little veggies! You can grow faster, y'know!   
   
Junpei Iori   
These little guys are pretty awesome. Lookin' at 'em makes you really think about life.   
Happy - They do make you feel better when you eat 'em. Maybe I'll take some with me next time...   
Surprised - O-Oh, uh, I was just talkin' to myself!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The extra care is paying off,   
and I can harvest more.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I'd say that's some mighty fine work! Let's head back downstairs.   
   
-----   
   
Junpei Iori   
The only vegetables I ever see at the store are plain old ordinary ones.   
   
Junpei Iori   
You know those fancy veggies only people like Kirijo-senpai would eat?   
Happy - If we could grow somethin' like that, we'd make a fortune, don't ya think?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Don't be ridiculous.   
Depends on how hard we try.   
You know what you're doing?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Haha, well, if you're already gonna do it, no harm in goin' above and beyond, right?   
Happy - You're pretty good with your hands, so whaddaya say? Wanna join forces and make a name for ourselves?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oh damn, so you're up for it? Yeah, we gotta dream big!   
Happy - You're pretty good with your hands, so whaddaya say? Wanna join forces and make a name for ourselves?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Nope, not even a little! Tried growin' some mornin' glories once—didn't think they'd die so fast!   
Happy - But you're pretty good with your hands, so I'll let you handle it. Sound good?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, we should probably get to work before we get ahead of ourselves.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I tended the rooftop planters with Junpei...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Ugh, this is gettin' really rough on my back, and my hands are all caked in dirt...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The extra care is paying off,   
and I can harvest more.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - But for the sake of Junpei's brand-name luxury veggies, I gotta keep goin'!   
Happy - I don't know how I could deal with all this on my own, so let's do this again, 'kay?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Grow up big n' strong, my precious, luxurious veggies!   
   
Junpei Iori   
But man, all this nonstop waterin' and weed-pullin', not to mention the bugs...   
Sad - It's pretty monotonous. Kinda just feels like busywork.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's all part of the fun!   
Think of it like we're training.   
Treat your garden like a lover.   
   
Junpei Iori   
You can be a weird dude sometimes, y'know? But honestly...   
The whole idea of raisin' somethin' one step at a time... It feels kinda familiar.   
Happy - Oh, yeah! It's just like levelin' up in a game. Hey, maybe this doesn't suck so bad after all.   
   
Junpei Iori   
What, you some kinda monk now? Tryin' to reach enlightenment or somethin'?   
Happy - Well, if we get to train and raise veggies, it's like killin' two birds with one stone.   
Happy - Maybe we should try catchin' flies with chopsticks like one of those master swordsmen, huh?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Like a what!? The hell does that even mean?   
But, uh... maybe you have a point.   
We gotta treat it with love and kindness. Sound about right, o wise one?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Gotta say, we've got a long way to go before these veggies put us on Easy Street.   
Happy - Anyway, I'm the one who asked you to join me in the first place, so I gotta be the one to look after 'em.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I tended the rooftop planters with Junpei...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Ta-dah da-daaah! The veggies have leveled up!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The extra care is paying off,   
and I can harvest more.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Whew, another day of hard, honest work. Let's head back downstairs.

Junpei Iori   
Happy - Heh, my thumb's gettin' a little greener every day, don't ya think?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - For an amateur vegetable patch, it's really comin' along. All that back-breakin' work was worth it!   
Happy - Listen! You hear that? That's the sound of our precious little veggies cheerin' us on.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, I think I do.   
Let's hurry up and eat them!   
...You get enough sleep?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Right? They're kinda growin' on me.   
Happy - This might actually be my callin'. Maybe I should just ride this wave and start a farm or somethin'.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Uh, we're tryin' to have a chat with 'em here. Don't let your stomach do your thinkin' for ya.   
Happy - Although, I guess it'd be rude not to gobble 'em up after all that work.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - I'm not trippin' out or whatever! What I'm tryin' to say is that they're growin' on me!   
Sad - I mean, I get it. Gardening isn't all just fun and games.   
   
Junpei Iori   
It's really cool how well they respond if you take care of 'em right.   
   
Junpei Iori   
It's one of those times where you see the fruits of your labor after lots of slow, steady work.   
Happy - I never follow through on anything, and even I pulled it off! That counts for somethin', right?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You've really grown up.   
Hope you learned your lesson.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Haha, I thought I was the one raisin' them, but maybe they were raisin' me all along.   
Very happy* - Wait... Did real, actual wisdom just come outta me? Holy crap, I grew up more than I thought!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oh, get off your high horse! These veggies raised you just as much as you raised them.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - We owe a lot to our nutritious little veggie babies. Aw, who am I kiddin'—our veggie mentors.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, whatever we do in life, we can't expect to hit a home run on the first swing.   
   
Junpei Iori   
We gotta stay on our toes and wait for the perfect chance to strike.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Scheming - And when that time comes, you knock it outta the park. That's how the real sluggers do it.   
Happy - A valuable lesson straight from our vegetable teachers. Don't go forgettin' it, ya hear?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Junpei learned new things by   
tending to the vegetable garden.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Maybe I'm finally figurin' this whole life thing out, huh?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Y'know, I think I'll write a book. I could call it somethin' like, "Life's a Vegetable Garden: The Junpei Iori Story."   
Very happy* - Sellin' books and vegetables? Oooh, we're gonna be rollin' in dough! Maaan, am I a genius or what?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Alright, enough dreamin'. Let's get a little bit more work done.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I tended the rooftop planters with Junpei...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Whew, we did a heck of a job!   
Happy - See ya later, my darlin' veggies. I'll be back again when I'm free!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Welp, let's call it a night. Hit me up again when you have some time.

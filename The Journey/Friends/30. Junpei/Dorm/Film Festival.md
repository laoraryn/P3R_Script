Happy - Nothin' weird about two guys goin' to the movies together, right? 'Cause this superhero flick's got me pumped!
Happy - C'mon, let's go! Ooh, I'm grabbin' some caramel corn!

Partner
Just picked up a robbery in progress on the police scanner! It's at a bank five blocks away, big guy!

Hero
The cops in this town are a joke. We'd better get moving, stat.

Hero
And, uh, this one of those banks where tons of hot babes hang out?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I watched American heroes save
innocent lives from evil forces.
I learned how to stand up
for freedom and justice!

Junpei Iori
Man... I should've been born in America.

Junpei Iori
Happy - By now, I would've like, saved so many chicks!
Scheming - Maybe even the whole freakin' country! And everyone'd be like, "Wow, you're the best, Junpei-Man!"

Junpei Iori
Happy - Don't ya think?

Junpei Iori
......

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - Coulda been a whole different life, man...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I went back to the dorm with Junpei.

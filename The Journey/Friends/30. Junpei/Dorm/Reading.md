Sad - Looks like there's only educational manga here. Man, I wish they had some shonen stuff...
Ah well. At least I have that one I borrowed from what's-his-name.
Happy - Yo, you wanna read it too? It's this baseball manga that finished up a while back.

Junpei Iori
Man, looks like they only got educational manga. I was hoping for some shonen stuff...
Ah well. At least I still have that one I borrowed from what's-his-name.
Happy - You wanna give it a read too? It's this baseball manga that finished up a while back.

Junpei Iori
I thought just sittin' inside and reading manga'd help me beat the heat, but...
I'm still friggin' hot! ...But this manga's pretty hot too, heh heh. Wait, not like that...
Happy - It's this cool baseball manga that... Actually, why don't you just read it yourself?

Junpei Iori
Sad - No matter how bored I get, I don't think I'll ever touch any of the books here...
Not much else to do, though... Well, there's that one manga I borrowed from what's-his-name.
You wanna read it too? It's this baseball manga that finished up a while back.

Junpei Iori
C'mon, let's read it.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure.
I'll pass.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Hey, guess what! I just borrowed some more of that manga from last time.
Happy - I got way more volumes this time. Carrying them all was a drag though...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Damn, it's hot... It'd be nice to have something to distract me from the heat, y'know?
Oh, right! The manga! I borrowed some more of it.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Nothin' to do in my room, nothin' to do out here... Pretty boring, huh?
Surprised - Oh, wait, I forgot! I borrowed more of that manga we were reading last time!

Junpei Iori

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure.
I'll pass.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Yo! I got the rest of that manga!
Happy - It's gettin' down to the final inning! We gotta finish it!

Junpei Iori
Man, this heat is killin' me. I wouldn't be surprised if all these books just burst into flames...
Oh, that reminds me, I borrowed the rest of that manga.
Happy - It's gettin' down to the final inning! We gotta finish it!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It seems like Junpei has been
looking forward to this...

Junpei might gain a new ability soon...

Junpei Iori
You up for it? If you want, I can bring 'em out now.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure.
I'll pass.

Junpei Iori
It's pretty relaxing just reading manga here, y'know?
You remember that we finished that baseball one last time, right? Well, I borrowed another one.

Junpei Iori
Dude, it's so hot, even here. But I guess complaining's not gonna make it better...
Happy - That's why I got the perfect thing to distract us from the heat! I borrowed a new manga series.

Junpei Iori
Sad - What even are these books? They don't exactly look like something someone could read for fun.
Eh, whatever. I'll just read some manga. I borrowed a different series this time.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It doesn't seem like Junpei will gain any
more skills even if we read together...
But reading manga with him could
help improve my .

Junpei Iori
You wanna get in on some of this manga action?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure.
I'll pass.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Aw yeah! That's what I like to hear!

Junpei Iori
Eh, suit yourself. This series is tight as hell, though. Just sayin'.

Junpei Iori
It's nice and quiet here, huh? I ain't like a huge reader, but this'd be the place to do it.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Junpei seems like he's having fun.
I read some manga with Junpei.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Daaang, that story really went places! Now this is a shonen manga!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The young hero's dedication
filled me with !

Junpei Iori
Well, it's gettin' late. We better get to bed.

Junpei Iori
This one's pretty old, so the art's got a retro feel to it. Guess it's s'posed to feel nostalgic, right?
The main character's got thick, seaweed eyebrows. Hey, what do you think of these old classics?

Minato Arisato - Selection
They're very tasteful.
I prefer modern art styles.
They're timeless masterpieces.

Junpei Iori
'Cause of the seaweed?
......
Surprised - 'Cause the eyebrows look like seaweed, and... And seaweed tastes good? Why're you makin' me explain it!?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Oho, I had no idea you were such a trendy fella.
Happy - The style matters, sure, but the way it inspires people never changes, y'know?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Whoa, droppin' some wisdom!
Happy - I hear ya, though. The best manga know exactly how to light a fire in your heart.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Oh crap, gotta keep goin'!
Angry - Bottom of the ninth, two outs, bases loaded, and a home run'll change it all... The hero's in a real pickle!
Happy - Hey, you'd better read faster or else I'm gonna spoil it for ya!

Junpei Iori
Sad - Damn, this is where it ends? I should've borrowed more volumes...
It gets even crazier than this if I remember right. And man, the main character's rival...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The young hero's dedication
filled me with !

Junpei Iori
Happy - I'll borrow the rest of 'em so we can pick it up next time. Well, I'm gonna hit the hay.

-----

Junpei Iori
Man, our hero took an underdog baseball team that didn't even have enough players all the way to nationals.
No matter how tough the rival or desperate the situation, the hero always ends up findin' a way.
Hey, we're technically a team too, aren't we? Means we need a hotshot of our own, right?

Minato Arisato - Selection
You're onto something.
We're all hotshots.
You read too much manga.

Junpei Iori
Haha, don't sweat it. We've already got ourselves a major hotshot—me!
Everyone else has got their own strengths, kinda like the characters in a manga.

Junpei Iori
Haha, sounds an awful lot like hero talk to me. Share some of that glory, why don't ya?
Hotshot or not, the others've got so much personality, kinda like the characters in a manga.

Junpei Iori
Oh yeah? That not realistic enough for ya?
But don't ya think Sanada-san and Kirijo-senpai have way more personality than any manga character?

Junpei Iori
Either way, kinda blows that real life can't be like how it is in a manga.
Anywho, on to the next page.

Junpei Iori
Oh yeah, that's right. Just before the big game, the hero collapses!
All after gettin' everyone together, trainin' like crazy, becomin' a hotshot hitter, and carryin' the whole team all by himself.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The young hero's dedication
filled me with !

Junpei Iori
Dyin' to know what happens next, huh? Then I'll borrow the rest of the volumes from my buddy, pronto!

Junpei Iori
So in the last volume, we left off just as the hero passed out from pushin' himself too hard.
That part where his teammates manage to keep an even score while he's out was such a tear-jerker!
Happy - The game's almost over, and our hero—still weak after a short rest—steps up to bat...

Minato Arisato - Selection
It's getting exciting!
It's pretty cliché.
What happens next?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Hey, you totally get it! I honestly thought you wouldn't be into it so much.
Happy - It's predictable, but it doesn't stop it from being awesome! Man I forgot how good stories like these are.

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - Well sure, but... you gotta just enjoy it for what it is, y'know?
Happy - It's predictable, but it doesn't stop it from being awesome! Man I forgot how good stories like these are.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Well read it and find out! Unless you want me to just spoil it all for ya.
Scheming - I know it's only a manga, but it's been a long time since I've been this pumped up!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Alright, now that we're at the best part, let's go full speed 'til the end!

Junpei Iori
Whew... What a ride.

Junpei Iori
Happy - The hero totally kicks everyone's asses in the end. And that part where he's so exhausted that he, like, surges with power...
Happy - It's like his senses heightened to a whole 'nother level. Wouldn't it be so freakin' cool if we could do that?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Why don't you give it a shot?
That only happens in manga.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Think so? It's gonna be intense, y'know. It's what separates the chumps from the masters.

Junpei Iori
No way, man! I think it's worth a shot! It's what separates the chumps from the masters!

Junpei Iori
You can't just rely on raw strength. You gotta concentrate, let go of all that tension...
Happy - Then gzzzzt! Your power's all like womwomwom, and you unleash it like pchooooo!

Junpei Iori
Or maybe you power up like HNNNGH, then let 'er rip—FYOOO, PCHOOOOO! That make sense?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Junpei picked up some combat tips
from the hero of the baseball manga.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Dude, I think I might actually be able to pull this off. I gotta look into this more.
Happy - Wanna read it one more time? Just the last part, I mean.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The young hero's dedication
filled me with !

Junpei Iori
And that, my friend, wraps up the series.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Reading alone's fine, but with gems like this one, it's better to share the fun with a pal.
Happy - I'll bring you somethin' else next time. We should do this again when you're free.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Let's call it a night, shall we? Man, I'm gonna sleep like a log.

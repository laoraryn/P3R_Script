Why do you have these flowers?

Minato Arisato - Selection
You should give them to her.
Did I cross a line?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Wha—

Surprised - ......

Junpei Iori
Angry - What the heck, dude! What's your deal!?
Angry - Or is this like, a crush thing!? 'Cause this is too much love to handle!

Minato Arisato - Selection
Well, I don't hate you.
No, not exactly.
You're acting like a baby.

Junpei Iori
Angry - Yeah, yeah, I know! That's why you always have my back...

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Don't bother denyin' it! And if it weren't true, it'd be even weirder!

Junpei Iori
Sad - Whoa, uncalled for! Am I not allowed be in a bad mood!?

Junpei Iori
Sad - Ahh, dammit! You really backed me into a corner here.
Sad - I can't just not go now after all this!

Junpei Iori
But... Well, thanks.
Guess I should take a page outta your book and finesse my way in.

Junpei Iori
Happy - 'Cept these flowers don't really make me look cool at all.
Happy - Maybe I should come burstin' in with a whole bouquet.

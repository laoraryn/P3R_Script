Junpei Iori
Happy - Oh, Minato! Perfect timing!
Happy - You see my message? The one about my great idea?
I was thinkin' of carryin' it out.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I spend the day with Junpei?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Spend time with Junpei
Not now

Junpei Iori
Happy - Hell yeah, you know what's up!
Okay, then I'm gonna go buy the thing we need.
Happy - Just wait here for me!

Junpei Iori
Sad - Seriously?
Man... I guess we can do it some other time, then.

-----

Junpei Iori
Happy - That's one magnificent melon, ain't she? It's the highlight of my day!
Happy - Sooo, I've been thinkin' of throwin' a watermelon-splitting party.

Junpei Iori
We haven't really done anything summery since vacation started, y'know?
'Specially Amada. He always looks so bored when I see him in the dorm.
Exasperated* - And man, that kills me to see.
Exasperated* - It'd be a real shame if he didn't have a single entry in his summer picture diary.

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's so thoughtful of you.
You feel bad for him?
What are you really getting at?

Junpei Iori
Scheming - Heh, I can already see the look on his face!
Happy - He'll be like, "Junpei-san, you're super cool AND you're super nice!"

Junpei Iori
Scheming - It's just one of those things you either pick up on or you don't.
Scheming - Amada's eyes tell it all, at least to me. That lonely stare...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Honest to god, I just want the kid to have a fun summer.
Happy - Look into my eyes—would they lie to you?

Junpei Iori
Oh, I mean, don't you know?

Junpei Iori
Scheming - They say women can't resist a guy with a soft spot for kids.

Junpei Iori
Happy - And you know what that means—I'm gonna need your help!
It's a win-win situation, don't ya think? Anywho... Oh boy...

Junpei Iori
Surprised - I think my arms are gonna fall off...

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
Ah yes, today's shaping up to be a glorious day.
Sad - It's such a shame that the third-years and the ladies won't be joining us.

Ken Amada
Sad - Um, if we're splitting watermelons, I'm out.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Wha— Just like that!? You're not even gonna hear me out!?

Ken Amada
Sad - You have a watermelon and a bat. What else could it possibly be?
Sad - It's more for little kids anyway, plus it's really hot out. And look, I get you're trying to be nice...

Minato Arisato - Selection
You should join us.
Come on, we're bored.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Yeah, for real! Without you, it'd just be me and Minato, y'know?
Happy - And isn't that just the saddest thing you ever heard?

Ken Amada
Happy - Well, when you put it that way... I guess I don't have a choice.

Junpei Iori
Scheming - Hey, don't make it sound like we have nothing better to do.
Happy - Eh, but I guess we really don't, huh? C'mon, let's have some fun!

Ken Amada
Happy - Well, when you put it that way... Maybe just for a little bit.

Koromaru
Happy - Arf! Arf!

Junpei Iori
Happy - I know, Koromaru. Don't you worry, boy. We didn't forget about ya!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Alright, what're we waitin' for? The youngest gets to draw first blood!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Now this is what real summer feels like! My blood's pumpin' somethin' fierce!

Ken Amada
Happy - Look who's acting like a kid now... Heheh.

Ken Amada
Happy - Oh yeah, where's the blindfold? We can't split watermelons with just a bat.
Surprised - Speaking of... This bat seems kind of worn in, doesn't it?

Junpei Iori
Oh wow, you caught that. That bat and I go way back.
Had it since I was in little league. I've never mentioned this before?

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's news to me.
That sounds familiar.

Junpei Iori
Ah, musta never had a chance to talk about it. That I used to play baseball, I mean.
Exasperated* - Anyway, that's old news now.

Junpei Iori
Oh yeah? Well, it's not some big secret or anything.
I used to play tons of baseball back in the day. But that's old news now.

Ken Amada
Sad - Wait, then should we really be hitting watermelons with this?

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - Hm? Ah, well...
Nah, it's cool. Don't think I'll be usin' it much from here on out.

Koromaru
Sad - *whine*

Junpei Iori
Happy - What's wrong, bud? Dyin' to chomp on some melon?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Koromaru's trying to tell us something.

Koromaru
Woof!

Junpei Iori
Sad - Hey, c'mon, Koromaru. We can't swing at the watermelon with you in the way.

Ken Amada
Koromaru...?

Ken Amada
Happy - Hey, why don't we use something other than the bat?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Good idea.
What do you want to use?

Ken Amada
Happy - See? Arisato-san thinks so, too!

Junpei Iori
Then what else are we gonna use?

Ken Amada
Surprised - Um, anything, I guess! Just as long as it's interesting!

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - Interesting? Kind of a weird request... Oh, like if Sanada-san used his bare hands?

Akihiko Sanada
Someone say my name?

Ken Amada
Surprised - Whoa, Sanada-san!

Akihiko Sanada
Well, when I got back, I thought I heard voices coming from the roof, so I came to check it out. Watermelon splittin', huh?

Ken Amada
Happy - Th-That's right! We were just talking about what to use to hit it!

Akihiko Sanada
You're not gonna use that bat?

Minato Arisato - Selection
We want to use something else.
We want you to use your fists.

Ken Amada
Happy - Yeah! We were just saying you could probably do it with your bare hands!

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - That is tempting, considering how huge it is. Are you sure it's okay?

Akihiko Sanada
My fists? On this?

Ken Amada
Happy - Oh my god, yes! I'd actually love to see that!

Ken Amada
Happy - That's okay, right, Junpei-san?

Junpei Iori
Huh? Uh, sure, if that's what you want.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - All right. Guess I better make this good, then.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Hey, try not to go all out or there won't be any left to eat.

Akihiko Sanada
Very angry* - Hyah!

Ken Amada
Happy - Whooooa! Sanada-san, you're incredible!

Koromaru
Happy - Arf! Arf!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - What the heck! How are we supposed to eat it now!?

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - Can't believe that thing was still edible after it exploded like that.
Exasperated* - Didn't go exactly how I was expectin', but it looked like Amada had fun.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Ahhh, and man, I was actin' kinda lame back there, huh?
Sad - Y'know, before we busted the melon.

Junpei Iori
Sad - I'm talkin' about the whole bat thing. You were just tryin' to be thoughtful.

Junpei Iori
Sad - I didn't wanna come off like I was havin' second thoughts, but I guess I couldn't help it, huh?

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - I was supposed to be this cool mentor, but instead the kid ends up pitying me.

Minato Arisato - Selection
You did the best you could.
It's still a start.
You have great qualities.

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - Haha, don't worry about me anymore. I'll just get even sadder, y'know?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - I mean, I'm not sayin' it's your fault, Minato.
Sad - Ah, how the hell do I put it...? This is a me problem. It probably doesn't make sense.

Junpei Iori
Sad - I feel like my life, my teenage years...
Exasperated* - It's just all over the place.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Anyway, I think we're done for today, yeah?
Happy - Appreciate you helpin' me prep and clean up. Welp, let's head back downstairs.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I feel like my  has improved
after seeing how considerate Junpei is...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Oh, Arisato-kun. We were just talking about you.
Let me introduce you to Amada-kun.

Ken Amada
Happy - Nice to meet you. My name is Ken Amada.
Happy - I attend Gekkoukan Elementary School.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Nice to meet you too.
You're very polite.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Be friends with him, alright? He's a good kid.

Ken Amada
Really? I think it's pretty normal to greet someone new like that...

Junpei Iori
Elementary school kids these days seem more grown up, huh?

Yukari Takeba
Amada-kun drops by the shrine pretty often.
It's close to our dorm, you know. So if you ever see him, say hello, okay, Arisato-kun?

Ken Amada
Happy - Yukari-san and Junpei-san often help me out.
Happy - Especially Yukari-san! Her advice is very useful.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I don't say anything that special, though.
Happy - Amada-kun is surprisingly reliable. And he's so much more mature than Stupei.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Hey, you can come to me for advice too, y'know?
Happy - All your problems and concerns will be solved, 100% satisfaction guaranteed!

Ken Amada
Um, okay... I'll think about it.

Ken Amada
Oh, hello Arisato-san.

Yukari Takeba
I've been chatting with Amada-kun today, and boy, he really is mature, you know?
He definitely acts a lot more adult than Junpei.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Geez, Yuka-tan, that's mean! How 'bout you? You think I'm totally the more mature one, right?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, I agree.
Amada's more mature.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Booyah! You hear that, Yuka-tan? Guess I was right and you were wrong! Ha!

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Aaaand case in point...

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Wait, you too!? C'mon, man, that's messed up, ganging up on me like that...

Ken Amada
Happy - Well, to me, Junpei-san is like a grown-up, too.
He's really tall, and he has a lot of interesting things to say.

Junpei Iori
Happy - See!? Even Amada says so!
I guess it takes a certain "maturity" to realize it.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Oh, c'mon! You're basically just making him pity you... Sorry about that, Amada-kun.

Yukari Takeba
Oh, Arisato-kun.
Amada-kun was just telling us about the elementary school dorm.

Ken Amada
Speaking of which, Arisato-san lives in the school dorms too, doesn't he?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Yep, that's right.
He lives in the same dorm as me, Yuka-tan, and the others.

Ken Amada
Surprised - What? It's okay for boys and girls to stay in the same dorm?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Um, actually, it's usually not... But our dorm has some special circumstances.

Junpei Iori
Happy - We're just cool like that. Right, Minato?

Junpei Iori
What're the rules like at the elementary school dorm?
Is it less strict, since it's all kids?

Ken Amada
Hmm... It's normal.
We have to put away whatever we take out, and we need permission to take food from the fridge.
Pretty much stuff that's just common sense.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Oh... That sounds more strict than I thought...

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - ...Junpei, why don't you go live at the elementary school dorm and learn some discipline?

Ken Amada
Hello, Arisato-san.
You all come to the shrine quite often, huh? Well, me too, I guess...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Why do you come here?
Do you have friends your age?

Ken Amada
No specific reason... I just feel like I can relax here.

Junpei Iori
Still, it's kind of a weird place for a kid to relax. Are you sure you're in elementary school?

Ken Amada
Yeah, I do play with my friends sometimes, but I just wasn't in the mood today.

Yukari Takeba
I know the feeling. Sometimes, it's nice to just relax in silence, you know?

Ken Amada
I have to leave soon, though, since I left in the middle of doing my homework to come here.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Come to think of it, this is where we first met Amada, huh?

Ken Amada
Happy - That's right. Junpei-san was the first one who came up to talk to me.
Happy - Then Yukari-san started coming too and offered to help me out with some stuff.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - You know Junpei. He'd get chummy with just about anyone.
Happy - I was just worried that he might be bothering Amada-kun.

Junpei Iori
Sad - You don't gotta put it like that, Yuka-tan...
I mean, anyone would reach out to someone if they looked lonely, right?

===============================================================================================

Ken Amada
Surprised - Um... Today's the last day of summer vacation, right?
Well, since it is...
...I was wondering if you had any plans today.
Sad - I-I just wanted to ask. No reason...
Sad - ......

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It seems like Amada wants
to say something...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I invite him to the film festival?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Invite him to the movies
Remain silent

Ken Amada
Happy - S-Sure!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Amada looks happy...

Ken Amada
I always thought there was something I had to do.
But I could never really figure out what it was...
Sad - But I've made up my mind... The next chance I get, I'll do it.
Sad - My mind is clear.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Amada has a serious expression...
I doubt he's in the mood
to go to the movies...

Ken Amada
Now that I'm a part of the team, I see you all differently.
Happy - ...I'll do my best, as a member of SEES.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Amada has a serious expression...
I doubt he's in the mood
to go to the movies...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Right now, the Temperance Arcana
may help me grow even more...

===============================================================================================

Ken Amada
Oh, hello, Arisato-san.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Come to think of it, Elizabeth asked
me to get a specific item for her...

Ken Amada
Surprised - What...? A Featherman R doll?
Surprised - Isn't that the prize you can win in a raffle? You enter by buying packs of Gummy Gum.
Surprised - Why would you want one? You're already in high school...
Surprised - Well, I do have one...

Ken Amada
Sad - I-I'm not into it or anything! I just happen to have extra raffle tickets.
Sad - Um... I actually have a dupe of the same color, so you can have it.
But... please take good care of it.
But, wow... I didn't know you liked Phoenix Ranger Featherman R.
M-Maybe we could watch it together sometime...?

===============================================================================================

Ken Amada
Oh, hello, Arisato-san.
Happy - Please allow me to reintroduce myself. My name is Ken Amada. That's "Ken," written with the character for "dry."
Happy - I just moved into the dorm. I'll be staying here for the summer.

Ken Amada
Aigis-san is a robot, right?
You really can't tell whenever she wears normal clothes like we do.
The Kirijo Group must be super powerful to have invented a robot like her.

Ken Amada
Happy - Sanada-san, you always wear those gloves when you fight, right?
Happy - I hear that, once you put them on, you're undefeatable.

Akihiko Sanada
Yeah...
It's no big deal, really...

Ken Amada
You all stay up so late.
I try to stay up as late as you guys, but I'm always the first one to fall asleep.
What do you guys do so late at night?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Study.
Goof off.
Adult activities.

Ken Amada
Sad - Wow... High school must be really hard.

Ken Amada
Is that allowed?
If you stay up late goofing off, you're going to fall asleep during class.

Ken Amada
Sad - There you go, treating me like a kid again...
Sad - You're not that much older than me, you know.

Ken Amada
Happy - You won't grow any taller if you stay up late, you know?
Sad - Then again... all of you are really tall, so maybe that doesn't bother you.

Ken Amada
I think coffee is best taken black...
Don't you agree, Arisato-san? Or do you drink it another way?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I drink it black.
I add milk and sugar.
I prefer Wiener Melanges.

Ken Amada
Happy - I thought you would.
Happy - Only children would add milk and sugar to coffee.

Ken Amada
Surprised - Huh? Really? Hm... I guess that doesn't taste so bad either.

Ken Amada
Surprised - Huh? Wiener what?
Surprised - You mean... like the sausage?
Happy - Oh, you're just teasing me. I mean, there's no way anyone would put sausages in their coffee... Right?

Ken Amada
I saw something on TV about people with Apathy Syndrome...
Apparently, everyone was cured all at the same time. That's a little strange, isn't it?
I mean, there's no way everyone can recover at the exact same time.
So how...?

Ken Amada
Oh, right. This is Koromaru's new home, isn't it?
Happy - It's gonna be a lot of fun with him around.

Ken Amada
Aren't you going to the festival, Arisato-san?
I'm not interested in going though. Is that weird?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, it's pretty weird.
Isn't that normal?

Ken Amada
Yeah, I know. "What kind of kid doesn't want to go to a festival," right? Everyone says so.
But I don't care what they think. I just don't like festivals.

Ken Amada
Surprised - Huh...?
Oh, sorry. I was just a little surprised. Lots of people tell me it is weird.
But you're different, Arisato-san...

Ken Amada
Mitsuru-san took Aigis-san to the summer festival...
I didn't hear anything on the news about it, so no one must have noticed that she's a robot.
She must've been in stealth mode...

Ken Amada
I never realized how expensive clothes are...
Yukari-san left one of her magazines out, so I got curious and flipped through it.
Some clothes look the same, but their price tags are totally different. Hm... Trendsetters sure have it hard, don't they?

Ken Amada
Sad - I always thought there was something I had to do.
Sad - The more I thought about it, the more hesitant I became...
Sad - But I've made up my mind... The next chance I get, I'll do it.
...I'll get it done for sure.

Ken Amada
Happy - I will be joining SEES as of today.
Happy - I promise to do my best.

Ken Amada
Just wondering, does everyone do any weapon training?
Sad - I should practice on my own to get the hang of fighting better, shouldn't I?
Sad - Okay, I'll start today then.

Ken Amada
Sad - Now that I've officially joined and learned what's really going on...
Sad - It's changed my perspective. This is a job only we can do.

Ken Amada
School starts up again tomorrow...
Has Junpei-san caught up on his homework? Doesn't he seem to be spacing out more often?
Happy - Oh, my homework's all done, of course.
Happy - I knocked it all out in July. That's just par for the course.

Ken Amada
When Aigis-san wears a school uniform, she looks just like your average high school student.

Ken Amada
Aragaki-san seems very strong.
But do you think he's trustworthy? I mean, he was hanging out at that kind of place...
Sad - I just find it hard to trust people like him right off the bat...

Ken Amada
Did something happen between Yukari-san, Junpei-san, and Aragaki-san?
They all seem to trust each other...
Sad - I guess the two of them think Aragaki-san is a good person.

Ken Amada
There's finally going to be a full moon tomorrow...
I'm not scared, but I guess I'm a little nervous.
Happy - I'll try my best not to get in anyone's way.

Ken Amada
Mitsuru-san and Sanada-san are both still at the hospital.
Their questioning of Chidori must not be going well...

Ken Amada
Why isn't anyone going to the hospital today?
Did they finish questioning her already? Chidori, right?

Ken Amada
Koromaru always seems to be having fun, doesn't he?
He gets so excited over a meal or a walk...
Sad - I wish my life was that simple.

Ken Amada
It's almost time for the culture festival at your school, right?
I hear we might be hit by a typhoon though...
But if the festival doesn't get canceled, I hope you have fun.

Ken Amada
Oh, Arisato-san. Are you feeling better? How's the cold?
Since school's out anyway, you should just rest for today.

Ken Amada
That was a pretty big typhoon. I bet a lot of buildings were destroyed.
Yukari-san and Fuuka-san were really scared...
Were you scared during the typhoon, too, Arisato-san?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, a little.
No, not at all.
I slept through it.

Ken Amada
...I was a little scared too.

Ken Amada
Surprised - Y-Yeah, who'd be scared of a little typhoon, right?

Ken Amada
Oh, that's right...

Ken Amada
Anyway, I'm glad this dorm came out unscathed. It kept creaking for two days straight...

Ken Amada
I think I'll head to my room in a bit...
Oh, don't mind me. I'm usually like this.
Sad - ......

Ken Amada
Our next operation will be on October 4th...
Let's do our best.

Ken Amada
It's about time for a full moon... Are you ready?

Minato Arisato - Selection
You bet.
Kinda.

Ken Amada
I hope we'll be able to win again this time.

Ken Amada
Well, there's still plenty of time to prepare yourself, so no need to panic.

Ken Amada
I'm ready... Let's put our best foot forward.

Ken Amada
Sad - I'm really sorry about what happened...
Sad - You could've told me no, but you let me come back...
Sad - I'll make it up to everyone... To Aragaki-san, too...

Ken Amada
Sad - I said my prayers, so I'll be okay.
Sad - Grieving over a death and just feeling down are two completely different emotions...
Sad - So, yeah... I'm okay...

Ken Amada
Aigis-san will be taking exams for the first time.
How do you think she'll do, Arisato-san?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Remarkably.
Normal, I guess.
About the same as Junpei.

Ken Amada
Happy - Yeah, I think so, too. She is a robot, after all.
Happy - If her processors work at full capacity, then she could crank out answers at record-breaking speeds. It'd be legendary!

Ken Amada
That's a possibility. People may get suspicious if she scores too well.

Ken Amada
Surprised - R-Really...? Would that even be possible?

Ken Amada
Sad - To be honest, I was planning to go to that spot today...
...But then I decided not to.
If I keep living in the past, I'll never be able to move forward.

Ken Amada
We don't have exams in elementary school, but I'll have to take them in middle school...
Are they difficult?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yes, they are.
Not really.
They're pure torture.

Ken Amada
Sad - Well, that's depressing...

Ken Amada
Happy - Really? Wow, that's good to hear...

Ken Amada
Surprised - Oh, they must be... Junpei-san always looks like he had the life sucked out of him afterwards.
Sad - But the same thing won't happen to me if I review what I've learned, right?

Ken Amada
Classes, clubs, and exams... High school life sounds brutal.

Ken Amada
Aigis-san said she didn't do so well on her exams...
Maybe some academic specs had to be sacrificed to make her overspecialized in combat...
Hm... I guess robots have their own share of problems, too, huh?

Ken Amada
What am I gonna do after the Dark Hour disappears? Hm... I don't know.
I'll be sure to tell my mother and Aragaki-san about it, but...
I guess I wanna learn what it's like to be an ordinary elementary school student.

Ken Amada
I received a compliment from Ikutsuki-san the other day.
He told me I was doing well for an elementary school student.
Happy - That made me really happy.

Ken Amada
This may sound like a strange question, but I just have to know.
Am I being helpful?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Of course.
I guess so.

Ken Amada
Happy - I'm glad to hear that...
Happy - I want my mom and Aragaki-san to be proud of me.

Ken Amada
I see... Looks like I need to work harder.
I want my mom and Aragaki-san to be proud of me...

Ken Amada
I'll keep doing my very best up to the end. I mean, that's all I can do right now...
Happy - More importantly, I want to be able to tell my mom and Aragaki-san that I did everything I could.

Ken Amada
No matter how much you prepare for something, doing it for real is always a little nerve-racking, isn't it?
How about you, Arisato-san? Do you feel nervous in the slightest?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'm pretty nervous.
I'm fine.

Ken Amada
Happy - I guess even you feel the pressure, Arisato-san...
I feel the same way. When I think about the Dark Hour disappearing...

Ken Amada
Surprised - You're amazing... No wonder you're the leader.
I can't help but feel uneasy whenever I think about the Dark Hour disappearing...

Ken Amada
Strega might be planning something.
But that doesn't matter...
Angry - Because I'll never forgive them for what they did...

Ken Amada
This is it...
I'm going to fight for my mom... and Aragaki-san.

Ken Amada
What in the world was Ikutsuki-san plotting? He went on about "resurrection" and "sacrifices"...
Sad - But he kicked the bucket before explaining the most important part.
Sad - I never thought he would be such an irresponsible adult.

Ken Amada
Sad - I wonder if Mitsuru-san's okay...
She can't seem to rely on any adults.
I suppose adults are... less reliable than I thought.

Ken Amada
Sad - I lost a parent, so I know how Mitsuru-san feels.
Sad - I don't really know how I got back on my feet, but...
Sad - I still remember how I shut myself away from the rest of the world.
Sad - ......

Ken Amada
Junpei-san usually looks over the moon when he comes back from visiting Chidori-san, but...
Sad - Recently, he seems kind of down...
Do you think something happened between them?

Ken Amada
The school trip, huh...
Unfortunately, I can't tag along, so I'll hold the fort. Would you bring me back a souvenir?
Happy - ...Um, preferably something other than a T-shirt or a keychain.
Happy - I hear they have really good nama-yatsuhashi there.

Ken Amada
Sad - Mitsuru-san and Sanada-san have been the ones taking charge this whole time...
Sad - But now even they don't know what to do.
Sad - What's going to happen to us...?

Koromaru
Arf! Arf!

Ken Amada
Happy - Haha, are you telling me not to worry, Koromaru? You're such a brave dog.

Ken Amada
By the way...
You guys look a bit uncomfortable around the girls...
Did something happen on the school trip?

Ken Amada
By the way...
I noticed that the girls look, um... pretty mad with you guys.
Well, not that I can't put two and two together...

Ken Amada
Sad - Oh... You didn't bring any souvenirs...

Ken Amada
Surprised - Huh? You really got me a souvenir!?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
What should I give him...?

Ken Amada
Happy - Wow, konpeito! I love konpeito!
Happy - Thank you for the candy!

Ken Amada
Crackers...?
I-I thought only old people liked crackers...

Ken Amada
Hmm? Are these... pickled vegetables?
Sad - I... see...

Ken Amada
Ooh, nama-yatsuhashi?
Happy - Yay! It's got azuki, too!
Happy - Nama-yatsuhashi with azuki is the best!
Happy - Hehe, thank you!

Ken Amada
Career experience week sounds like fun...
Do you think it's a hassle, too, Arisato-san?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, kind of.
I'm looking forward to it.

Ken Amada
I see. That's a bit disappointing...

Ken Amada
Really? I wish I could join you. I'd like to try working a job, too...

Ken Amada
Happy - Personally, I would want to work at Chagall.
Oh, but Wilduck's hard to pass up, too... Maybe you could get free burgers.

Ken Amada
Sad - I wonder what Strega is...
Sad - Maybe there's a mastermind who planted the idea in their heads...
Sad - What on earth were they thinking?
Sad - Couldn't they foresee this happening?

Ken Amada
Oh, Arisato-san. How did career experience go?

Minato Arisato - Selection
It was fun.
It was boring.

Ken Amada
Oh, that's great. Maybe Junpei-san would've had a good time if he went...
Sad - ...But I guess that's not happening.

Ken Amada
Surprised - Oh... Then maybe it's a good thing Junpei-san didn't go.
Sad - I hope he feels better soon.

Ken Amada
Sad - Do you think Junpei-san is doing okay? I just hope he gets back on his feet soon.

Ken Amada
Happy - She drew a picture of him in her sketchbook, huh... That sounds like a scene in a romance novel.
Happy - Anyway, I'm glad that Junpei-san is himself again.

Ken Amada
Does Aigis-san not get along with Ryoji-san very well?
He's a strange guy, but I think he's plenty polite and interesting.

Ken Amada
There's going to be a full moon soon, isn't there?
I know there's not much else we can do, but I can't help but feel a bit restless...
I guess I'll just have to deal with it.

Ken Amada
Sad - Sorry... I don't feel like talking right now...

Ken Amada
I was hoping this was all just a bad dream...
Sad - I remember the other time I wished everything was a dream...
Sad - ......

Ken Amada
...Can't we do anything? Anything at all? This is just so difficult.
Sad - ......
Sad - Sorry, I shouldn't expect you to have an answer ready for everything...

Ken Amada
Sad - Everyone at school is just going about their day as if nothing's wrong...
Sad - They think everything's normal... Must be nice.
Sad - Is that what being happy is like?
Sad - Ignorance is bliss, I guess...

Ken Amada
Koromaru is always so calm and collected. Dogged, really...
He was at that shrine all by himself.
I want to be more like Koromaru... I don't want to be stuck in the past anymore.
Aragaki-san kept me alive for a reason...

Ken Amada
Sad - It'll be hard to go back to the way things were.
Sad - No matter what I do, I find myself going in circles...

Ken Amada
Happy - It's pretty rare for you to be here, Mitsuru-san...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hm? Is it now?
Well, I suppose it's true I've never laughed like this with all of you before...
Happy - It's a pleasant change of pace. I'll join you again if the opportunity presents itself.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - We'll be happy to have you anytime. Right, Fuuka?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Of course! Let's do this again.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Well... M-Maybe I will...

Ken Amada
Oh, Arisato-san. How did you do on your finals?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Good.
Okay.
Pretty bad.

Ken Amada
Surprised - Wow, impressive.
Happy - I can't believe you're scoring top marks despite everything going on. That's our leader for you.

Ken Amada
Happy - I mean, considering the circumstances we're in, I think you did the best you could.

Ken Amada
Well, I think you should give yourself a pass.
You did what you could while in a hard situation, so please don't be too hard on yourself.

Ken Amada
It's almost Christmas, isn't it?
It's like I was sleepwalking...
With so much going on, I almost forgot all about Christmas...

Ken Amada
Apparently, more couples are out and about as it gets closer to Christmas day.
Are you spending Christmas with someone special, Arisato-san?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Of course.
That's a secret.
No.

Ken Amada
Wow... You sound like an adult...

Ken Amada
Surprised - Oh, come on... Now I'm really curious.

Ken Amada
Oh, I see...
Well, it's not too late for you to find someone... That feels kinda wrong though.

Ken Amada
It's comforting, knowing that there's someone watching over me...
...So I can't give up.
I'll do whatever it takes to get as far as I can.

Ken Amada
I wonder why people are so desperate to spend this day with their partners...
Christmas can still be fun, even if you're alone...

Ken Amada
Christmas was pretty short.
I bet regular people dance their way into the new year as well, but we're...

Ken Amada
The kids in my class are all excited for winter break.
But none of them realize what's going to happen...
Sad - They don't know what kind of decision we have to make...

Ken Amada
My schoolmates are probably all enjoying their vacation.
They're probably sitting by the fire, drinking hot chocolate...
*sigh* I wish we could do that.

Ken Amada
How mysterious...
Happy - She used to be so formal.
Happy - But now Aigis-san is no different from the rest of us.

Ken Amada
It's okay. I'm sure of my answer.

Ken Amada
I wasn't able to ask before, but...
Is it really true that all girls go "commando" when they wear a kimono?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yes, it's true.
No, that's a lie.
That's a mystery.

Ken Amada
Huh... It's not very smart not to wear underwear in the winter.

Ken Amada
Happy - So Junpei-san was lying... I knew the girls wouldn't go outside without wearing underwear.
Happy - It's the beginning of the new year, and Junpei-san has already started acting childish.

Ken Amada
Surprised - A mystery...? Is it really that big of a secret?

Ken Amada
I saw a news report about that cult. They've become so big so quickly.
That's one way to start the new year on the wrong foot, huh? And there's only a month left...

Ken Amada
The cult has this mantra: "If you believe, you will be saved."
But does anyone actually think that's true?
It kind of reminds me of those ads at the back of a magazine...
You know, the ones that say, "Buy this product and you'll be happier!"

Ken Amada
The cult is a hot topic among my classmates... even though we're only elementary students.
But at least they're just talking about it and not actually followers.
I heard that some middle and high school students have joined though...

Ken Amada
There are still so many things I want to do in life.
Angry - I don't want to die before I can become an adult.
I plan to do everything I can to make sure that doesn't ever happen.

Ken Amada
I think the magazines that interviewed Strega are ridiculous.
They're so insensitive... Do they think that they can just write whatever they want as long as it sells?

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's not true.
That's capitalism.
I don't know.

Ken Amada
I guess... Maybe some of them have a sense of ethics.

Ken Amada
Sad - That's true... but it still doesn't make it right.

Ken Amada
Yeah, it's tough... I wonder if I'll still worry about this kind of stuff when I'm an adult.

Ken Amada
Sad - I know they're just doing their job, but they shouldn't treat Strega like celebrities. That's irresponsible.

Ken Amada
I was thinking about what Strega said, about the Fall being salvation...
Didn't someone else say something similar?

Minato Arisato - Selection
You mean Ikutsuki?
You mean Ryoji?
Who do you mean?

Ken Amada
Sad - Ah, yeah, I remember Ikutsuki-san talking about salvation and the Fall.
Sad - Do you think it was just a coincidence?

Ken Amada
Hm... No, I don't think it was Ryoji-san.

Ken Amada
It was... Oh, that's right—Ikutsuki-san. He also talked about salvation and the Fall.
Seems like more than just a coincidence to me.

Ken Amada
Surprised - I've always thought that taking college entrance exams was just a one and done deal.
But after you take the National Center Test for University Admissions, there's a secondary exam for each college you apply to...
It's like there's no end to the tests... Mitsuru-san and the other third-years are amazing.

Ken Amada
Sad - The Dark Hour has taken so many things away from me.
Happy - But you guys have given me the greatest gift of all—friendship.
Happy - So, I won't give up... I'll make sure the Dark Hour disappears.

Junpei Iori
Happy - You said it, little dude! I'm counting on you!

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Yeah, don't ever let go of that resolve.

Ken Amada
Didn't Koromaru lose his owner because of the Shadows?
It's easy to forget because he's always so full of energy, but...
This battle must mean a lot to him.

Ken Amada
Junpei-san...

Ken Amada
I saw a TV show the other day that said the family environment influences your career choice.
Whether someone grows up in a strict household or a lenient one...
All of that affects how a person relates to others.
It's kind of complicated, huh?

Ken Amada
Did you have your career consultation, Arisato-san?
It's important to give these things some consideration, especially now, isn't it?
If you have something you want to do for your future, then you have a reason to defeat Nyx, right?

Minato Arisato - Selection
You're right.
Not really.

Ken Amada
I haven't really thought about my future because I'm so young...
But I think this is as good an opportunity as any for me to start...

Ken Amada
Oh, I see...
Well, I guess the future's different for everyone... It's a little beyond me right now though.

Ken Amada
Just between you and me, I think black coffee is really bitter.
I was told that when I grow up, I'll acquire a taste for it.
I wonder if that day will really come.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Of course.
I don't know.

Ken Amada
Thank you. Sorry, I was just a little scared...
Happy - Let's do our best, Arisato-san.

Ken Amada
You're right. No one knows about the future.
Happy - Anyway, let's do our best. That's all we can do, after all.

Ken Amada
Let's give it all we've got, Arisato-san. I'm sure we can win this.

Ken Amada
Oh, hello, Arisato-san...
Happy - I'm taking Koromaru for a walk while I can since I don't think there'll be time tonight.

Koromaru
Happy - Arf, arf!

Ken Amada
We have to put an end to the Dark Hour... for my mother, Aragaki-san, and myself.
I will fight with all I've got. Not for revenge, but so we can live.

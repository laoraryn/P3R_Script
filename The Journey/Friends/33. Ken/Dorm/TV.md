Ken Amada
I just rented a DVD. It's a foreign film about a hardboiled detective.
I have a little free time right now, so...

Ken Amada
Oh, Arisato-san.
Um, I rented a DVD. It's a foreign film about a hardboiled detective.
I've got a lot of free time on days we don't go to Tartarus, so...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Watching a detective movie with Amada
might help me gain more ...

Ken Amada
If you're free right now, do you want to watch it with me?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's watch it together.
Now's a bad time.

Ken Amada
Do you want to watch more of the film series we started together?
I just rented another movie from the same series because I wanted to watch it sometime...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Watching a detective movie with Amada
might help me gain more ...

Ken Amada
The reviews online all seemed pretty positive, so I'm sure it's worth watching.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's watch it together.
Now's a bad time.

Ken Amada
I rented the final movie from that series.
Happy - I'm certain it'll be a good watch, too.

Ken Amada
Junpei-san and Chidori-san's relationship kinda feels like a movie plot, huh?
Oh, by the way... I rented the final movie from that series.
Happy - I'm certain it'll be a good watch, too.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It seems like Amada is looking
forward to hanging out.
Watching a detective movie with Amada
might help me gain more .
Amada might gain a new ability soon...

Ken Amada
Do you want to watch the movie with me, Arisato-san?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's watch it together.
Now's a bad time.

Ken Amada
It looks like the director of the movies we watched has a huge repertoire...

Ken Amada
I learned that the director of the movies we watched actually has a huge repertoire.
So I rented a bunch of his other works.
Sad - I don't want to bother you, but... I was kind of hoping we could give Junpei-san some good recommendations.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It doesn't seem like Amada will gain any more
new skills even if I watch a DVD with him...
But watching a detective movie with him
might help me gain more .

Ken Amada
If you're not busy, do you want to watch the movie together?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's watch it together.
Now's a bad time.

Ken Amada
Happy - Okay. I'll set it up.

Ken Amada
Oh, I guess you do seem pretty busy... Maybe the next time you're free then.

Ken Amada
Oh! Did you want to watch?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It doesn't seem like Amada will gain any more
new skills even if I watch a DVD with him...
But watching a detective movie with him
might help me gain more .

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Watching a detective film with Amada
might help me gain more ...

Ken Amada
Um, if you're okay with it, maybe we can watch the movie together...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's watch it together.
Now's a bad time.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Amada seems to be having fun.
We just finished watching a
hard-boiled fiction movie together.

Ken Amada
Happy - That action scene during the climax was amazing, wasn't it?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I feel like I gained some  after
watching how a man of conviction lives...

Ken Amada
Happy - Speaking of action scenes, Japan's live-action superhero shows are just as good. Really!

-----

Ken Amada
They recommended this at the store when I said I was looking for a movie with a cool, hard-boiled main character.
But so far, he just seems like a reckless old man to me.
Sad - He even fell for that woman's lies... Do people really think this guy is cool?

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's right.
Probably not.
Just wait and see.

Ken Amada
Sad - Really? I don't get it.

Ken Amada
Happy - I thought so. It's definitely not cool to fall for such an obvious trick.

Ken Amada
Happy - Oh, that's right. We are only halfway through the movie.

Ken Amada
Surprised - He's surrounded by gangsters again...

Ken Amada
Happy - Wow... He was so cool!
Happy - He actually knew it was a lie the whole time, and he was just pretending to be tricked!

Ken Amada
Happy - His signature phrase was so good, too.

Ken Amada
Angry - "You can't be a detective without smarts, and you've got no right being a detective without a heart!"

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I feel like I gained some  after
watching how a man of conviction lives...

Ken Amada
Happy - Ohh, looks like this movie is part of a series!

Ken Amada
Happy - Let's watch the other ones together when you have time!

Ken Amada
This character really drinks a lot of alcohol.
Arisato-san, when you grow up, are you going to drink alcohol too?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I would like to.
I want to avoid alcohol.
Will you?

Ken Amada
I see. You should be careful about that.
I heard that drinking too much is bad for your health.

Ken Amada
But don't they say it's sometimes necessary to drink for work?
And that sometimes it's hard to say no. Being an adult is all about taking the shots you're given.
Surprised - ...Oh, I just made a pun, didn't I?

Ken Amada
Me? I've never thought about it, actually...
But I do hear that a lot of adults these days don't drink.

Ken Amada
Alcohol has a very mature feeling about it, doesn't it?
I don't think I'm a fan of all the rowdy parties, but having a nice glass does look kind of cool.
Speaking of, remember that bar scene...?

Ken Amada
Happy - Wow, it's late! Watching those bonus clips took longer than I thought.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I feel like I gained some  after
watching how a man of conviction lives...

Ken Amada
Happy - It's about time I head to bed. Good night.

Ken Amada
Happy - Wow, that was so good! And the main character was cool and in control until the very end!

Ken Amada
Happy - That last line he exchanged with the casino's boss gave me goosebumps!
Happy - And how about that part when he was all, "Count to five!"?

Ken Amada
Happy - I hope I can be like him when I'm an adult.
Arisato-san, what do you think it takes for a guy to be hard-boiled?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Always keeping your cool.
Excellent situational judgment.

Ken Amada
That's true. You can't really be hard-boiled if you're quick-tempered.
Happy - You have to keep calm and never let the enemy get under your skin.

Ken Amada
That's true. The detective did always make the right call, no matter what situation he was in.
He was compassionate but level-headed, and he never fell for the enemy's tricks.

Ken Amada
Sad - ...Come to think of it, that might be just what I need right now.

Ken Amada
Sad - I tend to get worked up about what's right in front of me, don't I?
Sad - That's exactly the kind of thing a kid would do... I need to fix that.

Ken Amada
Happy - Well, now's as good a time as any to start. I'll give it my best shot.
Happy - If I do that, do you think I could become like him?
Happy - A cool, hard-boiled guy, just like the detective in the movie...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Of course.
That's impossible.
It depends on your motivation.

Ken Amada
Happy - When I hear you say it, I really feel like it's possible.

Ken Amada
Happy - When you say it like that, I feel like I need to prove you wrong.

Ken Amada
Happy - Yeah, you're right.
Happy - Don't worry, I'll work hard and prove that I'm not just all talk.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Looks like Amada has learned
how to be an adult by observing
the movie's main character.

Ken Amada
Oh boy, look at the time.
Sad - But I still want to talk about the movie...

Ken Amada
Surprised - ...W-Wait, I'm not sleepy yet, okay?

Ken Amada
Zzz...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I feel like I gained some  after
watching how a man of conviction lives...

Ken Amada
...Ones who should kill... prepared to be...

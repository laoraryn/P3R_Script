Ken Amada
I know this is kinda coming out of nowhere, but... Um, would you like some coffee right now?
Not the instant stuff, but with properly ground beans and all that.
I saw someone prepare coffee on a show, and I wanted to try doing it myself...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Amada asked me to join him for coffee...
Should I spend the evening with him?

Ken Amada
Arisato-san, if you don't mind, could you maybe be my taste-tester?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure.
Not right now.

Ken Amada
I studied up a little on coffee beans.
I wanted to test some things out. Do you have some free time right now?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Amada asked me to join him for coffee...
Should I spend the evening with him?

Ken Amada
I promise I'll brew it correctly this time.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure.
Not right now.

Ken Amada
I was thinking about brewing some coffee right now.
I wanted to show you that I can do it properly...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Amada seems serious.
He might gain a new ability soon...
Should I spend the evening with Amada?

Ken Amada
Um, do you have some time right now?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Of course.
Not really.

Ken Amada
Oh, I was thinking about brewing some coffee. Would you like some?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It doesn't seem like Amada will gain any more
new skills even if I have coffee with him...

Ken Amada
Happy - It's like I'm a barista or something. This is pretty fun.
Happy - You can take your coffee to go if you want.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure, thanks.
Now's a bad time.

Ken Amada
Happy - Okay! I'll get started right away.

Ken Amada
Oh okay... Maybe next time, then.

Ken Amada
Oh, you'll join me for coffee?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It doesn't seem like Amada will gain any more
new skills even if I have coffee with him...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I spend the evening with Amada?

Ken Amada
I'd be happy if you could join me.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure.
Not right now.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Amada seems calm.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We passed the time
drinking coffee together...

Ken Amada
Sometimes adding milk and sugar is nice. But I usually take it black, of course.

Ken Amada
Happy - If you feel like meeting up for coffee again, just let me know.

-----

Ken Amada
Sad - Ngh, the inside of my mouth still tastes all—


Ken Amada
Surprised - ...Uh, I mean, coffee's meant to be taken black, don't you think? It's the only way to experience the natural taste of the beans.
The one from Brazil is very smooth, while the Kilimanjaro one is more sour and full-bodied.

Minato Arisato - Selection
You know a lot.
As long as it's drinkable.
Where's today's from?

Ken Amada
Happy - I read about it in a book. I also learned how to brew it and stuff.

Ken Amada
Sad - But it doesn't taste much different from the instant type... I wonder if the beans aren't good quality.

Ken Amada
I thought so too, but I heard the properly-brewed ones are completely different.

Ken Amada
Sad - That's why I tried to learn how to make it, but... honestly, they taste the same to me.

Ken Amada
Happy - Oh! Um, it's called a "Value Pack Blend." I bought it at the supermarket.

Ken Amada
Does the quality of the beans really affect the flavor that much? Maybe I'll try some better ones next time.

Ken Amada
Anyways, sorry for the sudden invite.
But they say that drinking coffee can help you relax and concentrate better.
I just thought something like that might benefit us in our upcoming battles.
Happy - And, I figured if I could learn to make good coffee, people might find that useful.
Happy - I'll do some more research. I can tell there's room for improvement...

Ken Amada
Sorry for asking you to help me clean up, too.

Ken Amada
Happy - Please, take the leftovers with you. Although, you might not necessarily like it...

Ken Amada
Sure, I'd prefer my coffee to taste good, but I could do without all the test sips...

Ken Amada
Surprised - Um! It's not that I don't appreciate the flavor, it's just that it's not good for an elementary school kid to drink too much, so...
And you seem like someone who'd appreciate a good cup of coffee, like from a café.

Ken Amada
Happy - I hope you have another cup the next time I make some. I'll make sure it tastes better by then.

Ken Amada
Happy - Well then, good night.

-----

Ken Amada
Happy - I'm using different beans today. I went to a coffee shop and bought some real ones this time!
Happy - I made sure to store them in the fridge, and I only ground them right before brewing.
Happy - I also learned you need to be mindful of how hot the water is as well as how you pour it.

Minato Arisato - Selection
You did a great job.
How sure are you?
It's gonna get cold.

Ken Amada
Happy - Yes, I practiced with the cheaper beans from before since I can't afford too many of the expensive ones.
Happy - ...Although it was hard to drink all that coffee, so I added a lot of milk and sugar.

Ken Amada
Well, I practiced with the cheaper beans from before since I can't afford too many of the expensive ones.
Although, this is the first time I'm brewing with these fancier beans. I wonder how it'll turn out...

Ken Amada
Surprised - Oh, sorry! You're right, coffee is best when it's hot and fresh!

Ken Amada
Happy - Well then, let's drink, shall we? Cheers, Arisato-san!

Ken Amada
Phew...
It's still really bitter... So bitter...
Happy - But it's not only that. I could actually taste some of the sweetness and richness this time.

Ken Amada
The beans and brewing technique can make a huge difference, huh? Oh, and the smell was great, too!
Happy - I'm feeling a little nostalgic, actually...

Ken Amada
Happy - Thanks for joining me, Arisato-san. You can go on ahead.
Happy - I'm gonna practice a little more to try and get the hang of this.
Happy - Let's make some more if we ever get the chance.

Ken Amada
Sad - Oh...

Ken Amada
Surprised - Uh, first I gotta use the bathroom...! I drank a lot while I was practicing today...

Ken Amada
So, I was hoping you could watch me as I make the coffee...

Ken Amada
Happy - Thank you!

Ken Amada
Okay, the beans are freshly ground and accurately measured. The water is about 90 degrees Celsius.
Now, the pace and angle when pouring the water are really important. All right, here I go.

Ken Amada
Pour slowly and quietly, in a circular motion...
You'll know you're doing it right when it starts smelling really good!

Ken Amada
......
Happy - It's not exactly what you'd get at a café, but I think I've improved a lot.
Happy - There's so much to consider when making coffee. I get why people are so particular about it.

Ken Amada
Um, I know it's a bit weird to ask at this point, but...
When do you feel like drinking coffee the most?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Right after waking up.
When I'm taking a break.
I don't really drink it much.

Ken Amada
Happy - That does seem to be common for a lot of people.
The taste and smell are a signal to start the day. It's sort of like flipping a switch in your head.

Ken Amada
Oh, I see... You know, that's the weird thing about the smell of coffee.
Happy - Drinking it is supposed to wake us up, but the smell has a relaxing effect, too.

Ken Amada
Oh... Are you more of a tea person, like Mitsuru-san?
In all honesty, I never really went out of my way to drink it, either.

Ken Amada
...When my mom was still alive, the house used to smell like this every morning.
Now I realize how often she'd make coffee, even on days she was busy.

Ken Amada
I saw on TV the other day that smells and memories are linked closely together.
The smell of coffee reminded me of my mom. But in your case...
I wonder if it'll remind you of the times we spent here, drinking coffee together.

Minato Arisato - Selection
It's a possibility.
Let's do it more often, then.

Ken Amada
Happy - Well, I better try extra hard when I'm making coffee for you, then!
Happy - It'd be pretty sad if you only remembered my coffee being bitter.

Ken Amada
Happy - In that case, I'd better practice and treat you to another cup while we still have time.
Happy - It'd be pretty sad if you only remembered my coffee being bitter.

Ken Amada
I feel like I haven't gotten into something like this for a long time.
I also think it's helped me practice staying focused. Maybe it's because I've been doing it so diligently.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Amada looks so satisfied
as he talks about coffee...

Ken Amada
Happy - Anyways, thanks a lot, Arisato-san.
Happy - Because of you, I think I understand the taste of coffee a little better now.

Ken Amada
Happy - Besides, if my mom liked it, I'm sure I will too.

Ken Amada
Happy - ...Oh, there's still more, if you want a refill!

Ken Amada
Happy - I've gotten a lot better now, so I hope you'll join me again sometime!
Happy - Next time, it's gonna be even better than it was today!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Ah, Arisato.
Exams are right around the corner... Have you been studying?
Happy - Remember, there's no shortcut to success... Persistence is key.
Even if you study every day, it takes time to see results.
So keep working at it. Don't assume that, after one or two sessions, you've mastered the material.
I suggest studying in the library if you have the time to spare.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Are you leaving now, Arisato?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's walk home together.
Yeah. See you later.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - ...Sorry, I'm busy at the moment.
Sad - I need to make some time to study. There's a lot to cover, like the material on college entrance exams.
Make sure you don't neglect your own studies as well.
Happy - I know you have other things to worry about, but studying should be a student's number one priority.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru seems to be worried
about my study habits...
It seems that she wants to focus
on her .
Maybe if I was a , then
she'd spare me some time.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - ...Sorry, I'm busy at the moment.
Sad - I'd love to talk to you, but I've got a lot on my mind right now.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru seems very busy with
her student council work...
I think I need to be closer with
Mitsuru before we can hang out...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - All right. Be careful on your way back.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sorry for the sudden call.
I'll keep it brief. I wanted to hand this to you.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru handed me an envelope.
There's some kind of paperwork inside...

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'd appreciate it if you could deliver that to Aragaki.
Tell him it's from me. He'll know what's inside: a school reinstatement form.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'm sure you're already aware, but Aragaki is a student at our school. He's currently on a leave of absence.
If he's in good health, I believe it's in his best interest to start attending classes again.
Sad - But no matter what I, or even Akihiko, say to him... he won't have any of it.
Sad - So I'm changing my approach... Perhaps you may be able to get through to him.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
......
Mitsuru seems to be in need of
help. I guess I should accept...

Mitsuru Kirijo
...Can I count on you?

Minato Arisato - Selection
All right.
Don't expect much.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Thank you... I'm sorry I got you involved in this.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Of course. I was running out of options anyway.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I really do apologize for the trouble, but I trust you'll keep this matter confidential.
It would only become more difficult to persuade him if this became public.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Aragaki is usually at **that gathering spot near the station** during the day.
When you get the chance, could you head over there to look for him? I'm counting on you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Aragaki is usually at **that gathering spot near the station** during the day.
Happy - If you don't mind, I'd appreciate it if you could go and check on him there.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, there you are. How did it go?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - Is that...?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I handed over the form to extend
Aragaki's leave of absence.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Right... I thought as much.
Sad - He's certainly stubborn, I'll give him that. But this is his decision, so there's nothing more we can do.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I apologize for making you run back and forth so much.
Happy - But thanks to you, I think I can finally lay this matter to rest. I appreciate your help.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Not a problem.
Tell me what's going on.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - ......
After everything you've done, I suppose I do owe you an explanation.
But not here. Let's relocate to the student council room. I assure you it won't take long.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Planning on heading back?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah...
I'll stay a little longer.

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right, then let's be off.

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right. Let me know when you leave.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, it's you. Did you need something?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's walk home together.
Nah, see you later.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Are you asking me to hang out with you?
Exasperated* - I don't mean to be rude, but shouldn't you be devoting more time to your studies?
Happy - School should be a student's number one priority. I don't respect those who take their education for granted.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru seems to be worried
about my study habits...
It seems that she wants to focus
on her .
Maybe if I was a , then
she'd spare me some time.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Take care.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Ah, Arisato.
I've been hearing a lot about you lately. It sounds like you're studying hard.
Happy - I'm impressed. But try not to stress yourself out.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru acknowledged the effort
I've put into my .
This might be my chance
to get to know her better...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - By the way, Arisato...
Sad - This is completely unrelated, but...
Sad - I'd like to talk to you about something.
Sad - If you don't mind... can you spare some time?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure.
Sorry, I'm busy.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Excellent. Well, um...
Sad - Could you come with me? I'd rather not talk about it here.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I-I see... That's unfortunate.
Well, perhaps another time then. I'll see you later.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Arisato...
Things have finally settled down a bit.
Happy - I'll be shifting more responsibilities onto the underclassmen in the student council so that they can gain more experience.
And with all that's happened, I'd like to have some time for myself...
Happy - I'll still show up to the meetings, of course.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, Arisato...
What a coincidence. Are you leaving now?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru seems interested in my plans...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Unused

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Oh... Arisato.
Sad - Um, I need to talk to you.
Looking away - I'm pretty sure you already know about what...
Sad - I just... need to tell you what's on my mind.
Looking away - ......
Looking away - We can talk later if you don't have the time now.

Mitsuru Kirijo
O-Oh, Arisato.
Sad - Um, is anything wrong? If not, then maybe we could...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I spend some time
after school with Mitsuru?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Spend time with her
Check Social Link status
Not now

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Okay, then let's get going. It's rare for me to have any free time...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Unused

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - A-All right then.
Sad - In that case... could we go to the roof?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Okay...
So, um... where should we go?
Sad - How about...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - ......
Sad - How about... my room?
Happy - There's something I'd like to give you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Exasperated* - ...Do you understand what I just said?
......
Oh, all right. Get ready to leave.
Happy - We'll go to my room...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Oh, I see...
Sad - ......
Sad - ...See you later, then.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...Arisato.
I don't think we should talk so often at school...
Happy - You bring out a side of me that I'd rather keep private...
...Hm? Here, let me get that.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru fixed my ribbon...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - There, that's better.
......
...Don't worry. No one saw me.
We don't need words to communicate with each other, so I may not need to tell you this...
But from now on, let's concentrate on the future.
Happy - Right, Minato...?
Happy - ......

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I feel an unbreakable bond
with Mitsuru...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Looking away - Oh, Arisato. I apologize for what happened the other day.
Sad - I was hoping we could have some time to talk things out.
I, um... dragged you into something awful, didn't I?
Would you happen to be free right now?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - ...Thank you.
I plan on having tea with Yukari and the others later. You should join us.
Happy - We're meeting in my room at the dorm. Why don't we head back now?

Mitsuru Kirijo
I see. Then I'll ask again when you have the time.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, Arisato.
Happy - Do you have any plans today? If not, then maybe we could...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Hehe, that's good to hear.
You've shown me so many new things, so I'd like to return the favor this time.
Happy - With that said... let's head back to the dorm first.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I see. Maybe another time, then.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...Arisato.
Do you have some business with me? Or are you headed to the faculty office to discuss your career path?
I'm currently reviewing my own path at the moment.
Happy - Don't worry, I'm not lost or confused...
It's just that so many doors of opportunity have opened up to me—at least compared to before.
...I want to seize this chance to see what exactly I'm capable of.
Happy - Had it not been for you, I never would have gained this new perspective... So thank you.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I feel an unbreakable bond
with Mitsuru...

Mitsuru Kirijo
B-By the way, are you leaving now...? Well, what a coincidence.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Things have finally settled down a bit.
I'll be shifting more responsibilities onto the underclassmen in the student council so that they can gain more experience.
Happy - And with all that's happened, I'd like to have some time for myself...
I'll still show up to the meetings, of course.

Mitsuru Kirijo
So, did you need something?

Mitsuru Kirijo
I've been hearing a lot about you lately. It sounds like you're studying hard.
Happy - I'm impressed. But try not to stress yourself out.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Ah, Arisato. You must be relieved that exams are over.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - By studying every day, exams no longer appear intimidating. Perhaps you should give that a try.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Good work. I think we can afford to relax a little bit for now.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, it's you. I was just thinking of leaving as well.
Happy - If it's all right with you... would you care to join me today?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, right. I was just thinking of leaving as well.
Happy - If it's all right with you... would you care to join me today?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Thank you.
Actually... there was another place I was hoping to stop by today.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh... Arisato. Are you leaving now?
If that's the case, there was a place I wanted to stop by on the way back...

Mitsuru Kirijo
By the way, are you leaving now?
If that's the case, there was a place I wanted to stop by on the way back...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Thank you. It's over at the strip mall, so it shouldn't take long to get there.
Sad - It piqued my interest a while ago, but I could never bring myself to go alone...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Ah, Arisato. Are you leaving now?
Sad - I have to visit the library today to study up on business administration and management.
If you aren't too busy, perhaps you could help me?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Are you leaving now?
Sad - I have to visit the library today to study up on business administration and management.
If you aren't too busy, perhaps you could help me?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Thanks, I appreciate it.
Happy - That said, I'm certain I know where to find what I'm looking for. It shouldn't take up too much time.
Truth be told, asking you to come along was just an excuse. I hope we'll have some time to chat afterwards.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Ah, Arisato.
Happy - I have somewhere to be later. Would you like to join me?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Ah, right. I have somewhere to be later. Would you like to join me?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - ...Thank you.
Happy - The truth is... a friend of ours told me that I should go out and unwind.
Normally, I wouldn't give it another thought, but... I admit it might do me some good this time.
Happy - Shall we go, then?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Ah, Arisato.
I was considering stopping by the library before leaving...

Mitsuru Kirijo
By the way, Arisato, do you have some time right now?
I was considering stopping by the library before leaving...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I see... You're a very diligent student.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, it's you. Are you leaving already?
Sad - If you don't have any plans, I'd like to stop by somewhere before heading back.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Are you leaving already, Arisato?
Sad - If you don't have any plans, I'd like to stop by somewhere before heading back.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Thank you. I'm grateful you always make time for me. But still...
Happy - I'm not sure if I should order the same thing as last time or try something completely new.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Ah, Arisato. What are your plans for today?
Happy - If you aren't busy, I was hoping you'd join me to see another movie.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, by the way, what are your plans for today?
Happy - If you aren't busy, I was hoping you'd join me to see another movie.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Fantastic. There's no one I'd rather go with than y—

Sad - ...Ahem, never mind me. Let's get going.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Um, I need to talk to you.
Looking away - I'm pretty sure you already know about what...
Sad - I just... need to tell you what's on my mind.
Sad - ......
Sad - We can talk later if you don't have the time now.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Looking away - ...Um, I apologize for what happened the other day.
Sad - I, um... dragged you into something awful, didn't I?
I was hoping we could have some time to talk things out.
Would you happen to be free right now?

Mitsuru Kirijo
U-Um, by the way, Arisato...
Sad - Um, is anything wrong? If not, then maybe we could...

Mitsuru Kirijo
...Arisato.
Happy - Do you have any plans today? If not, then maybe...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I see...
Oh, don't mind me. Take care on your way back.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...I see. Then if you'll excuse me.
I'll talk to you later.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - ...I see.
Happy - Let me know when you have time. Until then.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, I see.
Happy - Then I suppose it will have to wait until next time.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...I see.
Sad - ......
Sad - I'll talk to you later, then.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I-I see...
Sad - ......
...Oh, apologies. I'll talk to you later.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I see.
Sad - Let me know when you're free as soon as you can.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, I-I see...
Sad - ......
Sad - ...I'll talk to you later, then.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I see. Maybe another day, then.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Looking away - Oh, I-I see...
Sad - ......
...N-No, it's nothing. Don't mind me.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I see. I'll ask you again if the opportunity presents itself.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - ...You can rely on me anytime if anything were to happen. Well then, I'll see you back at the dorm.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - It's a lovely place, wouldn't you agree?
When I was younger, I used to come here fairly often... But I haven't had the chance to visit since starting high school.

Mitsuru Kirijo
......

Mitsuru Kirijo
...Oh, it's you.
If you want to know more about the trip, you can find the details in the itinerary over there.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...I apologize if I've made you worried.
But I won't falter any longer. I'll keep moving forward, steady at your side.

-----

Mitsuru Kirijo
...I see.
A happiness equal to the hardship, perhaps...?
It's hard to imagine what form it will take, but I'd like to believe that's true.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...Yes, you're right.
I'm sure the same was true for my father...
Happy - I believe he found his own form of happiness.

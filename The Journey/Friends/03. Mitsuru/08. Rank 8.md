Mitsuru Kirijo
I'd been interested in seeing that film for a while now. It was a fascinating watch...
Happy - While the road trip plot was nothing out of the ordinary, the way the characters expressed their emotions was masterful.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - When the main character left everything behind to go on a journey... That really struck a chord with me.

Mitsuru Kirijo
......

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - And then, in the final scene, he decided to return to his normal life... I wonder if he was happy with that decision.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Say, Arisato...
Have you ever thought of running away to a place like that?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Somewhere far away, where no one knows who you are?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yes.
No.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - ...I see. So you feel that way too sometimes.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - ...I see. You really are strong.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'm not saying I wish to leave everything behind.
It's just that... every now and then, the things that matter are the very things that hold you back.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Exasperated* - The future of the company... The weight of my responsibilities...
Exasperated* - Sometimes I even wish that I wasn't shackled by the Kirijo family name...
Sad - ......

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - ...I know. I understand that I can't afford to think this way.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Listen to me, complaining like this... How pathetic.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Talking to you has become something of an outlet for me. Heh, I'm sure you're sick of it by now.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Vent all you want.
This isn't like you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...That's very kind of you.
The offer is quite tempting. I hope you know what you're getting into.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru seems to trust me.
I feel like our relationship has grown...

Mitsuru Kirijo
While we're on the topic, there's something I'd like to ask you...
Sad - ......

Mitsuru Kirijo
Exasperated* - ...Yes, that wasn't very becoming of me. I hope I didn't offend you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Well, I know how understanding you are. I'm sure you're just trying to encourage me.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru seems to trust me.
I feel like our relationship has grown...

Mitsuru Kirijo
While we're on the topic, there's something I'd like to ask you...
Sad - ......

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hypothetically, let's say that I was... interested in someone right now.
I knew I could never be with him, but even so, I couldn't help but harbor these feelings...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Would that be... wrong?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Ah... Keep in mind, this is a what-if scenario.

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's up to you.
It's not meant to be.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - ...!
Surprised - Up to... me?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - ...I see.
You're right. I would be betraying the promise I made to my fiancé.
That makes sense.

Man's Voice
Ahh, there you are!
Hey, Mitsuru!

Well-Dressed Man
I've been looking all over for you. So this is where you've been!

Well-Dressed Man
Come on, let's go.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - What...?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - Wait a minute. I didn't make any plans with you for today...

Well-Dressed Man
What does it matter? I managed to secure an opening in my schedule tonight.
I'm a very busy man, you know. As a simple student, you're just going to have to work around it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I can't... I've already made plans.

Well-Dressed Man
Do you know how long I spent looking for you?

Well-Dressed Man
Don't tell me you have something more important to do than spend time with me.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - ......

Well-Dressed Man
Why the long face? You're supposed to be my fiancée, you know.

Well-Dressed Man
Honestly... I thought you understood our arrangement.
If you're going to be my future wife, you'll need to learn some obedience.

Well-Dressed Man
Why must you and your family always be so difficult?
Well, at least your father's not around anymore, so that's something of a relief.

Well-Dressed Man
I imagine you feel the same.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - Wha—

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - How dare you say that!?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Calm down, Mitsuru.
Don't insult her father!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - ...Stay out of this.
Angry - I don't care who he is. I won't let that comment stand!

Well-Dressed Man
Excuse me? You think you can get away with speaking to me like that?

Well-Dressed Man
Of course you can't. The future of the Kirijo family depends on you.

Well-Dressed Man
Anything you do could affect the entire organization.
I'm sure even a high schooler like you can comprehend the consequences of your actions.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - ...!
Thank you, Arisato.

Well-Dressed Man
Who the hell are you!?
This is none of your business. Get lost!

Well-Dressed Man
Come on, Mitsuru... You know how this works. Corporate management is not child's play.
No matter how smart you are, you're still going to need my knowledge and experience.
And the Kirijo Group still needs the cooperation of my company, doesn't it?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - ......
Sad - Yes...

Well-Dressed Man
Good girl, Mitsuru. I knew you would listen to reason.
Now, let's go. I've made reservations for us at a luxurious restaurant!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - ...All right.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Arisato... I wish you hadn't seen that.
Happy - Thank you for today. It was quite fun.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I'm sorry. Really...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Please excuse me.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Don't give in.
You're sure about this?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - It's all right, Arisato...
Sad - I appreciate the sentiment, though.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Well... I mean...

Well-Dressed Man
Come on, Mitsuru, hurry up.

Well-Dressed Man
By the way... You!
Who do you think you are, worming your way into her favor?

Well-Dressed Man
You ought to know your place in society.
A commoner like you isn't even fit to breathe the same air.
Don't you understand? You're just a nuisance.

Well-Dressed Man
Hmph... Unbelievable.

Well-Dressed Man
There's a world of difference between you and us. Mitsuru, take care not to associate with his kind anymore.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - Enough.

Well-Dressed Man
Mitsuru...?

Well-Dressed Man
[cut 5 2 0]

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - I said that's enough!
Angry - I won't let you insult him!

Well-Dressed Man
Wh-What...!? Why are you getting so angry!?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - This is someone I have a great deal of respect for. If you insult him, you insult me!

Well-Dressed Man
M-Mitsuru!?

Well-Dressed Man
What are you saying!? You would side with him over me...?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - You said there was a world of difference between you and him.
Angry - Well, you're right. You can't compare to him at all!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Very angry* - He stands on his own two feet, challenging fate with his own strength of will.
Very angry* - Seeing his outlook on life has inspired and influenced me countless times!

Well-Dressed Man
This guy...?
What do you mean he's inspired and influenced you? What are you trying to say!?
You're supposed to be my fiancée!

Well-Dressed Man
Are you implying I'm beneath this nobody!? Take that back this instant, Mitsuru!
It's not too late to ask for forgiveness! Think about the future of your company!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Very angry* - Don't make me repeat myself. I have a great deal of respect for him!
Very angry* - I strive to be just like him in the future. You couldn't hope to understand.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Very angry* - The Group will do just fine on its own. We don't need help from a weasel like you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Very angry* - As of today, we'll have nothing to do with each other.
Very angry* - And if you dare to attempt some petty retaliation, then next time, you'll have the full might of the Group to contend with.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - Get out of here, you philistine! I don't want to see your face ever again!

Well-Dressed Man
Wha...? Ahh...

Well-Dressed Man
Grandpa! Grandpa!

Mitsuru Kirijo
......
Sorry you had to see all that. I don't know how I'll make this up to you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - He could have said whatever he wanted about me, and I would've taken it.
Happy - But... when he mentioned my father, and you... I couldn't help myself.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Don't sweat it.
You were awesome.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Heh, I'd certainly like to be so carefree...
Exasperated* - Still, I can't help but laugh at how stupid I was for letting someone like that take advantage of me.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Oh, come on now...
If we get down to it, it was my own inaction that led things to this point.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Thanks to you, though, my eyes have finally been opened.
Happy - ......

Mitsuru Kirijo
When I said that I have a great deal of respect for you, I meant every word.

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right. It's been a rather eventful day, but we should head back.
Happy - I'll be sure to make up for this disturbance at a later time, but for now, let's move on with the evening.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru's expression looks bright.
We decided to return to the dorm.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - You said there was a world of difference between you and him.
Angry - Well, you're right. You can't compare to him at all!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Very angry* - He stands on his own two feet, challenging fate with his own strength of will.
Very angry* - Seeing his outlook on life has inspired and influenced me countless times!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Exasperated* - I-I...
Exasperated* - I want to be with him!
Exasperated* - Now...

Mitsuru Kirijo
And forever!

Well-Dressed Man
You want to be with him?

Well-Dressed Man
Now and forever...? What are you trying to say!?

Well-Dressed Man
You're supposed to be my fiancée!

Well-Dressed Man
Are you implying I'm beneath this nobody!? Take that back this instant, Mitsuru!

Well-Dressed Man
It's not too late to ask for forgiveness! Think about the future of your company!

Mitsuru Kirijo
I will not apologize!
I want to be with him.
You're not the one supporting me in my time of need...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Very angry* - The Group will do just fine on its own. We don't need help from a weasel like you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Very angry* - As of today, we'll have nothing to do with each other.
Very angry* - And if you dare to attempt some petty retaliation, then next time, you'll have the full might of the Group to contend with.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - Get out of here, you philistine! I don't want to see your face ever again!

Well-Dressed Man
Wha...? Ahh...

Well-Dressed Man
Grandpa! Grandpa!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - Ah...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - I-I...
Exasperated* - ......

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
......
I decided to return to the dorm...

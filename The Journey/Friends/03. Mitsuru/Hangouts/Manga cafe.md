Mitsuru Kirijo   
I didn't realize how many different genres of manga there are...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Arisato, may I ask you something?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Why would people frequent net cafés, or even a manga café, such as this one?   
You can't borrow any of the books, like at a library...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...And you have to pay an entrance fee as well.   
Since manga aren't that expensive, why don't people just buy them?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's a nice environment.   
Buying manga adds up.   
Lack of storage space.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I see...   
Well, I guess you can buy food and drinks here, and they stay open late.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Mitsuru seems convinced.   
I learned a little more about her today.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I suppose that's true.   
But there's a certain joy that comes from owning a book, especially one you really love.   
In which case, it'd be worth buying no matter what the price.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Mitsuru seems to have made up her mind.   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That's understandable.   
I suppose the café is like your very own personal library, then.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Even though you can't borrow manga, you can read them whenever you want.   
That's an interesting perspective.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Mitsuru seems somewhat impressed.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - There's no manga in my parents' study, but perhaps I could repurpose a room to store them.   
I'd like you to select what to add to my collection. A lot of manga are considered masterpieces, correct?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I answered all of Mitsuru's questions about   
manga on the way back to the dorm.

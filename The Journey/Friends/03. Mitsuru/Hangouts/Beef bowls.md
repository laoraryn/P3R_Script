Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I apologize for making you come to a place like this on your day off.
Though I suppose this place probably isn't all that unusual to you, is it?

Mitsuru Kirijo
But, for me, it was quite an experience.
Happy - I never thought a dish as simple as beef and white rice would taste so rich and savory.

Mitsuru Kirijo
There is one thing that's been on my mind, though...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Do women not... typically eat at this shop?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I didn't see many female customers there... Or was it just my imagination?

Minato Arisato - Selection
It's all in your head.
You might be right.
Does it really matter?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I-I see. If you say so...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru still seems bothered by it.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - You think so, too?
...W-Well, you accompanied me today, so I shan't be bothered by it.
In fact, I'll enjoy every meal without paying any mind to what others may think from now on.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru seems happy.
I learned a little more about her today.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Y-You're right.
Happy - I'm overthinking it. I shouldn't pay any mind to such trivial matters.
Lately, I've begun to realize that I've led quite a sheltered life.
I want to change that... So thank you, Arisato.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru seems happy.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - But, I must say, this area is rather lively. I can feel my spirits lift just being here.
If you're in no hurry, could we look around for a little longer?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We walked around the strip mall for a little
while before heading back to the dorm.

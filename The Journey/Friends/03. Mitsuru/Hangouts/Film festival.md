Today, they're showing the "Eternal Love" series... It appears to be a set of classic romances.
Now that I think about it, I may never have seen such a straightforward love story before...
Happy - Well, this should be something of an experience. Let's make the most of it.

Prince from Another Country
There's something I need to tell you... I'm sorry I couldn't say this sooner, but I'm actually a prince from another country.

Prince from Another Country
Forgive me for not being more honest with you. But believe me when I say that my love could not be more real!

Village Girl
But... I love you, too! Wherever you go, I'll be right by your side!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It seems love takes many forms...
I've learned the difference
between love and infatuation...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - ...Is that really the standard for "eternal love"?
Sad - In the final scene, how did the man so conveniently determine where the woman was?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - And why would he wait until the last moment to announce that he's secretly a prince?
Hurt - Why couldn't he tell her sooner? That's simply lackluster storytelling!

Mitsuru Kirijo
And not only that, but the film ended just as the two began to settle down. Nothing to show of what comes after.
Sad - If the writers knew how royalty actually lived, they wouldn't have called that a happy ending.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - In fact, that's when the most difficult part begins.
Sad - ......

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - Er— My apologies. I didn't intend to be overly critical...
Sad - I just... couldn't help but compare it to my own life.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - In a way, I suppose that means I must have enjoyed it quite a bit.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru and I returned to the dorm.

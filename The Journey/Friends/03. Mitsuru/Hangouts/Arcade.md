Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - This place is so loud... I'm exhausted.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
But I must admit I was impressed with the racing game. You know, the one with the motorcycle.   
Happy - It felt just like riding the real thing!   
And to think, there's still so much more I've yet to experience myself.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
May I ask you something?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
How much does one of those arcade machines with a life-sized motorcycle cost?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You're gonna buy one?   
I don't know.   
But you have a real one.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - I was considering it, but... Wait.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Is this not something people would normally buy?   
...Well, I suppose not, if people came all the way to an arcade to spend pocket change on a game.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - S-Sorry, there I go again, saying something a normal person wouldn't...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Mitsuru seems embarrassed.   
I learned a little more about her today.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - I was thinking I could play while I'm on standby...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
But the dorm is probably not an appropriate place for it, is it...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Never mind, then.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Mitsuru seems disappointed.   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Well, that's true, but...   
......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - ...Actually, you're right. I should spend time maintaining my own motorcycle.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Mitsuru looks happy.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Do you come here fairly often? I'd like to know more about the other games as well...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
We talked about the games we played   
today on our way back to the dorm.

Happy - I'm pleased to see that the classical music section had such a vast selection...
Happy - I didn't expect this store to be so well stocked.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I had no idea there were so many different artists and songs.
And, unlike the classical genre, it seems that most music today is completely new and original.
But, with so many different artists and styles of music, how do people choose their favorites?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - ......
Um, Arisato?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Would you mind telling me who your favorite musical artist is?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Why?
Tell me yours.
I don't listen to music.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - W-Well...
I just wanted to listen to the same music you do.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru seems embarrassed.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Well, I'm not very familiar with today's popular music, so...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - ...Wait, didn't I ask you first?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru seems to be having fun.
I learned a little more about her today.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...Really?
But you always have headphones around your neck...
So then, if not music, what are you listening to? Audio books?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru seems puzzled.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right. Instead of just standing around, should we grab a quick bite before going back?
Ramen, burgers, takoyaki... or something else... It's a tough call.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After enjoying a meal together,
we headed back to the dorm.

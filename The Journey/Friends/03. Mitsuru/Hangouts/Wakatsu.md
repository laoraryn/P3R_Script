Mitsuru Kirijo
......
Happy - The food here is delicious.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Um, I want to ask you something...
A-And I'd like you to answer honestly...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Are you...
...interested in anyone?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yes.
Nope.
Why do you ask?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I see...
Sad - But I—


Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - O-Oh, never mind... Please forget I said anything.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru seems a little sad...
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - Oh, I see...
So, I have a chance...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - O-Oh, never mind... Please forget I said anything.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru is mumbling to herself...
I learned a little more about her today.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - ...!
Sad - Um, I mean, you know... I just—


Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - Wh-What's with the smile!?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru looks flustered.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I've lost my appetite...
Sad - I really wanted to try asking for a "second helping" while we're here, but...
I'm a little overwhelmed right now, so you should ask for seconds in my stead.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I ate until my stomach felt like it'd explode
before heading back to the dorm.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - So this is one of Wakatsu's meals. I can see why it's so popular.
Mmm... The smell of freshly fried food only makes it look even more delicious.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Um, could I ask you something?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Why did they give us this lemon on the side? I don't suppose it's dessert...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Squeeze it over your food.
You don't have to use it.
It's dessert.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - ...!
Surprised - I see... The acidity of the lemon juice provides a nice contrast to the fried food, enhancing the flavor.
Surprised - How sensible! Everything you need is provided on this one plate!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru seems to be having fun.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Really now?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Then why include it? Is it for dessert, after all?
Oh well, I suppose it doesn't matter. Let's just eat.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru is talking to herself...
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - ...R-Really!?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - So I was right? But I imagine it'd be far too sour...
Surprised - No, wait... Eating fried food may lead to heartburn, so perhaps this lemon is meant for cleansing your palate after a meal...?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru's eyes are sparkling
with excitement...
I learned a little more about her today.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I also wanted to try asking for a "second helping" while we're here...
Can you show me how it's done by ordering seconds for yourself?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I ate until I was stuffed and
returned to the dorm.

Interesting... So this "takoyaki" doesn't contain an entire octopus, but only a small portion.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - I mean, that does make sense... The entire creature would be far too large for a single person.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sometimes my own ignorance truly astounds me...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Want me to treat you?
Why not give it a try?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Heh, who do you think I am?
Happy - Please, allow me to be the one to treat you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - ...What? They don't accept credit cards!?
......

Mitsuru Kirijo
Seeing is believing, I suppose...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Excuse me, um... One piece of takoyaki, please.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - ...What? O-Oh, they're only sold in multiples?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - How generous... So I'll receive an entire tray for this price...

Mitsuru Kirijo
So it's filled with diced octopus... Interesting.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Mmm... There's a mild sourness, combined with the chewy texture of the seafood... Quite flavorful.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - ...Hm? Are there other ingredients mixed in?
Happy - In any case, it's quite good. C'est très bon!

Mitsuru Kirijo
That reminds me, Akihiko once mentioned this place.
......

Mitsuru Kirijo
Speaking of Akihiko... Don't you think he's been acting differently lately?
I can't place my finger on it, but I've known him for quite a long time... It feels like something's changed.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Maybe he's just maturing...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Are you sad?
Are you happy?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Why would I be sad? I'm glad to see he's finally growing up.
Happy - You're reading too much into it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Of course I'm happy.
With all that we've been through, it can be difficult to get over what's happened in the past...
But Akihiko is using his experiences to make himself stronger.
I'm quite impressed by that.

Mitsuru Kirijo
When I look at Akihiko, I can't help but reflect upon my own life.
Happy - It's the most peculiar feeling.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Maybe you're in love.
Maybe you're anxious.
It must be sadness.

Mitsuru Kirijo
"In love"...? No, it's not that.
Is that how it looks to you? I didn't realize.

Mitsuru Kirijo
He's just a friend... Or should I say, teammate? It's a bit hard to describe.

Mitsuru Kirijo
In any case, that is the extent of our relationship.

Mitsuru Kirijo
"Anxious"...? Hm, you may be right.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Maybe a part of me is panicking because I feel like I'm being left behind...

Mitsuru Kirijo
...Sorry, don't mind me.

Mitsuru Kirijo
As graduation day approaches, I do find myself feeling melancholy now and then...
Happy - Heh, I suppose this is something a second-year can't relate to just yet.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru seems to have a lot on her mind.
I feel like our relationship has grown...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I don't even know what I'm talking about.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sorry to subject you to my thoughtless rambling. Just forget I said anything.

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'm rooting for you.
I heard nothing.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hm? I'm not sure what you mean.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Thank you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
That takoyaki was absolutely delicious. We should eat here again sometime.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I decided to go back to the dorm...

Mitsuru Kirijo   
Um... I know what you want to say.   
Sad - Our maid staff assisted with the furnishings. I recognize it's a bit beyond standard for a dorm room.   
Happy - It's almost like a second lounge, isn't it?   
Happy - Haha, Yukari says that to me all the time...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Oh... I almost forgot.   
Here. I want you to have this.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's the key to my motorcycle.   
I'm not going to run from my future anymore.   
Happy - Rather... there's no longer any need to.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I don't have to think of my motorcycle as a means of escaping my feelings.   
Happy - Though I do regret that I won't be riding it as often anymore...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'd... rather ride with you.   
Of course, you'll have to sit on the back until you get your license...   
But when this is all over, I'll teach you how to ride yourself.   
Happy - I'll be looking forward to it.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'll give it a try.   
I'm fine with the back.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Please do, but remember to be careful.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Oh... Is that so? Well, if that's what you prefer, I suppose.   
Happy - ......   
Sad - Still... I'd like to be the one holding on to you now and then.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
......   
Happy - It's... still a bit embarrassing to call you by your first name.   
But when we're alone, no one else can hear me.   
Your name... is more than just a name to me. It's something special.   
If I were in danger, it would be my last, desperate call for help.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
......   
Right... So, um...   
Sad - Minato, I... I want to be with you tonight...   
Will you... stay with me?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Mitsuru has professed her love to me,   
and seems to want mine in return...

The Empress Social Link reached its maximum level! You can now fuse **Alilat**, the ancient goddess!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - This... really is embarrassing...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I shared a special evening with Mitsuru.

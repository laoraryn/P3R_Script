Mitsuru Kirijo
Interesting... So this is what the interior looks like...
It's smaller than I expected.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Is this your first time?
Do you know how to eat it?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Well, technically, yes. But I did pass by once with Akihiko...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - So... I understand that you don't eat with utensils here?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Exasperated* - My lack of knowledge on this subject is a serious problem.

Mitsuru Kirijo
In all honesty, it's a good thing you're here.

Mitsuru Kirijo
O-Of course, don't be ridiculous.
Sad - ...Or so I'd like to say, but truthfully, I'm not that familiar.
Sad - I saw a commercial for fast food once, but I didn't expect that picking it up with bare hands was the norm...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Exasperated* - Just goes to show how out of touch I am.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - My lack of knowledge on this subject is a serious problem.

Mitsuru Kirijo
In all honesty, it's a good thing you're here.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Is it actually profitable to sell these items at such low prices?
I'd be interested to know the average cost per unit...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, sorry. I found myself lost in thought again.
In truth, I didn't ask you here just to eat...

Mitsuru Kirijo
I wanted to express my personal thanks to you.
Right now, our strength and conviction are being tested to their limits.
We've only made it this far because we've been blessed with each other's partnership.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I know I've been asking a lot of you—even more than the others. But I truly appreciate it.
I just wanted to make sure you knew that.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru seems to trust me...
I feel like our relationship has grown...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hm? Oh, I didn't realize we were talking for so long.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It would be rude to let the food grow cold. Shall we begin?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I ate burgers with Mitsuru, then
headed back to the dorm.

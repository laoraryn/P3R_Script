Mitsuru Kirijo
I think I've acquired a taste for fast food.
Just the other day, I had the urge to ride my motorcycle out at night to buy some.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Heh... It's your fault that I'm having these temptations now, you know.
......

Mitsuru Kirijo
Do you remember when I told you I was hesitant to meet up with you like this?
I'd like it if you could forget I ever said that.

Mitsuru Kirijo
We both sleep under the same roof—there's no point in stressing over it.
And besides...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Exasperated* - I just need to steel my resolve.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Say, Arisato. I have just one favor to ask.
Happy - Could you continue to show me new places like this? Just until graduation.
I'd like to see more of this world that I've been so blind to.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Or... is that too selfish a request?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I don't mind at all.
Is that all you need?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - ...Thank you, Arisato.
Happy - Let's make some wonderful memories with what little time we have left.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Well...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - ...No, this is fine. This is the decision I've made.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I'd like to focus on enjoying what little time we have left.

Mitsuru Kirijo
You've taught me so many new things.
Whether you're taking command in battle, or just talking with me like this...
Happy - As long as I have these memories of you, I'll be all right.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...Or so I hope.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can sense Mitsuru's resolve.
Our relationship has grown...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Now then, the day is still young.
Happy - You promised me your time. I'd like you to make good on that now.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I hung out with Mitsuru until it
was time to return to the dorm.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It's so simple... You just purchase a ticket at the window, and then walk in to enjoy a film...
Happy - This may sound silly to you, but I've always wanted to try the whole theater experience.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Even though we sat at the end of the aisle, I didn't feel that my view was compromised in the least...
It seems a lot of thought goes into the design and construction of a movie theater.

Minato Arisato - Selection
...Said the rich girl.
Glad you enjoyed it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - H-Hey now. This was my first time having the freedom to choose my own seat—I'm simply impressed by the options.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - It's thanks to you, Arisato. I've never felt comfortable enough to come here alone.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I'm sure most people don't consider this to be such a big deal...
I imagine someone like Yukari would have no reservations seeing a movie by herself.
She's likely more suited to riding a motorcycle than I am, as well.

Minato Arisato - Selection
A motorcycle?
You're not suited?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Yes, you must have seen it when I rode in to provide support for the team.
However... that wasn't my original motivation for getting it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
With a motorcycle, I can go where I want, when I want, all on my own.
Happy - You could say it's my modest attempt at rebellion against the many restrictions of my life.

Mitsuru Kirijo
After it was damaged, I considered letting go... But ultimately, I decided to have it repaired instead.
Happy - I don't regret it. Even now, I spend my time tuning it whenever I can.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I don't quite mean to say that...
It's just that my time available for riding is limited.
Lately, I find myself dreaming about driving to some far-off destination without telling a soul...
Happy - Well, fantasizing can be fun in its own way.

Minato Arisato - Selection
What a high-class biker.
Let's go for a ride.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It sounds strange, doesn't it? Well, maybe it is.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Everyone is against me riding it. They think it's too dangerous.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Even so, I'm quite fond of it. Maybe you should give it a try yourself, if you're so inclined.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - Together...? Just the two of us?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Can you ride one on your own? Or do you plan to cling on behind me?
Happy - Heh... Whichever it is, you've got your work cut out for you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
In any case, you have my thanks. I'm feeling a lot better now.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru is expressing her appreciation.
I feel like our relationship has grown...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - You know, I have to wonder...
Happy - When my parents went through stressful times, maybe they had moments like this too.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sorry, I know this isn't the proper place to stand around chatting.
But if it's all right with you... why don't we stay here a bit longer before heading back?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I passed some time with Mitsuru,
then headed back to the dorm.

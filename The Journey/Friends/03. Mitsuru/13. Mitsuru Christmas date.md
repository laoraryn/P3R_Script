Mitsuru Kirijo   
Are you ready, Arisato?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - You didn't invite anyone else, did you? Wait, what am I saying...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Sorry, I'm having some trouble remaining calm. I'll let you decide where we should go...

I decided to spend   
Christmas Eve with Mitsuru...   
   
===============================================================================================   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Oh, it's already gotten so late...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - When I'm with you, I sometimes find myself wishing for the clock to stop moving.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What a peculiar feeling. Could it be...?   
......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Um... Sorry. I was just talking to myself.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - It's nothing! Come on, don't look at me like that.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - You're going to see how flushed my face is...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ......   
Sad - This place is awfully bright...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Do you mind if we go somewhere else?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I spent time with Mitsuru until night fell.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What a sight...   
Happy - I thought I was accustomed to Christmas decorations by now...   
Happy - But for some reason, they look especially beautiful today.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Not as beautiful as you.   
So, what's next?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Er— Hey, don't tease me.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Er— You mean after this? Well...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What would you like to do?   
I would honestly be fine with anything...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Well, shall we stroll around for a bit?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Even a simple walk with you is quite pleasant.   
Happy - No manner of extravagant party could offer an experience like this.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Here. I'd like you to have something.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Received (Item name)   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I put in a special order for you.   
Happy - My hope is we take some time to enjoy it together, once things have settled down...   
Happy - I'm glad I was able to give this to you today. Thank you, Arisato.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - For once, I feel... calm. Like I'm finally at peace.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I should probably let you know...   
Sad - When I see you enjoying yourself with Yukari or the others, I get... restless.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
But at the same time, it's a pleasure to be reminded of these feelings I have.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - In all honesty... I never thought I'd be allowed to be this happy.   
Happy - ......   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I shared a tender moment with Mitsuru...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Minato...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...I just felt like saying your name.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It shouldn't be such a big deal, so...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Don't give me that look.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Minato... If you keep staring at me that way...   
......

I shared a special evening with Mitsuru.   
I feel an unbreakable bond between us...

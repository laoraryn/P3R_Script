   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
   
   
Thank you for your time   
   
I'm not quite used to sending messages this way, so I apologize in advance if I say something rude.   
Are you available after school today? If you've already made plans, I don't mind joining you either.   
Should you find that agreeable, come find me in the hallway on the first floor.   
   
-----   
   
Once again   
   
   
I'd like your help. Would you mind showing me another place again? Ideally, after school today.   
You can find me in the hallway on the first floor.   
   
-----   
   
If you have the time   
   
   
I won't ask you to take me somewhere to eat this time. In fact, I need your help and wisdom regarding a certain matter.   
Shall we head to the library together?   
I'll be waiting at the usual spot.   
   
-----   
   
I'd like to ask you a favor   
   
   
I apologize for the short notice, but there's a place I'd like to stop by on the way back. You seem familiar with the area, so I was hoping you could show me around.   
Come find me if you find that agreeable.   
   
-----   
   
Nothing important    
   
   
Yukari told me, "You sound so angry *sweatdrop*" and, "You're so stiff *sweatdrop*" in response to my messages, so I've been trying to use emojis. :) Is it working? :o   
I'm thinking of stopping by the library later. :) Would you care to join me?    
   
-----   
   
On the way home    
   
   
I'm surprised there's even an emoji for this.    
Shall we stop by somewhere again on the way back? If you have the time, that is.    
   
-----   
   
Another movie?   
   
   
I'm not trying to bring up your promise the other day as an excuse, but would you indulge me in another favor?   
I'd like to stop by the theater on the way home.   
You can find me at the usual place.   
   
-----   
   
(No Subject)   
   
   
I know I gave you some trouble the other day. It's been on my mind this whole time.   
Could we meet? I'd like to talk with you.   
   
-----   
   
(No Subject)   
   
   
I'm not sure how to express these feelings of mine... All I know is that you're responsible for making me this way.   
If you have the time, could you come see me?   
   
-----   
   
I'd like to apologize   
   
   
I would like a chance to apologize for the rude encounter the other day, as well as to inform you of the aftermath.   
May I have some of your time? Come look for me if that's all right with you.   
   
-----   
   
It's me :)   
   
   
It's as if there's no end to this cold weather.  Take care of yourself so as not to get sick.    
How does your schedule look? Could you accompany me somewhere today?   
I still can't get used to using emojis. *sweatdrop*   
   
-----   
   
Sorry to bother you   
   
   
Are you free today? I'd like for us to do something together.   
   
-----   
   
Sorry for the trouble   
   
   
I have some time to spare today. How about you?   
   
-----   
   
Are you busy?   
   
   
If you have time, let's do something together. I'll be waiting for you after school.   
   
-----   
   
Let's go somewhere   
   
   
We rarely ever get a day off, so it doesn't feel right to shut ourselves inside the dorm.   
I don't plan on going somewhere far. Would you care to join me?   
   
-----   
   
Shall we watch a movie?   
   
   
Apologies for the sudden invitation, but would you like to watch a movie with me?   
I'd rather not go alone so we could discuss it afterwards.   
I believe it will help broaden your perspective—if you have the time.   
Come find me if you'd like to go.   
   
-----   
   
Student council   
   
   
How's your progress? Have you spoken with Ms. Toriumi about joining the student council?   
If not, you should be able to find her in the **faculty office** after school.   
I look forward to you joining.   
   
-----   
   
Student council   
   
   
Congratulations on joining the student council. Now you'll be permitted to enter the **student council room** for meetings.   
Today is one such day where we meet. I look forward to seeing you there.   
   
-----   
   
Are you free tonight?   
   
   
Naganaki Shrine is hosting a summer festival tonight.   
I was planning on taking Aigis there to show her around, but I'm not certain if I'd make a good guide.   
If it's not too much trouble, could you come along as well?   
   
-----   
   
Merry Christmas   
   
   
I've never thought of spending Christmas together with someone before... But then I met you.   
Today, I want it to be just the two of us.   
I'll be waiting for your response.   
   
-----   
   
Can we talk?   
   
   
There's a personal matter I'd like to discuss with you. Could you hear me out?   
But you must keep this a secret from the others.   
Let's talk in school. You can find me in the first-floor hallway.   
   
-----   
   
I'd like some assistance   
   
   
As I've mentioned before, there's something I'd like to discuss with you.   
I know you're not personally involved, but I'd appreciate your assistance.   
Come find me whenever you have time.   
   
-----   
   
Can I ask you a favor?   
   
   
It concerns Amada.   
He seems to be keeping to himself inside his room these days. You can also hear noises coming from his room at night...   
Could you check in on him? It seems he respects you a lot.   
   
-----   
   
About Amada   
   
   
Have you been able to talk to him? I would really appreciate it if you did.   
It seems like he's holed up in his room again today...   
I'm counting on you.   
   
-----   
   
About Aragaki   
   
   
Have you heard anything from Aragaki about returning to school?   
I suppose it'd be best not to get our hopes up, but I'd still like to know how things are going.   
Can we meet to talk about it?   
   
-----   
   
Do you have time right now?   
   
   
I'd like an update regarding the matter with Aragaki. Could you come talk to me when you're free?   
   
-----   
   
Just letting you know   
   
   
I'll be on the second floor today. Come let me know if you want to go to Tartarus.   
   
-----   
   
Just letting you know   
   
   
I'll be on the third floor today. If you want to go to Tartarus, come find me.   
   
-----   
   
For your information   
   
   
I'll be in the command room today. If you want to go to Tartarus, come and let me know. I'll be able to join you as well.   
   
-----   
   
About the girl from last night   
   
   
Good morning.   
The hospital notified us earlier today that her condition has stabilized.   
For now, Akihiko and I will handle questioning her. You should just go about your usual routine.   
   
-----   
   
Regarding that matter   
   
   
Have you delivered the form to Aragaki?   
If you haven't, then you should be able to find him at **the back alley on Port Island**.   
Thank you for doing this.

I already gave her Aragaki's leave

Should I try talking to Aragaki again?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I was asked to deliver the school   
reinstatement form to Aragaki.   
He's usually in the back alley near the   
station. Should I go look for him there?

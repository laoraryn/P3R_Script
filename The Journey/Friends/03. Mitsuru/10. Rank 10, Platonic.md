The battery and tire pressure look good... And I've already changed the oil, so that's fine.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Impressive.
Looks like fun.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Well, this is just basic maintenance. Anyone could do the same.
Happy - Though if I start tinkering with the suspension and whatnot, there'd be no end to it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Indeed—maintaining and customizing a motorcycle is almost as enjoyable as riding it.
Happy - Though if I start tinkering with the suspension and whatnot, there'd be no end to it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - There have been days I've lost track of time doing this, and had to run into meetings covered in oil...
Happy - It seems I'm the type of person who can fall very deep into things. I'll have to be more careful.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, by the way—the matter involving my ex-fiancé was resolved sooner than I expected.
They ended up reaching out to us about a potential business arrangement. Without any of the marriage talks, of course.
We managed to negotiate some favorable terms, so that should put the company back on track.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I could have decided to burn that bridge, but I'd prefer not to shut down a genuine attempt to compromise.
Happy - It may be thanks to you that I've become so open-minded.

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right, before we head out... I had a small gift for you, since you've done so much for me.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It's the key to my motorcycle.
I'm not going to run from my future anymore. Rather... there's no longer any need to.
This motorcycle isn't meant to be an escape from my feelings.
Happy - It's a dear friend that gives me the freedom to go wherever I please.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Once I realized that, I felt that I absolutely had to show it to you.
Happy - As our leader, I think it would be quite fitting if you had the skill to ride my dear friend here.
Happy - When this is all over, let's take this motorcycle and go on a trip somewhere together.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Great idea.
If I feel like it.
I don't have a license.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Isn't it? We'll have to start thinking about where we want to go.
Happy - I look forward to the day you learn how to ride it yourself.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Heh, no rush. Let me know when the mood strikes you.
I'll be thinking about where we should go in the meantime, and I won't let life get in the way of it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Heh, I'm sure you won't have any trouble getting one.
Happy - I can even coach you, if you'd like. I'm fairly confident in my skills.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Once we go on that trip, I imagine it'll be full of things I've still yet to see.
Happy - You were the one who taught me the joy of new discoveries. I can hardly wait.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru seems to respect me
deeply as a friend she can trust...

The Empress Social Link reached its maximum level! You can now fuse **Alilat**, the ancient goddess!

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right, I think we've talked enough. Today, it's my turn to show you something new.
Go ahead and sit on the back.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Don't worry, it's just a short drive. I even prepared a helmet for you.
Happy - The weather is perfect today... The view from the Moonlight Bridge is quite a sight to see, you know.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Here goes. Hold on tight!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We rode around the city, then
returned to the dorm...

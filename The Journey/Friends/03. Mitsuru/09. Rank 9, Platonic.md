Mitsuru Kirijo
Go on and have a seat.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Um... I know what you're thinking.

Minato Arisato - Selection
This room is... Wow.
No fair.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Yukari always tells me it's like having a second lounge.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Haha, my apologies. I admit, it's a tad excessive.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Our maid staff assisted with the furnishings... That's the reason it looks like this.
Although... maybe I shouldn't be making excuses.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Up until now, I held strong to the idea that I must live by the honor of the Kirijo name.
But despite how occupied I should have been with the family business, I always found time to spend with you.
Sad - It made me realize I'd been running away this whole time... Running from the truth of what I really wanted.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Now that the engagement's broken off, it's been complete chaos around me.
But I know we can make it through this.
Some are calling me a spoiled brat who's ruining everything... But beyond that are many others showing their support.
It's been a much-needed reminder that I'm not alone.

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's a relief.
Never let go of that.
This is your strength.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Right... I apologize for worrying you. I couldn't have done this without you paving the way.
Happy - Allow me to thank you on behalf of the Group. I'm certain my father would feel the same way.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I won't. It's those people who are my strength... and the strength of the Kirijo family.
Happy - I never would have realized this if I didn't have you as a friend.

Mitsuru Kirijo
No... I gained that strength thanks to you.
If you hadn't opened my eyes, I very well could have turned out as contemptible as my ex-fiancé.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Ever since we met, my life has been full of new experiences.
Happy - You're always showing me sides of this world that I've never seen before.
The memories we've made—fighting side-by-side, exploring the city, or even just passing the hours talking—I'll treasure them forever.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Treating you to a cup of tea here is hardly going to repay you for everything you've done for me.
But think of it as my pledge to give you my full support from now on.
I'll do whatever I can to make sure that happens.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru's gratitude and resolve is clear...
I feel like our relationship has grown...

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right, I'm going to call Yukari and the others. Settle down and make yourself comfortable.
Happy - I should warn you, there's no telling how long we can talk over tea and snacks. I hope you're prepared.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We all chatted as the hours flew by...

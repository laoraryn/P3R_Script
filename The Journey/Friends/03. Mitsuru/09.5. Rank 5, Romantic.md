Mitsuru Kirijo
All right... I don't think anyone will come up here for a while.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I leveraged my position on the student council to make it happen.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - This is, um, the first time I've ever used my authority for personal reasons...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Exasperated* - Wait, that's not important right now.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - What am I doing...?

Mitsuru Kirijo
What I'm trying to say is, we need to talk.
Firstly, I have to apologize...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I'm sorry for what happened last time.

Minato Arisato - Selection
What happened?
Don't worry about it.
It made me happy.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - You know... The other day, in front of the station...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, I see. You're pretending it was nothing to spare me the embarrassment.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I don't know what's wrong with me...

Mitsuru Kirijo
That's... kind of you. Thank you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
The things my ex-fiancé said to you were inexcusable, but more importantly...
Sad - I wanted to apologize for my own behavior.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - ...!
Happy - Oh, so it did...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - When that happened, um...
Sad - I said all manner of things about you. And then I just... ran off.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - That was unbelievably insensitive of me. I'm sorry.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I had been planning on telling you my feelings...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Exasperated* - I just didn't think I'd end up shouting them in public like that.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Talk about bold.
Your feelings?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hey, don't tease me like that! I didn't think I had it in me either...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Ever since I started spending time with you, my life has been full of new experiences.
Sad - I've felt shock, joy, even outrage... But every time, I've always been thinking of you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - Wha!? Well, I mean, um...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Ever since I started spending time with you, my life has been full of new experiences.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I've felt shock, joy, even outrage... But every time, I've always been thinking of you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - ......

Mitsuru Kirijo
Now that it's come to this, I'm obligated to tell you exactly how I feel.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Here goes. I...

Mitsuru Kirijo
I... love you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - ......

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru's voice is trembling. I'd better
choose my words carefully...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Come to think of it, **I have a special**
**relationship with another person already**...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - ...I feel like I'm going to die of embarrassment.

Minato Arisato - Selection
I love you too.
I'm sorry, but...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - ...!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Y-You... love me too...?
Sad - ......

Mitsuru Kirijo
I... I'm so happy to hear that. Or should I say... I'm thankful?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Ngh, my heart... At this rate, it's going to end up like last time...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - It really is wonderful, though... To know that the feeling is mutual.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Heh, I'm glad I managed to open my heart. As of today, you're more than just a friend to me.
Happy - That said, given my situation, I can't go public about this just yet.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can sense Mitsuru's deep affection for me.
Things seem to be getting serious...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
There's no going back now...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Say, Arisato...
I've been thinking about this for a while now, but the way you address me...

Minato Arisato - Selection
"Mitsuru"?
What about it?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Er— That's exactly what I mean!
Sad - You're on a first-name basis with me, while I've been sticking to formalities... It's a bit unbalanced.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - Er— Don't act like you don't know!
You're on a first-name basis with me, while I've been sticking to formalities... It's a bit unbalanced.

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right, I've decided.
From now on, when it's just the two of us, I'll call you by your first name.
It's going to be a bit awkward for me, but trust that this is what I want.

Mitsuru Kirijo
In any case, today marks a change. I'm not going to let myself be constrained by my family heritage.
It's because of who I am as an individual that I ended up meeting you...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Er— Look at all these things you're making me say. You'd better take responsibility for this!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Ah... Minato... Well, this is a start...
Happy - Don't let go just yet...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We spent some more time together,
and then returned to the dorm...

Mitsuru Kirijo
...I see.
Happy - That's unfortunate, but I'm glad I cleared the air.

Mitsuru Kirijo
You told me it was up to me how to handle these emotions. Thanks to that, I was able to be honest with myself.
If I had kept my feelings locked up, I never would have been able to move forward...
Happy - It is imperative to be true to our hearts... Just as you were with your answer.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Thank you, Arisato.
If I hadn't harbored these emotions, I would have continued lying to myself, justifying it all under the Kirijo name.
And if that had happened... there's no doubt I would have failed on my path in the future.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - From now on, I'm not going to let myself be constrained by my family heritage.
Happy - It's because of who I am as an individual that I ended up meeting you.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can sense Mitsuru's deep trust.
I feel like our relationship has grown...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Now then... I certainly have a lot to thank you for, but there's one more matter I'd like to bring up.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I haven't eaten since this morning, so I'm terribly famished. I'd say you bear some responsibility for this.
Happy - I could do with some takoyaki on our way back. Your treat?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I'd hardly complain if you were to do at least that much to mend a broken heart...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We stopped by the strip mall
and then returned to the dorm...

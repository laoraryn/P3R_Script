Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, it's you. Do you have some time to spare right now?
The company heads gifted me some quality tea leaves. I'd be happy to serve you a cup.
In order to better appreciate the tea blend, it's better to brew enough for two, you see.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, it's you. Do you have some time to spare right now?
Happy - Now that the kitchen has been cleaned up, I was considering putting it to use.
Happy - I happen to have some quality tea leaves from the company heads. I'd be happy to serve you a cup.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, it's you. Do you have some time to spare right now?
Happy - I happen to have some quality tea leaves from the company heads. I'd like to serve you a cup.

Mitsuru Kirijo
There are only five more days until the next full moon... So think of this as a little stress reliever.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru asked me to join her for tea.
Should I spend some time with Mitsuru?

Mitsuru Kirijo
What do you say?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure, let's have tea.
No, thank you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
If you have the time, would you care to join me for some tea again?
I'd like to brew a different blend this time. It also happens to be one of my favorites.

Mitsuru Kirijo
There's going to be a full moon soon... Though I doubt you're nervous about it at all.
If you'd like, we could have tea together. I've prepared a different blend from last time.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru asked me to join her for tea.
Should I spend some time with Mitsuru?

Mitsuru Kirijo
If you don't mind, I'd like you to join me for a cup.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure, I'll have some tea.
I'm a bit busy today...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Ah, Arisato. If you're free, why don't you join me for some tea?
I'm planning to change things up this time.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, Arisato. If you're available, how about joining me for some tea?
Happy - With our next battle coming up, it wouldn't be such a bad idea to relax a bit, don't you agree?
I'm planning to change things up this time.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can sense Mitsuru's quiet determination.
Mitsuru might gain a new ability soon...
Should I spend some time with Mitsuru?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Before I start brewing the tea, there's something I want to do. Would you like to join me?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure, I'd love some tea.
I'll think about it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'm thinking of taking a break from everything... A cup of tea would be nice.
Would you like to join me?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It doesn't seem like Mitsuru will gain any more
new skills even if we spend time together.

Mitsuru Kirijo
If we have any leftovers again, they're all yours. What do you say?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'd love to, madam.
No, thank you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Wonderful. I'll start the preparation.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - All right. Then let's head to the kitchen.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...Very well.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh? Did you want to have some tea after all?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It doesn't seem like Mitsuru will gain any more
new skills even if we spend time together.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I spend some time with Mitsuru?

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'll pour you a cup if you have the time.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Please and thank you.
Not now.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Why don't we try adding some spice today?
Go ahead and blend it however you like.

Internal MES - MND_001_0_0
I enjoyed brewing tea with Mitsuru...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I always find this to be so relaxing... I suppose you could call it a moment of bliss.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Let me know whenever you're in the mood for more tea. I'd be happy to treat you.

-----

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Help yourself to the snacks as well, if you'd like.
Happy - Today, I wanted to show my thanks for your hard work, as well as check in to see how you're doing.
Ever since you joined us, you've been taking on a lot of responsibility as leader of our group.
Have you been running into any trouble? If you have, please, don't be afraid to let me know.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Not really.
A little, I guess...
Does it have to be now?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - ...Well, that's good to hear.
Happy - I have to say, I'm always inspired by the way you remain calm no matter the situation.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I apologize for putting so much pressure on you. I'll do whatever I can to help.
I have to say, I am grateful that you agreed to take on the leadership role.
And I want you to know that you're doing an excellent job. Akihiko was right about you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Well, I won't force you or anything...
I just thought that this time we have might be a good opportunity to talk things over.
But I suppose it's only natural for you to have your own problems. For today, let's enjoy the refreshments.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Your cup is empty... Let's pour you another.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru and I enjoyed tea together...

Mitsuru Kirijo
...It's late. We ended up spending a lot of time here.
Let's turn in for the night.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Oh, I'll take care of the cleanup.
Happy - I'm glad we had the chance to talk today. I'd like to invite you again when the opportunity arises.
Then with that, I bid you a good night.

-----

Mitsuru Kirijo
It feels nice, being able to pour tea for someone else like this...
Happy - Oh, my apologies.
Happy - I'm supposed to be the host, and yet here I am thinking about myself.
How about you, then? Are you having a good time?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Of course.
I'm a bit tense.
I'd like a refill...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Oh, that's good to hear.
Happy - Chamomile is known for its relaxing properties, so maybe that's taking its effect on you.
Sad - I... was actually a bit worried that I might be putting you off.
Sad - Apparently, the popular opinion is that I'm difficult to approach...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sorry about that. Try to relax, if you can...
Then again, if it were that easy, it wouldn't be a problem, would it?
Sad - Apparently, the popular opinion is that I'm difficult to approach...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - My apologies. Let me take care of that for you.
Happy - Heh, I'm glad you aren't afraid to speak up when you want something.
Apparently, the popular opinion is that I'm difficult to approach...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hm? We're running low on snacks. I'll have to ask my staff to—

Actually...
Oh, never mind. Here, let me pour you another cup.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I drank herbal tea with Mitsuru as
we discussed our favorite snacks...

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right, I think that's enough for now. We should start cleaning up.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I'd like to invite you for this again, if time allows.
But for now, let's head back to our rooms.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Today, I'd like to make a snack food that would pair well with tea.
Happy - That said, I'm not terribly well-versed in the art of cuisine.
So, I'm hoping to make some simple karume-yaki. Did your teachers ever show you how to make it?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I think so.
I don't remember.
Karume-what?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Excellent. Then I don't need to explain.
All right, let's get started.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Well, you take baking soda—also known as sodium bicarbonate—and when it undergoes thermal decomposition...
Actually, it would be faster to show you while we work. Let's get started.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Karume-yaki is a confectionary that was passed down from Portugal during the Sengoku period.
"Karume" derives from the Portuguese word "caramelo," or "caramel" in English...
Happy - Well, it might be faster if you just see for yourself. Let's get started.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Temperature control is key. We want to turn off the heat right before it hits 130 degrees Celsius...
Surprised - Oh, we should keep things moving. Let's put the sugar in the ladle first...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I cooked karume-yaki with Mitsuru.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - What a nostalgic flavor.
It may not require hours in the kitchen, and the taste isn't particularly complex...
But I'm quite fond of these. And more than anything, it's nice that we can make it ourselves.

Mitsuru Kirijo
You know... when I saw this for the first time, I thought it was like magic.
I've tried making it myself a number of times, but I ended up burning it on every attempt.
Happy - I guess you could call it a bittersweet memory. But I didn't give up—I continued practicing.

Mitsuru Kirijo
And that's finally led to our success today. What do you think?

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's so inspiring.
Not much of a cook?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Hearing you say that makes me glad to have shared it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - You didn't know?
In any case, now that I've grasped how to do it, I won't forget so easily.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Back home, there were plenty of opportunities to host formal dinners and tea parties...
But I never considered it particularly admirable to have someone else prepare the extravagant dishes.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Doing the cooking myself also allows me to talk with you like this.
Happy - And isn't that sort of familiarity the key to understanding each other better?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I think... this might have been what I was missing.
Instead of complaining about being difficult to approach, I needed to create an opportunity for change.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
By cooking this nostalgic dish,
Mitsuru seems to have learned
something new about herself...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - It's fascinating, the kind of things you learn by simply inviting someone over for tea.
Thank you, Arisato. I hope we can talk again like this sometime.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, right. I had a favor to ask.
There's still some sugar and baking soda left. Do you think you could help me make another batch?
Happy - Karume-yaki keeps for a long time. This could be a good chance to make some for the others.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After making karume-yaki with
Mitsuru, I went back to my room.

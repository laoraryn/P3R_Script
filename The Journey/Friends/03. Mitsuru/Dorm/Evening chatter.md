Mitsuru Kirijo
It's dangerous to go out on your own at night. Please refrain from doing so.
Happy - Besides, you must be tired after today. You should make sure to get a good night's rest.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I must say, the moon looks quite stunning on this hazy spring night.
Happy - Though tempting as it may be to spend a night such as this gazing at the sky...
...I suggest you head to bed early and get some rest. Don't worry, there will be more full moons.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Well, Akihiko seems to be his usual self. But that doesn't mean he isn't helpful, of course.
Incidentally, what are you doing here?
This is the girls' floor. If you don't have a particular reason to be here, go back downstairs.

Mitsuru Kirijo
You may go out at night, but please use the appropriate discretion with this privilege.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Tartarus—riddled with mysteries as it is—will no doubt challenge you with unexpected encounters.
If you ever feel outmatched, there is no shame in a wise retreat.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Detection ability is crucial for exploring Tartarus efficiently.
I've been training my own such ability, but it will take more work still before I am fully competent.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Generally speaking, you may do whatever you like on your days off.
Happy - You can stay in and study or go out and enjoy yourself. It's up to you.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Cool, thanks.
What do you do on days off?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Just don't do anything reckless.

Mitsuru Kirijo
More often than not, I'll be in the dorm.
Happy - I tend to feel more at ease keeping to my books rather than gallivanting outdoors.

Mitsuru Kirijo
A piece of advice for fighting in Tartarus...
To get the upper hand in combat, I suggest attacking Shadows from their blind spot.
You will have the advantage if you can launch a preemptive strike without being noticed.
Try to utilize this technique often.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - As president of the student council, I'm really quite busy.
Happy - In fact, it's quite rare that I have any time to rest.
I won't require your help constantly, but stop by the student council room when you have time.
I'll look forward to your contributions.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Online games...? Well, some casual recreation is fine, but try not to get carried away.
Happy - If it should devolve into an unhealthy obsession... Need I say the rest?

Mitsuru Kirijo
The higher we advance up Tartarus, the stronger our enemies will become.
Do you feel that your current equipment is adequate?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, I think so.
I'm not so sure.

Mitsuru Kirijo
That's good to hear. Just don't get careless.
You should consider paying Officer Kurosawa a visit when you have the time.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Officer Kurosawa sells equipment.
You should go see him when you have the time.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Well, remember that Officer Kurosawa sells equipment.
You should pay him a visit when you have the time.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Akihiko is still having some tests done. He should be back tomorrow, though.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Our school's exams tend to be difficult, but you'll be fine as long as you're diligent about studying.
That said, you just transferred and then were hospitalized for a time...
Happy - I'll see what I can do to help you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Akihiko's injuries will need some more time to fully heal.
Will you be able to continue fighting with only three members until he returns?

Minato Arisato - Selection
No problem!
I don't know...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - *chuckle* Your confidence is commendable. I wish you the best of luck.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I see... I suppose you'll have to do your best to adjust for the time being.
Happy - I know you can do it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I'll be counting on you all until Akihiko recovers. I have every confidence that you'll manage.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Were you looking for me? I'm training my Persona's ability to detect enemies.
I can't say for certain that a large enemy like the one from last month won't attack again.
There's no excuse for being unprepared. We can't afford to let ourselves get caught off guard.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Did you have a productive Golden Week?
As for myself, I generally stuck to the same routine I follow every Golden Week.
Although I did keep a close eye on Akihiko to dissuade him from trying anything reckless.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - *sigh* Akihiko... What is he thinking, suggesting that?
Clearly, it's high time I reestablished some ground rules.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'll need to further improve my detection ability to pick up on less conspicuous abnormalities...
I'll do my best, but this will likely take some time.
Sad - In lieu of being able to fully rely on my abilities, try to prepare for all contingencies.

Mitsuru Kirijo
You've been here for a little over a month now.
I know it hasn't exactly been an ordinary experience, but generally, how are you faring?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Great!
I'm overwhelmed.
I'm exhausted...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I'm glad to hear it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - That's to be expected.
Happy - You're leading quite an unusual school life, after all.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - *chuckle* I appreciate your honesty. But yes, I certainly understand.
However, we have an important job to do.
I'm sure, when all is said and done, you'll be able to come away with more than just exhaustion.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I'm sure your experiences here will prove useful for you, in some way or another.
Happy - Well, keep up the good work.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - It was my own incompetence during the operation that led to a difficult situation.
Sad - I'm sorry...

Minato Arisato - Selection
No need to apologize.
We'll do better next time.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - That's very kind of you.
But, even if you forgive me, I don't think I can forgive myself.
Should another situation like this arise in the future, I promise I will be stronger by then.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Yes...
If there is indeed a next time... I promise to be stronger by then.

Mitsuru Kirijo
The general public considers the monorail incident an accident caused by human error.
Sad - The public will likely pin it on the operating company for being negligent.
Sad - It's unfortunate, but it would be unrealistic to ask that blame be put on the Shadow at fault.

Mitsuru Kirijo
There seems to be something wrong with some of the equipment in the command room.
Could I bother you to check on it?
Sad - Akihiko and Iori didn't appear interested in solving the matter.
I won't force you, but if you're not too busy, I would appreciate it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
You need an extremely high level of concentration to summon a Persona.
So, if an enemy is able to confuse you in battle, you won't be able to use your Persona.
Some of the more intelligent enemies will try to use this tactic...
So be on your guard.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It's good to be motivated when it comes to SEES, but remember that we're students first.
With that in mind, be sure to keep up with your studies.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Needless to say, all of us have experienced fear at some point in our lives...
But in Tartarus, certain enemies can forcibly inflict it upon us.
This "fear" may render one immobile in battle, while others may attempt to flee altogether.
Once afflicted, your volition will be all but defunct, so keep your guard up.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'd like you to hold off on going to Tartarus today and tomorrow. Would that be all right with you?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, all right.
Why?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I'm glad we're on the same page. Please use this time to study for the exams.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Everyone is busy studying for the exams and may not have time to go.
For this weekend, I'd like you to put Tartarus out of your mind and focus on your studies.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It certainly gets quiet in the dorm right before exams.
This unusual silence may make for a good time to train my Persona's detection abilities...
Happy - Well... "silence" aside from Iori's screaming, that is.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - We were very lucky to find another Persona-user...
However, it can't be helped if she's unwilling or unable to fully participate.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Come to think of it, the chairman mentioned he had some business with you.
Have you spoken with him yet?
If not, I'd like you to as soon as you have the time.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Whenever I look up at Tartarus, I'm always amazed at how many floors it seems to have.
The tower reaches to the skies...
Sad - *sigh* It's going to be a long and arduous journey...

Mitsuru Kirijo
The equipment in the command room still seems to be malfunctioning.
I don't know the details, but it appears to be the cause of some unidentifiable error.
Sad - If you have time to examine it, I'd appreciate it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'm sorry, but I'm in the middle of training my Persona to search for enemies.
The others appear to be busy as well...
If you were planning on going to Tartarus, perhaps it would be better to go another night instead.

Mitsuru Kirijo
This incident is quite troubling. As the student council president, I need to do something.
Sad - Though it doesn't help that I have no idea what's really going on...

Mitsuru Kirijo
If Takeba won't go to Tartarus tonight, perhaps it would be better to go when everyone can join us.
Though I have to admit I'm a bit curious about these supposed "hauntings"...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - It is difficult for me to believe that the incident was caused by ghosts...
However, we are currently at a lack of a more logical explanation.
So it may be worth looking into. Please let me know if you come across any useful information.

Mitsuru Kirijo
How is your research into the ghost story progressing?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Great!
We're missing something...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - C'est magnifique! Keep up the good work.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Well, I can see why it would be difficult to ascertain the truth in such a situation.
Happy - But don't let yourself be discouraged.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I'm impressed that you've been able to gather so much information in such a short amount of time.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Yamagishi has disappeared...
Sad - It began with a ghost story, but it has developed into a serious situation.
Sad - We have to do something...

Mitsuru Kirijo
I apologize for not being able to go to Tartarus multiple days in a row.
Preparing for Yamagishi's move has taken longer than I anticipated.
...In any case, this floor is reserved for the girls' rooms.
Males are not permitted. Please return downstairs.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hm? Mr. Ekoda's punishment?
Well, there are some things in life you don't want to know about...
Happy - This is one of them.

Mitsuru Kirijo
My weapon of choice is the thrusting sword.
It was once used to settle duels in Europe.
Its power and accuracy may be average, but it's a reliable weapon with no particular downsides.
Happy - I, personally, do not like to gamble with the effectiveness of my weapon, so it's ideal for me.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It seems certain clubs have begun actively recruiting new members.
Oh, but you're already in a club, aren't you?
Well, there's no rule against joining multiple clubs. Feel free to join any that pique your interest.
Juggling studies, club activities, and Shadows won't be easy, but it'd surely build character.

Mitsuru Kirijo
While we can't slack on our exploration of Tartarus if we want to solve its mysteries...
It's important to rest and take time for yourself as well.
You're free to go out or spend time with the others in the dorm. Just don't stay up too late.

Mitsuru Kirijo
......
Sad - I'm thinking right now. If you're looking for someone to talk to, please find someone else.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Our abilities are quite inexplicable...
Not just anyone can acquire them, and we're still unaware of what exactly triggers an awakening...
Happy - And yet, we would be quite lost without our abilities, wouldn't we?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I wonder where Akihiko is...
If he's going to be late, he should at least have the courtesy to call me.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Even though there's time until the next full moon, we had best use that time wisely.
Of course, training in Tartarus is one way to prepare.
Happy - Whenever you are inclined to do so, do not hesitate to ask me to join you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - This is one of the chairman's indulgences. As to whether his jokes are actually humorous or not...
Well... It would be quite boorish of us to make such comments on the matter to his face.
You'll simply have to get used to it. Just try to ignore him if it gets to be too much.

Mitsuru Kirijo
There will be a full moon in a week. You do understand what that means, yes?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I know.
I forget...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Good. Then make sure you're adequately prepared.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It seems powerful Shadows appear on nights with full moons.
Happy - In other words, you'll want to make sure your preparations are in order ahead of time.

Mitsuru Kirijo
One week remains until the next full moon.
Happy - You'll want to be ready for the upcoming battle.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - As you may recall, I handled support before Yamagishi joined us, so I was worried my sword skills might have deteriorated...
Happy - However, muscle memory kicked in and I seem to be as capable as ever.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It appears that the number of the Lost is increasing again.
This time, however, it seems many of the new cases specifically involve couples.
Hm... Perhaps who the Shadows target is dictated by the time of year.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I don't mind if you go out, but remember that we'll be facing a Shadow soon.
Try not to expend yourself too much beforehand.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I suppose we'll soon see if his hypothesis is correct...
If it is, the next Shadow will appear tomorrow. Best be prepared.

Mitsuru Kirijo
With each full moon, the Shadows that appear get stronger.
But why full moons? Each question simply begets more questions...

Mitsuru Kirijo
It's fine to reflect on your victory...
But don't forget that there are exams next week as well.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I didn't mean to hide anything.
I simply told you what you needed to know, and omitted the details I deemed unnecessary...
Sad - But I should stop making excuses...
Sad - Regardless of my reasons, there's no denying that I kept some information secret...
Sad - I... I was hiding it...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Have you made all your preparations for Yakushima?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'm ready!
I'll start getting ready soon.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - Oh? You had adequate spare time during finals, did you?
Happy - Well, as long as you did well on them.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Well, we're leaving the day after tomorrow, early in the morning. Make sure you're ready by then.

Mitsuru Kirijo
We're leaving early the day after tomorrow, so be sure to get some rest tomorrow night.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hm, an anti-Shadow weapon... That will be a most welcome addition.
Most souvenirs are useless. Snow globes, keychains, postcards...
Happy - However, this souvenir from Yakushima is très bien.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It must be difficult for you to balance combat and studies. I should do more to help you all.
Perhaps summer school would be beneficial... Well, let's wait and see how the others did.

Mitsuru Kirijo
He'll be staying at the dorm, but remember, he's not a member of SEES.
So be very careful what you say around him.
And don't talk with him about anything regarding Shadows.

Mitsuru Kirijo
We've been very busy this month...
As a result, I'm not sure that we've been going to Tartarus often enough.
Please make sure you're prepared for the next full moon.

Mitsuru Kirijo
The veterinarian told me that Koromaru is in stable condition.
The wound was severe, but, fortunately, there wasn't any damage to his internal organs.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Mastery of both academic obligations and combat is no mean feat.
Happy - And yet you continue to deliver. Keep up the good work.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I thought you'd like to know: Koromaru's condition seems to be improving.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Glad to hear it.
I'm still a little worried.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Yes. He may have a diminutive figure, but he's a fighter.
We would do well to learn from his example and stay vigilant in our own endeavors.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Don't worry, he'll be all right. Try to focus on the Shadows for now.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Tomorrow night, during the Dark Hour, we will battle a new Shadow.
You won't be able to go to Tartarus between now and then...
But you should still prepare your items and equipment.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I didn't expect to meet Persona-users outside of ourselves and those we've located and recruited.
Not to mention ones filled with malice and hostility...
As if we haven't been busy enough keeping the Shadows at bay...

Mitsuru Kirijo
It must be easier taking Koromaru on walks with the nights being cool this time of year.
Happy - Dogs can't regulate their body heat by sweating, you see. So remember to keep an eye on him.

Mitsuru Kirijo
You may want to consider attending the summer festival at the shrine.
I don't think I'll be making a point to go myself, however.
I don't particularly enjoy crowded venues.

Aigis
I contend with that assertion. It would be more advantageous to deploy together.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - ......

Mitsuru Kirijo
I've been thinking about what we feed Koromaru...
We typically give him standard dog food, but do you think we should add some variety?
Happy - I imagine he'd get bored of eating the same meal every day, after all.
There is the option of preparing something by hand... But for now, I'll simply buy different food.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Your summer break next year will likely be inundated with studying for entrance exams, so make use of this free time while you have it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
This dorm was built some time ago, so the air conditioning unit doesn't work very well.
Sad - It's usually tolerable, but today... I can understand why Iori is griping so much.

Mitsuru Kirijo
One of the members of Strega seems to have taken an interest in you.
Sometimes, a malicious human being can be more dangerous than a Shadow.
If you should cross paths, I want you to be careful.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It's all over the news...
Apathy Syndrome cases are increasing.
We must do something about this...

Mitsuru Kirijo
I hate to say this, but the number of the Lost is increasing again.
You'll want to start getting ready for the next battle.
Happy - Now that Koromaru's joined us, you may want to consider devising some new tactics.

Mitsuru Kirijo
There's going to be a full moon soon after vacation ends.
Prepare yourself for it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - He seems very determined... Normally, I would think he would be a great addition to SEES.
His age worries me, though...
We will need to keep a close eye on him.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'm sure you're aware, but we won't be able to use air conditioning during the Dark Hour.
That means we'll also be dealing with heat in the upcoming battle.
See to it that you stay hydrated.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I recommended Aigis's attendance at school to the chairman.
Aigis requested that she attend and I couldn't think of any reason why she shouldn't.
The chairman agreed, so there you have it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I truly am glad to have you back, Aragaki.
But admittedly, I'm curious as to what motivated you to pick up your Evoker once again...
Happy - Something must have affected you profoundly.
Happy - I won't pry, however.

Shinjiro Aragaki
I appreciate that.
Maybe I'll be in the mood to tell you someday...

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'd appreciate it if you didn't probe Aragaki about the past too much...
Aragaki, Akihiko, and I were all in SEES when we were in middle school.
A lot of things happened back then...
Happy - But there's no need to doubt Aragaki. I assure you that he's reliable.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Why is Iori so excited about tomorrow?
There's going to be a full moon tomorrow, and with it, another powerful Shadow to fight.
I hardly think that's the kind of thing to be excited about...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Aragaki's suppressant, and Akihiko's expression...
Sad - ......

Mitsuru Kirijo
I hope you're getting along with Aragaki.
He's a little rough around the edges...
Happy - But, deep down, he's really a nice guy. Just give him a chance.

Mitsuru Kirijo
The typhoon threatens to cancel the festival...
It's a shame. As student council president, I have invested a lot of time into organizing it.
I hope we'll still be able to hold the festival, but...
I suppose all we can do is trust in providence.

Mitsuru Kirijo
The number of the Lost surges every full moon. It's relentlessly unceasing...
I hope we'll discover some breakthrough by climbing Tartarus...

Mitsuru Kirijo
As student council president, I am saddened to hear the festival has been canceled.
I suggested that the date be rescheduled, but it seems that won't happen.
Well, there is nothing one can do to hinder Mother Nature's will.

Mitsuru Kirijo
How are you feeling?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'm doing all right.
Not so great.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'm glad to hear it.
Happy - Then you'll have no problems going to Tartarus, I take it?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Then you should rest a little while longer.
It was enough having to deal with Akihiko's recklessness to the point of injury...

Mitsuru Kirijo
The news has been reporting that the number of the Lost is increasing again.
I wish we could receive some good news for once...

Mitsuru Kirijo
I realize this is after the fact, but are you at all disappointed the culture festival was canceled?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Of course.
Not really.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I see...
A great number of people have voiced their disappointment regarding the cancellation.
However, the decision is final. We will not be having a festival this year.
You will have to wait until next year to attend the culture festival.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, I see. Never mind, then.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I think it's unfortunate that you all missed out on the culture festival this year.
Well, I suppose the current second-years will have to make up for it next year.

Mitsuru Kirijo
The moon will be full again soon...
The end is near, but don't get nervous.
Just prepare for victory.

Mitsuru Kirijo
This next battle is going to be difficult. If you are not prepared, defeat is probable.
It's not necessary to be hypervigilant at all times, but do be proactive in your preparations.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Akihiko's right. Amada must decide what is best for himself.
It is a difficult decision for such a young person to make, but I'm not worried.
Amada has a strong will...
Happy - I am confident he will make the right choice.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It seems I appraised him accurately. He has the soul of a warrior.
Happy - I admire his fortitude.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - He gave his life to save another... How noble...
I'd like to think that I could do the same, if it came down to it. How about you?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure, why not?
I'd rather not.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - *chuckle* That's an interesting response. Though I suppose quite admirable as well.

Mitsuru Kirijo
That's understandable. It would be a very difficult thing to do.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I realize it may be difficult given recent events, but have you been studying for the exams?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yes.
Not really.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Good. Keep it up, then.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I understand how you're feeling, but you must persevere.
Unfortunately, life can be quite cruel sometimes, but we have to keep moving forward anyway.
Well, good luck.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I was worried about how the loss of Aragaki would affect the rest of the team...
Happy - But it seems everyone is not letting it deter them. He must be smiling down on us from above.

Mitsuru Kirijo
So, how did you do on your exams?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I did well.
Pretty okay.
Not great...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Excellent.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Considering the circumstances, I'll accept "okay." Well done.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Well, I'm sure you did what you could, given the circumstances. Try not to be too hard on yourself.

Mitsuru Kirijo
All things considered, simply having made it through exams is praiseworthy in of itself.

Mitsuru Kirijo
The next full moon is approaching. Let's be prepared.
I want to be able to give a successful report to Aragaki.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hm... I can never tell what you're thinking, even when I'm looking straight at you...
So how are you feeling about our next operation? As I'm sure you know, it will be our last.
Are you nervous?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Of course.
Nah.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I understand... The tension grows stronger day by day...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - Really? That is quite impressive...
Happy - It is unusual for someone to maintain such composure in a situation like this.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I must admit, there is something exhilarating about knowing this will be our final battle.
Happy - I have no doubt that it'll be a fierce fight, but let's make sure we come out of it victorious.

Mitsuru Kirijo
SEES will most likely be disbanded after the final battle.
Happy - I have so many memories of my time in SEES... Both good and bad...
What about you? Would you say you enjoyed participating in SEES, overall?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, I did.
Well...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I'm glad. Then I hope you always remember the good times we shared together.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Don't worry. I'm not offended.
Happy - But regardless, thank you for all you've done.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I'm sure there must have been times when you would rather have left this all behind...
Happy - But despite that, you've been extremely helpful. I truly am grateful.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I don't think Strega will simply allow us to defeat the last Shadow.
They will either try to stop us outright or secretly set a trap for us.
What do you think they will do, Arisato?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Try to stop us outright.
Set a trap for us.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I agree. That seems to be their only viable option.
If they were to set a trap, Yamagishi would be able to detect it and we could avoid it easily.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It is certainly a possibility...
In that case, we will need to rely on Yamagishi to detect anything.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Thank you for all you've done for us.
Let's give it our all in the final battle.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Sorry, but I won't be going to Tartarus for a while.
Sad - *sigh* I can't seem to find a reason to fight...
Sad - Or a reason to live, for that matter...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Are you looking forward to the trip, Arisato?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I sure am!
Not really.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Well, I hope it will be memorable.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I see... If that has anything to do with my situation, please don't let it bother you.
I hope you enjoy your trip.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Kyoto is filled with many beautiful sights.
But the most memorable for me was the Kamogawa River, especially during the evening.
Happy - The sunset was absolutely amazing. I will never forget it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Kyoto is filled with many beautiful sights.
The sole blemish of the trip was an incident instigated by a group of peeping scoundrels.
Angry - Do you have anything to say for yourself?

Mitsuru Kirijo
The saying "Earnest labor brings happiness" is simply a pretext.
However, there are some people, like Yukari's father, who put their whole lives into their work.
At any rate, I'd advise you to take full advantage of this opportunity to learn about the workforce.

Mitsuru Kirijo
She was taking those drugs as well. If she hadn't died now, she most likely would have died soon.
But Fate chose the most beautiful way to end her life.

Mitsuru Kirijo
There's a saying, "Time heals all wounds." Do you think that will apply to Iori?
Losing a loved one isn't something you exactly get over, no matter how much time passes...
Perhaps it's best to leave him be to figure it out on his own for now.

Minato Arisato - Selection
You're right.
We should help him.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Yes...
Unfortunately, I'm not sure there's much else we can do...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I would like to, but I'm not sure what we could do...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Even though she was an avant-garde artist, she left a sketchbook filled with portraits of Iori.
You do understand the reasoning behind her drastic change in artistic style, yes?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yes, I do.
No, I don't.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Good. Don't forget it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Well, it's very important, so take some time and think about it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Take to heart your thoughts and feelings about that illustration of Iori.
You may just learn a life lesson that you'll need to draw upon someday.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Aigis said something akin to the idea that, as a machine, she is replaceable.
She may have been programmed that way, but it's still painful to hear...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I've never truly thought about my own life ending...
Sad - It feels like everything I thought I knew has been destroyed...

Mitsuru Kirijo
We should organize the information we already have. Is there anything you want to go over?

Minato Arisato - Selection
What happened to Aigis?
Why did Aigis dislike Ryoji?
Why does Ryoji look human?

Mitsuru Kirijo
After the incident, Aigis was taken to the laboratory.
Sad - The researchers are tending to her. But with the injuries she sustained, it's going to take a while.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Aigis may have lost her memories of the battle she waged with Ryoji Mochizuki ten years ago...
But some part of her must have still detected that he was a Shadow.
An incredibly strong Shadow that she had faced once before...

Mitsuru Kirijo
That is an excellent question. Ryoji Mochizuki is a Shadow...
The same Shadow that Aigis sealed inside you ten years ago.
Over those ten years, that Shadow changed as a result of being held within a human.
Eventually, it gained the appearance and characteristics of a human being itself.
Sad - And those human characteristics are what influenced it to give us a "choice."

Mitsuru Kirijo
Ikutsuki and my grandfather both accepted the Fall as the rightful fate of the world...
They didn't believe the world was worth saving...
Sad - What destroyed their hope for the future...?

Mitsuru Kirijo
I just got a report from the laboratory. They are optimistic that Aigis can be fully repaired.
Sad - However, they are unsure as to how long it may take...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Oh, I see...
But she was seriously damaged, so I'm just relieved to hear that they can fix her at all.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Yeah, me too. I hope she can come back soon, though...

Mitsuru Kirijo
We have to make such a difficult decision...
Could you ever have imagined that we'd be in this situation?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Never in a million years.
Yup.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Neither could I.
But regardless, it's happening. We must decide what we are going to do about it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...You're a very interesting person.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - We'll just have to clear our heads and come up with an answer.
...But even though I know what needs to be done, I'm still hesitant to actually do it...

Mitsuru Kirijo
I had considered the possibility that we could simply stop Ryoji from initiating the Fall.
But it appears that isn't a possibility after all...
And if we kill him, we'll lose our memories, but still be unable to prevent it...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Although I proposed living life as normally as possible, I suppose that's easier said than done.
Knowing what's going to happen...
It's almost too much to bear...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Everyone needs a break once in a while.
Happy - Would you like to join us?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Wait, Senpai! It's girl time, remember?

Ken Amada
Sad - But... what about me and Koromaru?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - *chuckle* It's okay. Dogs and grade-schoolers are allowed.

Koromaru
*pant* *pant*

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Well, you heard her. Sorry, but the decision has been made.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Children all over the world will receive presents from a jolly old man in a red suit...
But, one day, they will realize that the jolly old man doesn't really exist, and they will be sad...
But that sadness will eventually lead to maturity, and then they will leave their childish toys behind.
Happy - Christmas... What an interesting holiday...

Mitsuru Kirijo
I have no choice but to go on.
The answer was right in front of me the entire time...
If I don't make it, then someone else will have to take over the company.
Although, I have every intention of returning.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Don't think of this as our last Christmas.
Simply think of it as this year's Christmas... and enjoy it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I don't believe you have any business with me at the moment, Arisato.
Why don't you go somewhere with someone? It's Christmas, after all.
Sad - ......
Sad - Sorry. Forget what I just said...

Mitsuru Kirijo
There's only one week left...
I'm sure this will be both the longest and shortest week of our lives.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I feel much calmer now, compared to when we first learned of the coming events.
Happy - It must be because now I'm certain of the choice I wish to make.

Mitsuru Kirijo
When I think about my grandfather... and what he did...
Angry - I get so angry.
If it wasn't for him, everything would be okay right now.
I know it's not good to dwell on the past, but... *sigh*

Mitsuru Kirijo
Don't worry about Aigis. She is currently being treated with the utmost care.
Happy - I wouldn't accept anything less for a valuable teammate.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Have you heard?
Happy - Aigis will be back tonight.

Mitsuru Kirijo
The researchers at the laboratory told me she has developed something akin to emotions.
They said she appears more "human."

Mitsuru Kirijo
The day is finally here... I know my answer.

Mitsuru Kirijo
You and Mochizuki were alone. You could have killed him if you wanted to...
But you chose not to.
Happy - Thank you for making that decision.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'm glad that we were able to celebrate the new year, but...
This month is going to be very important.
Make sure you spend your time wisely.

Mitsuru Kirijo
The mantra of the cult is, "If you believe, you will be saved."
Ridiculous, isn't it? Similar lines have been used to brainwash the gullible throughout history.
We will need to keep our guards up.
The public seems to be fooled by these words.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It's been three days now. At least the pressure of making the decision itself has lifted, but...

Yukari Takeba
To be honest, I'm still not completely sure that we made the right choice...

Aigis
I'm sure such feelings are inevitable.
It's human nature to wonder about the choice that was not chosen.

Mitsuru Kirijo
That's true. People are always asking themselves, "What if...?"

Yukari Takeba
Well... I guess we'll always wonder, then...
But this is the choice we made, so let's do all we can with it so we don't regret it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Cases of Apathy Syndrome are on the rise again.
There have been a lot of people reported missing as well.
This is not good.
Sad - Society is crumbling before our eyes.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Honestly, there was a time last year when I thought Tartarus may not even have a peak.
I still feel somewhat nervous, but I'll take this over the anxiety of those times any day.
Happy - It's said that having a clear goal brings stability. Though this is quite a way to learn that moral.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I knew the cult would have some influence over the school, but to this extent...?
Can you think of any effective ways to counter them?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Just hope they resist the cult.
Eliminate the cult.
There's nothing we can do.

Mitsuru Kirijo
You're right...
All we can do is hope that people have it within them to withstand the cult's teachings.

Mitsuru Kirijo
The entire cult...? I would prefer not to do that.
Eliminating the cult should only be our last resort.

Mitsuru Kirijo
You may be right. Nyx's influence appears too great...
In that case, we'll just have to defeat Nyx itself to break the control the cult has over everyone.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Akihiko and I will be taking our college entrance examinations on the 16th and 17th.
So we'll be out during the afternoon, but we should be back before nightfall.
Therefore, we'll be available to go to Tartarus, so not to worry.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'd say 95% of the people referred to as "charismatic" by the media are charlatans.
And Strega are certainly not in the genuine 5%.
They don't have charisma. They're just agitators who are stirring up unrest in society.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Come to think of it, have you decided on a career path yet?
I recommend being proactive now so you're not overwhelmed as a third-year.
Remember, defeating Nyx isn't the end.
It's a means for us to keep moving forward.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Strega believes the Fall will bring "salvation." But I wonder what my grandfather thought of it...
He didn't believe in the future...
So perhaps he also thought like Strega.
But that's just speculation. The dead cannot speak on their own behalf, so we may never know...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Yes, Koromaru's physical condition and morale will need to be in top shape for the final battle.
Good thinking, Yukari.

Mitsuru Kirijo
The Kirijo Group will protect her with all the resources at its command.
That's a promise.

Mitsuru Kirijo
You'll be having your career consultation soon. Have you given it any consideration?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure have.
I can only think about Nyx.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Good. Speak with confidence when you meet with your teacher.

Mitsuru Kirijo
While I admire your determination...
After we defeat Nyx, our lives will continue on.
I'd advise you to make thinking about your future more of a priority.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Defeating Nyx is merely a milestone on the larger journey into the future.
Accordingly, you'll want to think hard about that future now.

Mitsuru Kirijo
The Promised Day is almost here.
This will be our last battle. There won't be any second chances.
Everything has been leading to this singular moment...
So make sure you're more prepared than ever.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I wasn't able to protect my father...
But his dreams live on inside of me.
I'll make sure they come true...
...All right, let's get going.

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'm ready.
Give me a minute.

Mitsuru Kirijo
From here on out, there's no turning back...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Once we enter Tartarus, I know that
we won't leave until the battle is over...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Are you absolutely certain that you're ready?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Ready as I'll ever be.
Not quite yet.

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right, then let's go.

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right. Then let me know once you've finished preparing.
Everyone else is ready whenever you are.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I apologize for all the trouble. But please accept my thanks all the same.
I want you to know that I fully intend to do all I can to honor his memory.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I must file a report with the Kirijo Group...
Sad - The formatting is tricky... I'll have to do some research.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru seems busy.
I doubt she's in the mood
to go to the movies...

Mitsuru Kirijo
With Amada on our team, we have more manpower.
Although he's still a child...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Looks like there's something
on Mitsuru's mind.
I doubt she's in the mood
to go to the movies...

Mitsuru Kirijo
I haven't had a free day in some time, but it's here at last.
It's inevitable when one has a month off that there will be at least one day with a clear schedule.
Happy - Hmm... What should I do?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru seems to be free today.

Mitsuru Kirijo - MND_005_1_0
Should I invite Mitsuru to the film festival?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Invite to the movies
Don't invite

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hm... The movies...
I just remembered that I received VIP tickets from a distributor...
Happy - ...I think I'll make use of them.
Happy - All right, let's go.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I had a great time yesterday.
I've only ever seen employee previews before... I've never had a chance to see a movie start to finish before.
I'm sorry about all the extra attention we got because of my VIP tickets...
Happy - Anyway, thank you for inviting me.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I have plans today. I'll be back before it's dark, though.
Sad - Keeping busy with work suits me more than being idle. I found it hard to pass time yesterday since I had nothing to do.
Sad - So I decided to take a nap... which actually gave me a headache.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru seems busy.
I doubt she's in the mood

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Right now, the Temperance Arcana
may help me grow even more...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - What is it?

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_5_0
Come to think of it, Elizabeth asked
me to get a specific item for her...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - Hm? You're looking for a triangular sword?
Surprised - Is that supposed to be a riddle? I'm not sure what you mean...
Hm, a triangular object used for dueling...
By any chance, are you talking about a fencing épée?
It's not a triangular sword, no, but the cross-section does resemble a triangle.
Let me retrieve mine for you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Here you go. Do you plan on taking up fencing?
If so, I can teach you a thing or two once I have some spare time.

===============================================================================================

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hm? Is something the matter?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Just wanted to chat.
What's everyone's status?
Let's go to Tartarus.
Never mind.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Very well. We'll meet at Tartarus around midnight. Don't be late.
I'll let the others know.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Everyone can go tonight.

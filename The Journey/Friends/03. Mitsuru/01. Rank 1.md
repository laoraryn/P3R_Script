Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - So, Arisato, um...

Mitsuru Kirijo
I need to know the etiquette of this place. Are there any customs I should follow?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Slurp the noodles.
Add a lot of toppings.
Don't let it get soggy.
Drink all the soup.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, r-right, slurping is considered polite! I've heard about that.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I hope I can do this correctly...

Mitsuru Kirijo
So we select the number of toppings ourselves? I see...

Mitsuru Kirijo
How interesting that they leave that to the discretion of the consumer.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - Oh! Understood. So it's important to eat quickly, then...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sounds sensible. I imagine said eagerness shows respect to the chef, as well.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - A-All of it!? Does everyone do that...?

Mitsuru Kirijo
I... I'll do my best.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Now then... Let us begin.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Bon appetit!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hmm... What a fascinating flavor...
I thought it strange at first, but it carries with it a subtle complexity.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - ...Yes, this is quite delicious.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Excuse me, Mr. Chef de Cuisine?

Ramen Shop Owner
Chef de cuisine? You talkin' to me?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Your ramen is absolutely wonderful. It's been a while since I last gave my compliments to the chef.
What do you use for the bouillon?

Ramen Shop Owner
Bouillon...? What the hell is that?

Ramen Shop Owner
If yer askin' about the recipe, sorry, miss. Can't tell ya.

Ramen Shop Owner
That's how we put bread on the table.

Mitsuru Kirijo
So it's a secret recipe... I completely understand. You don't have to tell me.

Mitsuru Kirijo
You mentioned this dish puts bread on the table? I suppose that means it comes in sandwich form as well...

Mitsuru Kirijo
I see. What a fascinating delicacy.

Ramen Shop Owner
Uh, that ain't exactly... Well, whatever.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - The recipe of something this delectable could likely be patented and sold for quite a profit...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, sorry, um... My imagination got the best of me.
I'd been wanting to try ramen for a long time.
......
Do you find that... unusual?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Very.
Not at all.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I see...
I would have been free to visit as I pleased, but...
Dining alone is... rather awkward.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, that's good to hear.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I never had the opportunity to eat this kind of food growing up...
The style of restaurant is new to me, too.
So I have to admit... it's something I've always wanted to try.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I'm glad we came here today. You've already taught me so much about ramen etiquette.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I would love to return here in the future.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I saw an unexpected side of Mitsuru.
I feel like our relationship has grown...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, I didn't notice the time.
We should be going.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We decided to go back to the dorm.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sorry to drag you along on this personal venture.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - ......

Minato Arisato - Selection
Looking for something specific?
Need some help?
Borrowing a book?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - No, not exactly. But thank you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Looking through the literature section made me realize something.
There are so many books about romance, but far fewer on the domestic life that comes after it.
I wonder if that means the most exciting time in one's life comes prior to the wedding...
Sad - Does everyone go into marriage with the expectation of losing something?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hm? Oh, no. There's no need.
Happy - Thank you, though.

Sad - Does everyone go into marriage with the expectation of losing something?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - ...Hm? Oh, sorry.
I was just a little distracted.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - My mind was getting away from me... It's been happening quite often as of late.
Happy - What a bad habit of mine. I should be more conscious of it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
The truth is, the Group is in turmoil over the inheritance issue.
Sad - And some of the older members are of the opinion that a student like me isn't up to the task...
But... I'm the daughter of the head of the Group. I need to show that I can take the lead.
...Even if I have to make sacrifices to do it.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Did something happen?
That doesn't sound good.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - A... fiancé has been chosen for me.

Mitsuru Kirijo
He's the new president of one of our affiliates, and he's much older than me...
But if I agree to the marriage, the future of the company will be secured.

Mitsuru Kirijo
He's planning to announce the partnership and our engagement at the same time.
Doing so will give the appearance that the company is stable both inside and out.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - This is the best solution for everyone involved...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Is it really?
I didn't know...

Mitsuru Kirijo
This was decided a long time ago. It's just going to take place a bit sooner than originally planned, that's all.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - This is... for the best...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Well, of course you didn't.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - You're the only person I've told so far.

Mitsuru Kirijo
My mother and father walked the same path.
So... I won't run from my fate.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Are you sure about this?
That's admirable.
I'll do something about it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Of course I am.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Think about it. What would I do if I broke off the engagement?
Leave everything behind and go on a journey of self-discovery?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - ......
Sad - Why would you ask me that? You're making me doubt myself...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I'm... glad to hear that you agree.
Sad - ......
Happy - Yes... No matter what happens, I can't turn my back on the Kirijo name.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - ...!
Angry - You shouldn't make promises you can't keep. What could you possibly do?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Still, though...
Sad - Hearing you say that almost makes me want to believe.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mitsuru looks conflicted...
I feel like our relationship has grown...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - ...Say, Arisato.
Sad - Recently, I've been feeling a little hesitant about meeting up with you like this.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I already made the decision to carry out my duty.
Sad - But... whenever I talk with you, my resolve begins to falter.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Why do I feel this way when I'm with you...?
Sad - ......

Mitsuru Kirijo
...I think it would be best if we left off here for today.
Sorry to do this after inviting you out here, but I need to head home and go over some paperwork on the partnership.
Excuse me.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After parting ways with Mitsuru,
I decided to return to the dorm.

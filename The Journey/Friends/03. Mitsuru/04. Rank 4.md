Mitsuru Kirijo
You know, there's not much time left for us to spend like this...

Mitsuru Kirijo
In just a short while, we'll be looking back on these days with nostalgia.

Minato Arisato - Selection
What's next for you?
Did something happen?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Well...
Sad - ......

Mitsuru Kirijo
No... I'm probably just tired. It's nothing you need to worry about.
Sad - ......

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Since my father passed away, I've been faced with a number of complicated issues.
Sad - My inheritance... the future of the Kirijo Group... and the expectations of everyone involved with both...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - It's possible I won't be going to college or starting a career. I may need to walk a different path.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Say, Arisato...
What does marriage mean to you?

Minato Arisato - Selection
It's all for love.
It's a social agreement.
It's about compromise.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Heh... That's a straightforward answer.

Mitsuru Kirijo
However, I'm a Kirijo. I can't let my feelings tug me around when making these decisions.
An agreement between two parties—such as marriage—takes careful consideration.

Mitsuru Kirijo
That's true.
Marriage is a union in a social context as well... That's what differentiates it from simply dating.
Sad - Yes, I shouldn't have needed to ask you about that...

Mitsuru Kirijo
I don't know about that.
Compromise is something that can only occur if both sides are willing.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Or are you speaking from experience?

Mitsuru Kirijo
My parents' marriage was arranged for strategic reasons.
But, as time passed, they slowly grew to honestly love each other.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I don't think they were unhappy with their lives... Love can take many different forms.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Am I... wrong about this?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Do you have a boyfriend?
That's a tough one.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Exasperated* - Please, wouldn't you know if I did? We're living under the same roof.
Sad - Besides, that's a bit...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - How do I say this? Romance... just isn't my strong suit.

Mitsuru Kirijo
If I could speak with my father one last time, I would ask him directly.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - ......

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I lent an ear to Mitsuru...
I feel like our relationship has grown...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Looks like we ended up staying until closing time.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Talking in the library... I'm not setting a very good example as student council president.

Mitsuru Kirijo
We should go.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We left the library and returned to the dorm.

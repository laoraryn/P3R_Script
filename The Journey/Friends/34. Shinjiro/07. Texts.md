It's Aragaki.


I got your number from Kirijo.
If you're free, come by the back alley again.

Looks like Aragaki wants to hang out...
Should I meet up with him?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Meet with Aragaki
Not now

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Let's head to where Aragaki is.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Come to think of it, Mitsuru left me
with the school reinstatement form...
Should I meet with Aragaki?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Come to think of it, I still have Aragaki's
leave of absence extension form...
Should I meet with him?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Aragaki seems bored. Come to think
of it, there's a film festival today...
Watching today's movie might help me gain
more ... Should I invite Aragaki?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Go with Aragaki
Not now

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Let's head to where Aragaki is.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I'll reply later...

Shinjiro Aragaki
You again. What do you want?
......

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I found Aragaki.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I give Aragaki the re-enrollment
form Mitsuru entrusted me with...?

Shinjiro Aragaki
......
...I said, what do you want?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I should give Aragaki the re-enrollment
form Mitsuru entrusted me with...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Spend time with Aragaki
Not now

Shinjiro Aragaki
You got a bone to pick or somethin'...?

Shinjiro Aragaki
You got no business in a place like this. Get the hell outta here.

-----

Shinjiro Aragaki
So, whaddaya want?

Shinjiro Aragaki
What's this supposed to be?

Shinjiro Aragaki
Surprised - Why do you have this...?
......
...Oh, now I get it. Kirijo put you up to this.

Minato Arisato - Selection
She asked me to.
You picked up on that fast.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Typical... She always goes out of her way for the dumbest shit.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Exasperated* - She's tried this a few times already. I knew this envelope looked familiar.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Think for yourself for once. Don't just go along with what everyone asks.

Minato Arisato - Selection
I just wanted to help.
I'm worried about you, too.
Sorry.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Sad - You gotta learn how to say no.
This is how they ended up pushing the role of leader on you.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...Mind your own damn business. Why are you all like this...?
But I guess you can't. Explains why you've accepted being leader.

Shinjiro Aragaki
I'm not really blaming you.
Happy - Tch, you're an odd one. And, thanks to you, I got roped in again...

Shinjiro Aragaki
......
We done? Then get outta here.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Hey.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Thanks for goin' through all that trouble.
Happy - Maybe I'll... treat you to a meal sometime.

Shinjiro Aragaki
What, you got a problem with that?

Minato Arisato - Selection
How about right now?
You're not heading back yet?

Shinjiro Aragaki
Exasperated* - I told you to get going. I already got plans.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Exasperated* - Who cares? Quit asking stupid questions.

Shinjiro Aragaki
It doesn't matter. I'll be back by tonight.
...That's why I rejoined in the first place.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Sad - Tch...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I decided to go back to
the dorm without Aragaki.
I was able to give Aragaki the letter
without getting intimidated by him. I feel
like my  has improved...

Shinjiro Aragaki
Hey. Can anybody use the rooftop planters?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Of course.
Why, curious?

Shinjiro Aragaki
I see.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...No, not exactly.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...Looks like they changed some stuff. Can't believe they gave us something like that.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Gardening, huh...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's grow something together.
I'll leave it to you.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Hmph, why should I do it with you...?
...I guess that's fine.
But, if you wanna do it with me, I'm gonna make sure you do it properly.
Don't think you're done once you've planted the seeds.
If you get impatient... then don't bother.

Shinjiro Aragaki
What? You planted them but you ain't even taking care of them?
If you start somethin', you gotta see it through and look after them 'til the end.
...Well, I wouldn't mind showing you how it's done.

Shinjiro Aragaki

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Tending to the rooftop planters might
help improve the quality of the produce...

Shinjiro Aragaki
I'm gonna head up. What about you?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Go to the rooftop
Not now

Shinjiro Aragaki
We oughta check in on those rooftop planters...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Tending to the rooftop planters might
help improve the quality of the produce...

Shinjiro Aragaki
...Looks like you got some free time.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Help Aragaki
Not now

Shinjiro Aragaki
...Hey. You got time? I wanna check on the rooftop planters...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Aragaki seems determined...
Tending to the rooftop planters might
help improve the quality of the produce...
Aragaki might gain a new ability soon...

Shinjiro Aragaki
You're comin' too, aren't ya?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Go to the rooftop
Not now

Shinjiro Aragaki
...Did you eat the ones you harvested?
You still wanna do this? I ain't gonna force you...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It doesn't seem like Aragaki will gain any
more new skills even if I garden with him...
But tending to the rooftop planters might
help improve the quality of the produce...

Shinjiro Aragaki
If you got nothin' to do, come with me.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Go to the rooftop
Not now

Shinjiro Aragaki
...What. I got business on the roof.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Tending to the rooftop planters might
help improve the quality of the produce...

Shinjiro Aragaki
...You wanna help out?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Go to the rooftop
Not now

Shinjiro Aragaki
What, you comin' too?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It doesn't seem like Aragaki will gain any
more new skills even if I garden with him...
But tending to the rooftop planters might
help improve the quality of the produce...

Shinjiro Aragaki
C'mon, join me if you're free.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Go to the rooftop
Not now

Minato Arisato - Thoughts

Shinjiro Aragaki
C'mon, join me if you're free.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Go to the rooftop
Not now

Shinjiro Aragaki
Happy - ...Alright. Let's go then.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...Alright.

------

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Aragaki is working silently...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I tended the rooftop planters with Aragaki...

Shinjiro Aragaki
Hope they don't taste too bitter...

Shinjiro Aragaki
If these temperatures keep up, they'll probably get pretty big.

Shinjiro Aragaki
That's probably enough fertilizer. The rest is up to the weather.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Thanks to the care we put in, it looks
like the plants will grow nicely...

Shinjiro Aragaki
Let's head back now.

-----

Shinjiro Aragaki
I think that about does it...
......
You think you can see this through to the end?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I got this!
I'd like to.
No promises...

Shinjiro Aragaki
Happy - Good answer.
Happy - Let's just hope you can maintain that enthusiasm.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Happy - Yeah? Well, alright then.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Exasperated* - You're an honest one, aren't you?
Happy - Well, stick around for today at least.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Once you start something, you gotta see it through to the end.
I only dabbled in this back when I was a kid, but... it'll probably turn out fine.

Shinjiro Aragaki
When I was still at the orphanage, I learned a bunch of stuff with Aki...
...I'm talkin' too much. Let's get back to work.

-----

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I tended the plants with Aragaki...

Shinjiro Aragaki
...That should do it.
This kind of work is usually easier with more people. Come help out again when you've got the time.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Thanks to the care we put in, it looks
like the plants will grow nicely...

Shinjiro Aragaki
Let's head back now.
...And wash your hands after handling all that soil.

Shinjiro Aragaki
It's nice that we don't have as much crap to deal with up here.
There aren't as many weeds or pests on the roof, and no moles or other critters that'll dig our plants up.
Still gotta watch out, though...
Some hungry asshole might try to help himself to the whole crop.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Normally, that wouldn't happen.
They're getting executed.
Sorry about that...

Shinjiro Aragaki
Yeah. Normally...

Shinjiro Aragaki
...Didn't know you were so hot-blooded.
Most of us here are decent and mature enough that we'd ask before doin' something like that.
...With one exception.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Nah, you're fine. You're the one growin' 'em, after all.
Just know when to hold back. Don't end up like a certain other dumbass around here.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...I mentioned I did a bit of gardening back at the orphanage, right?
If someone sneaks a bite, it's no big deal, but this one time some older kids stole our whole crop...
Aki got so pissed when that happened.
He went after 'em all by himself, even though they were twice as tall as he was...
...Then again, that's probably not much different from how he is now.

Shinjiro Aragaki
He hasn't changed at all.
Compare that to these guys, growing bigger every day...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I tended the plants with Aragaki...

Shinjiro Aragaki
This should be good for today.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Thanks to the care we put in, it looks
like the plants will grow nicely...

Shinjiro Aragaki
You can head on back.
I'll stay and finish up. You can thank me by helpin' out again sometime.

Shinjiro Aragaki
If this keeps up, we'll be in good shape.

Shinjiro Aragaki
If there are any crops that are bruised or misshapen, give 'em to me.
They'll still taste fine, and nothin' beats eating 'em freshly picked.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Oh, right. Don't just leave the stems and roots laying around after harvesting the crops.
Take 'em out and replace the soil right away. You can't replant anything until you do that.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Got it.
That's so wasteful.
What a pain.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Happy - I'm glad you pick up on stuff so quickly. Less trouble that way.
Happy - You're great to work with, unlike a certain someone.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Cut it out. You sound like Aki.
I might not be around to help next time, so just do what I say.

Shinjiro Aragaki
You're the one in charge of these. Ya gotta think about whoever's gonna use them after you.
I might not be here to help next time, so just do what I say.

Shinjiro Aragaki
You know, I only started this on a whim, but it's worth it every now and then.
Even someone like me can, well... How do I put this...?
Growing something lets you see the result of your labor, so you feel like you built it with your own hands.
Its life cycle ends once you eat it, though.

Minato Arisato - Selection
It becomes our sustenance.
We still have our memories.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Yeah, true.
We get hungry just bein' alive, so I guess they play their part.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Happy - That's so damn cheesy.
But you know, maybe you're right.
I thought I'd forgotten all about gardening as a kid.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Even if someone disappears, maybe they can still leave somethin' behind...
......

Shinjiro Aragaki
Nothin'. Just talkin' to myself.
Sad - Guess that ain't really like me.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Aragaki seems to have realized
something through tending the garden...

Shinjiro Aragaki
I ended up sayin' a little too much today.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Break time's over. Let's get back to it.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I tended the plants with Aragaki...

Shinjiro Aragaki
Alright, that just about does it.
Thanks for your help. If you ever do this again, I'll join you.
Time to head back.

Shinjiro Aragaki

Shinjiro Aragaki
That's probably enough fertilizer. The rest is up to the weather.

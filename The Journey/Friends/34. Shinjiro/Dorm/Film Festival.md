Shinjiro Aragaki
Surprised - "From Paws to Whiskers"...? This is what we're seeing...?

Shinjiro Aragaki
Exasperated* - Well... If this is what you really want, I guess I'm game, too.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We watched tiny animals fighting
to survive with all their strength...
It taught us about the harshness of nature

Shinjiro Aragaki

Sorry, I... gotta go.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I let Aragaki go ahead, then
returned to the dorm myself.

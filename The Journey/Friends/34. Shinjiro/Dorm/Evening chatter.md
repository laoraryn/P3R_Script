Shinjiro Aragaki
I'll be joining you guys from here on.
...Well, I'm a former member, so I'm just gonna do my own thing.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Looks like we'll be working together for now.
But, I'm gonna take a backseat for today... I'll be ready tomorrow, so hit me up anytime.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...What do you want?
The full moon is tomorrow, isn't it? Shouldn't you be preparing for that instead of wandering around?
Well, if you want to go to Tartarus tonight, I'll join you.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Can't believe he got played like that...
Where'd his game go...?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Go easy on him.
Pathetic.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Hmph, I ain't actually pissed or anything.
I'm just saying he shouldn't put up with that.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...What's done is done. Anyway, you better be careful too.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...Hey.
How long is Junpei going to keep this up?
Hmph... You should keep a lookout for him.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...I was just thinking about asking you.
Is that Chidori girl still in the hospital?
Tch... Just hope he doesn't get in trouble...

Shinjiro Aragaki
By the way...
I heard Junpei's in charge of finding out more about that Chidori girl.
Is he really our best shot...? Well, better than Kirijo or Aki, I guess.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...What?
Bother someone else if you're bored. I got nothing to offer you.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...Just one thing.
Whether or not I fit into your battle plan is up to you.
You can remove me from the party whenever you think that's for the better.
Don't worry about my feelings.

Shinjiro Aragaki
So, a large Shadow will appear during the full moon...
And you've already beat nine of 'em, huh?
Not bad. Let's just hope we can keep this streak up.

Shinjiro Aragaki
The culture festival... I forgot we did that.
That crap doesn't interest me.

Shinjiro Aragaki
The culture festival... I forgot we did that.
I hate that stuff. I try not to think about it.

Shinjiro Aragaki
A wish, huh...
Tch, why can't he act like a normal kid...?

Shinjiro Aragaki
Looks like you're feeling better.
Anyway, take it easy today. Who do you think has to deal with you collapsing?

Shinjiro Aragaki
Tartarus and the Dark Hour are still dragging on, huh...
Dammit... Why won't they just disappear...?

Shinjiro Aragaki
...What, you bored?
Then go bother the chairman or something. He'd love a captive audience for his terrible puns.

Minato Arisato - Selection
If the mood strikes.
Let's go together.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...I see. You're a weird one.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...What? I'll pass.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...You.
If you wanna kill some time, go find Junpei or something.
I only take orders in battle.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Damn, this is one hell of a mess...
Not only are we fightin' Shadows, now we gotta deal with Strega, too...
You better train up while you can. It'll be too late for regrets later on.

Shinjiro Aragaki
One more week, huh...
You might think you have this down...
But don't drop your guard 'til the end.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Hmph, Mr. Chairman sure is carefree...
I told him not to overestimate my ability. Don't rely on me too much.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...The hell. Calm as always, I see.
Got nerves of steel, even though it's almost the full moon?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'm looking forward to it.
It is pretty nerve-racking.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Hmph, you're just like a certain musclebound moron...
I guess you really are a natural at this sorta lifestyle.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...That so.
Anyway, we just gotta beat three more Shadows and we're in the clear. Just hang on 'til then.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...Tomorrow's it, huh.
'Bout time those Shadows got a fire under their asses. Make sure you're prepared.
I'll... do what I gotta do, too.

===============================================================================================

Shinjiro Aragaki
...You finally look better.
When you were sick, your face was pale as a ghost.
Happy - I'm glad to see you up and around.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...Huh? Film festival?
I totally forgot they did those... Not that I've ever been to one.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I invite him to the film festival?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Invite him to the movies
Don't invite

Shinjiro Aragaki
Surprised - ...With me?
Surprised - ......
Hmph... Weirdo.
Well, let's go.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Right now, the Temperance Arcana
may help me grow even more...

===============================================================================================

Shinjiro Aragaki
What do you want?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Come to think of it, Elizabeth asked
me to get a specific item for her...

Shinjiro Aragaki
Surprised - Huh...? You want a fruit knife?
Surprised - What for?
You gonna use it for cooking? Hold on.

Shinjiro Aragaki
There you go.
Happy - It's kinda old, but it has a great grip.
Happy - ...You can have it.

Hey. I wanna use the kitchen...   
There any rules about sharing ingredients and dishes we can use? Stuff like that?   
I wanna hear more about the kitchen rules from you... I'll return the favor.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Looks like Aragaki wants   
to use the kitchen...   
Should I spend some time with Aragaki?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Or, are you busy?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's go to the kitchen.   
I'm a bit busy right now.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Tch, I bought too much. Guess I'll freeze 'em...   
What are you standing around for?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Aragaki's cooking skills are on par   
with that of a professional chef...   
If I get Aragaki to teach me, I might   
be able to make some delicious food...   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...What do you want?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Teach me how to cook.   
It's nothing.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
One time, I brought a lost kid at the strip mall to the police station...   
It turned out he was the son of a fishmonger, and he thanked me like crazy.   
Why am I even telling you this?   
If you ain't in a hurry, go wait in the kitchen. I'll be there later.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Looks like Aragaki wants to   
do something in the kitchen...   
Aragaki might gain a new ability soon...   
Should I spend some time with him?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
It'll go faster with two people to do it together.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Go to the kitchen   
Not now   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
It's about time for some food.   
...You coming, too?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It doesn't seem like Aragaki will gain any   
more new skills even if I cook with him...   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
If you wanna get good, you gotta put in the practice.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Go to the kitchen   
Think about it   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Happy - ...Alright, let's go.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
I see... Alright.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Huh? Why should I...?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Tch... Don't think I'll go easy on you.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...That so.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...What's up?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Aragaki said he wanted to use the kitchen...   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
If you're free, I want you to show me around the kitchen.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
What is it?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It doesn't seem like Aragaki will gain any   
more new skills even if I cook with him...   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Join me if you have the time.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Go to the kitchen   
Think about it   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend some time with Aragaki?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
C'mon, join me if you have some time.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Go to the kitchen   
Think about it   
   
-----   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Aragaki is working at a brisk pace...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I spent time cooking with Aragaki...   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Happy - Looks like you got the hang of things. The food wasn't bad today.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Alright, let's clean up.   
   
-----   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...I see.   
So if there's leftovers, we can keep them in the fridge.   
But, we're cooking for two today, so there probably won't be leftovers.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Oh, I forgot to mention, but I'm making katsudon.   
Make sure to eat it all, no matter how it tastes.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You're making it?   
Only if it tastes good.   
I prefer ramen.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
I said I'd thank you, didn't I?   
If you don't want it, I could put the meat away... But that's a pain, so just eat it.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...You got guts sayin' that.   
Well, I'm makin' this to thank you, so I'm not gonna give you somethin' terrible.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Sad - ...I said I'd thank you, but this place ain't equipped to make that.   
I want somethin' with rice. So we're havin' katsudon today, got it?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Alright then, time to get started.   
The rice is already cooked, so just scoop everything into a bowl once it's ready.   
...I like extra large portions, by the way.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I watched Aragaki cook. His skill is on   
par with that of a professional chef...   
......   
The katsudon is ready.   
Crunchy, flaky breaded pork, topped with   
half-cooked egg... I could eat this all day!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Happy - Looks like you're a fan, huh?   
......   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Anyone can make this, long as they practice.   
Today we just had the rice and toppings, but you could add side dishes too...   
Well, give it a try when you have time.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Alright, I did my part to thank you. You handle the cleanup.   
See ya around.   
   
-----   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
We're havin' katsudon again, got it?   
...Don't give me that look. We got a lot of pork 'cause it was cheap.   
Part of me thinks startin' with fried food might be hard, but the basics are pretty much the same.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
You're a real oddball, you know that? Askin' me to teach you how to cook.   
Why do you wanna learn so much?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I care about my health.   
I just felt like it.   
I want to be popular.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...Ya do, huh?   
Well, good a reason as any.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Sad - You don't really think things through, do you?   
Well, whatever. It can't hurt to know.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Well, we all got our own reasons...   
Can't hurt to know this stuff. But you better put in the work if you wanna be popular.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
I was taught how to cook by someone else too.   
So, when I see someone who wants to learn, I can kinda relate.   
Alright, that's enough rambling. Let's get started.   
...You're gonna do it this time. So first, get the meat ready.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
When you're frying something, stick a chopstick in the oil and check for little bubbles.   
Wait, you're putting on too much heat. The meat ain't gonna taste good if it's too tough.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Happy - Pretty good job, considering it was your first try.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
You've still got room for improvement though. Especially in the way you handle the knife and fryer...   
But if you're serious about it, then just practice.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Alright, let's clean up.   
You ain't done cooking until everything's put away, so don't slack off.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This is... a box full of sawdust...   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...Today, we're usin' that to make tempura bowls.   
Go ahead and take out what's in the box.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
......   
...!?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It's a box of shrimp!   
Living... wriggling... shrimp...   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Exasperated* - Getting these delivered is a royal pain in the ass, so I went and got 'em just now.   
I'm gonna get the other stuff ready. You focus on prepping those guys.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Leave it to me.   
Let's do it together.   
I can't do living things...   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Happy - Yeah, it's all you.   
I'll handle the first one, so pay attention and just do the same.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Exasperated* - ...Sorry, but I gotta work on the fish and other parts.   
I'll do the first one, and then you do the rest.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
First, put it on its back. Then, you work the knife into the edge of the shell...   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Angry - Don't get squeamish on me.   
I'll do the first one, and then you do the rest.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
First, put it on its back. Then, you work the knife into the edge of the shell...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I struggled to prep the live shrimp,   
following Aragaki's instructions...   
......   
We managed to work together   
to finish the tempura bowls!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Happy - ...The taste is pretty good, although I guess we did use good shrimp.   
Happy - You've gotten a lot better too. You're more comfortable with the knife and fryer now.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
All you gotta do now is keep practicin'.   
Get the basics down, then just find the right way to cook the stuff you have.   
Happy - ...That's how I was taught.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You had a great teacher.   
Who'd you learn from?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Happy - Hah, more like, a stubborn old man.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Happy - I'd say... he was an oddball who couldn't mind his own business.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
A long time ago, I used to work part-time at a restaurant.   
The manager drilled me on how to cook. He gave me so much shit back then, but...   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Happy - When I think back on it now, it wasn't really a bad experience.   
Happy - He always used to say, "Learning to cook is the first step to supporting yourself."   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
But, not only that...   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
If I didn't know how to do it myself, I wouldn't be teaching you like I am right now.   
I ain't gonna teach you every little thing...   
Happy - I can at least be here to show you how it's done. Gives me somethin' to do, too.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Aragaki has a genuine smile on his face...   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...Oh, right. Let's eat up and then put everything away.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
You can head back to your room once you're finished. I'll handle the cleanup.   
I'm gonna give some to Koro-cha— ...   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...I gotta make Koromaru's dinner still.   
Exasperated* - ......   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Angry - ...You got a problem?

Shinjiro Aragaki
...Hey.
So, whaddaya want?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I found Aragaki.
Should I talk to Aragaki and return
the leave of absence renewal form...?

Shinjiro Aragaki
...You need something?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I talk to Aragaki and return
the leave of absence renewal form...?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Spend time with Aragaki
Not now

Shinjiro Aragaki
You wanna talk to me about something?
Surprised - That's...

Shinjiro Aragaki
...Let's go somewhere else. You hungry?

Shinjiro Aragaki
I see.
By the way, that—

......
...Never mind.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...I don't think I ever told you about how things were before you joined.
SEES originally started off with only three members.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Back in middle school, I invited Akihiko to join, and Aragaki followed him soon after.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...We had no idea what we were doing back then.
We were young, inexperienced... and we had almost no intel to work off of.
We could barely even make it past the entrance to Tartarus back then...
Actually exploring the tower, like we're doing now, was nothing more than a pipe dream.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Even with all our shortcomings, we worked decently as a team.
Happy - As peers, it was easy for us to connect, and the work was hard, but fulfilling.

Minato Arisato - Selection
I can't even imagine.
I wish I could've seen it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not complaining about our current circumstances.
We've discovered how to eliminate the Dark Hour, and we've since grown much stronger.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - However... after what happened in Yakushima, and with Aragaki rejoining... it's hard not to remember the old days.
Sad - ...Maybe I'm so concerned about re-enrolling him in school because I'm still living in the past.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Living in the past?
Why's his attendance so vital?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Yes.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Well...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Some time after we started working as a team, we all came to an agreement.
We promised we'd all graduate together... No one left behind.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Akihiko was just as reckless back then, too.
Aragaki was always the one reminding him that our lives were at stake.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Although, his wording certainly wasn't quite so thoughtful...

Minato Arisato - Selection
What a surprise.
I can imagine.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I know, right? I was surprised, too.
But, Aragaki didn't use to distance himself from others like he does now.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Heh, it suits him, doesn't it? I guess you've gotten to know him well.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Ever since he left the team, he's acted like he's wanted to punish himself.
Sad - It's almost like he just wants to waste away...
Looking away - I'm hoping he'll remember his promise and take a step back and look at himself.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...That's why I gave you the paperwork to get him back in school.
That was my last hope, but I suppose it didn't work out. I'll tell Akihiko myself.

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right, I'll take this. I'll start on the process for extending his leave of absence.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
......
It seems like Mitsuru and Sanada were really
hoping Aragaki would return to school...
I should think carefully about
whether to hand this over or not...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - ...What's the matter?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Wait a minute.
Nothing.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - ...Oh, sure. What's wrong, though? Is it missing a page?
I'll let you handle it, then. Make sure to let Aragaki know as well.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Very well, thank you. I'm sorry you had to hold on to this for so long.
I'll take care of things from here. Make sure to let Aragaki know as well.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I took the leave of absence extension
form and left the student council room.
Maybe I should look for Aragaki
and get him to reconsider...

===============================================================================================

Shinjiro Aragaki
......
So, why're you still carryin' that thing around?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I couldn't hand it over.
You need to rethink this.

Shinjiro Aragaki
......
Looks like you're not just playing errand boy this time.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Sorry, but I'm not goin' back to school.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...Since it's you, I guess I'll say it. I ain't gonna live much longer.
I'm getting by on meds right now, but that won't last forever.

Minato Arisato - Selection
How did that happen...?
Is there anything we can do...?

Shinjiro Aragaki
Sad - ......
Sad - I didn't know my limits, and I bit off more than I could chew... This is what I deserve.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...This is probably the part where I ask God for a miracle. But that's never worked for me.

Shinjiro Aragaki
This is my body we're talkin' about. I know it better than anyone. And I know there's nothin' I can do.

Server
Here ya go, two specials!

Shinjiro Aragaki
Eat up. The noodles're getting soggy.

Shinjiro Aragaki
......
I know it seems like I wasted your time, but...

Shinjiro Aragaki
It's the good memories that stay with you and get people through their struggles...
But it's also the mistakes you made that haunt you forever.
I gotta use what time I have left to set things straight. I don't have the luxury of doing anything else.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Don't forget your promise.
You have to keep your word.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Surprised - ...!
Damn, you really don't mince your words, do ya?

Shinjiro Aragaki
Happy - ...But y'know, that ain't so bad.
Happy - It's way more refreshing than havin' someone keep quiet 'cause they're scared of hurtin' my feelings.

Shinjiro Aragaki
That's gotta be why they depend on you so much.
Aki and Kirijo are fighting with way more confidence than they had two years ago.
Yeah, you're just somethin' special.

Shinjiro Aragaki
But look, if you got time to waste on me, then go spend it on someone else.
Sad - Like Amada, he's still just a kid. He's way in over his head.
Sad - I'm still gonna do whatever I can to help, but after that...

Shinjiro Aragaki
...I'm counting on you.

Shinjiro Aragaki
I'll hold onto this.
...Yeah, I should've been the one to hand it in. Sorry I put that on you.

Shinjiro Aragaki
You can head on outside. I'm paying today.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Sad - ......

Shinjiro Aragaki
Thanks. Money's on the counter.

Server
Thanks, come again!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Aragaki and I quietly
headed back to the dorm...
I feel like Aragaki's trust in me
has given me ...

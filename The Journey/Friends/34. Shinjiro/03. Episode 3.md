Shinjiro Aragaki
Sorry for calling you up so suddenly.
You got a minute? There's something I wanna talk about.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I spend the evening with Aragaki?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Spend time with Aragaki
Not now

Shinjiro Aragaki
Happy - ...Thanks. Shouldn't take too long.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...I see. Catch ya next time, then.

-----

Shinjiro Aragaki
I got a favor to ask ya.
Give this to Kirijo, preferably while you're at school.

Shinjiro Aragaki
I haven't suddenly decided to go back to school or anything.
That's a form to extend my leave of absence.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Don't make much sense to be in an extracurricular squad if I get expelled.
But, I'll drop it if I can stay absent from school.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Turn this in yourself.
Why are you giving this to me?

Shinjiro Aragaki
You got a point there...
But, that'd end up being more of a pain than it's worth.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Goin' myself would be more of a pain than it's worth.
Plus, it seems like Kirijo depends on you.

Shinjiro Aragaki
It should be pretty easy to hand it off if you do it at school. I'll pay you back for this, so help me out, alright?

Minato Arisato - Selection
All right.
I'm against this.
Have you talked to Sanada?

Shinjiro Aragaki
......
So you'll do it, no questions asked? I owe you.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Happy - Not shy about speakin' your mind, huh?
I'm still gonna ask you, though. You're my best bet.

Shinjiro Aragaki
This has nothing to do with him.
Exasperated* - Besides, I already know what Aki would say...

Sanada's Voice
...Huh, I don't see you two together very often.

Akihiko Sanada
What're you guys doing back here in the middle of the day?

Akihiko Sanada
Surprised - Uh... That envelope...

Shinjiro Aragaki
Exasperated* - Tch...

Akihiko Sanada
...I'm guessing that's not the form for returning to school.
Happy - ......

Akihiko Sanada
Hey, Arisato.
If Shinji keeps this up, you'll be his classmates next year.
Happy - You and Junpei should practice addressing him casually. In fact, go ahead and boss him around a bit.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...I'd rather get expelled.
We're gonna finish the battle this year. I've got no reason to stay enrolled after that.

Akihiko Sanada
Very angry* - Shinji!

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - You know exactly how concerned Mitsuru is about you. You know what this form means to her, don't you?
Don't tell me you forgot your promise.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Sad - ......

Shinjiro Aragaki
...Sorry, Arisato.
Didn't wanna drag you into my problems, but... I'm still countin' on you for that.

Akihiko Sanada
...I've never seen Shinji ask someone else for help with his own problems before.
He'd never say it out loud, but I think he really trusts you.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Maybe.
Not as much as you, though.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Heh, even just being able to stand a guy that antisocial is an accomplishment.
Happy - I think he actually likes the fact that you don't back down from anyone.

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - I dunno. Yeah, we've know each other a long time...
Sad - But sometimes, being too close to somebody can have its drawbacks.

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - I'm not gonna nag Shinji about going back to school anymore.
Just do what you think is best. I'll leave it to you.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Sanada didn't say much on
the walk back to the dorm...
It feels like my 
improved after thinking about
what's on Aragaki's mind...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, it's you.
Sorry for surprising you. I had a feeling someone was in here, so I came to check...

Mitsuru Kirijo
What's that?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - ......
Surprised - Did you find this?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yes.
It was in his desk.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I see...
Sad - He made a habit of not leaving behind any personal belongings, but...
Sad - ......

Mitsuru Kirijo
...I have no idea when he filled out this form to return to school, or whether he even planned to hand it in.
But, I think this is proof that he was thinking about the promise we made.

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'm sure it is.
I wouldn't know.
I may have bothered him about it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Yes... He was so against it, and yet he still left this for us.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - Right... Maybe it's wishful thinking, but I'd like to believe he was.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I never knew his situation, and it's possible I just made things worse for him, but...
...I think if he knew we felt guilty, he'd just tell us to mind our own business.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I should show Akihiko... Or, actually...
Maybe I shouldn't. He probably wouldn't approve.
Let's just keep this between us for now.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Good idea.
That sounds like a pain.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Hah... It sounds like you know how to handle those two now.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Hah, I couldn't agree more. Sometimes, having so many stubborn teammates gives me a headache.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...Thanks to you, I was able to understand how he really felt.
Happy - I'll say this on behalf of all three of us: Thank you so much.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Here, you take this.
It should go to you, since you're the one who got him to open up.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Someday, once we leave this dorm... then I'll tell Akihiko.
Happy - I'll tell him about his struggle returning to this room, to fulfill the promise we made...
Happy - That he never forgot those days when it was just the three of us... Not even for a moment...

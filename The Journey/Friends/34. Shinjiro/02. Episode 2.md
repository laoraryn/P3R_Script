Shinjiro Aragaki   
......   
Let's go out, if you've got the time.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend the evening with Aragaki?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Spend time with Aragaki   
Not now   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Happy - I see.   
Come with me, then.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...I see.   
   
-----   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Two specials.   
   
Server   
Two specials, comin' right up!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
......   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
......   
What's wrong? Not hungry?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's not it.   
Why'd you bring me here?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...Alright, then.   
Well, you're still growing. You can handle at least one bowl of ramen.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
'Cause I said I'd treat you.   
I can't go back on my word. It's bad for my conscience.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That makes sense.   
You're so faithful.   
I forgot about that.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
I'm just keeping the promises I made, that's all...   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Exasperated* - ...That supposed to be a compliment?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Happy - Heh, sure you did.   
   
Server   
Here ya go, two specials!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Point is, you don't go back on your word. 'Specially when it comes to somethin' you promised.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
This looks delicious.   
Let's eat.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...Right, don't want the noodles to get soggy.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
I was thinkin', earlier... you really don't take any shit, even from your elders.   
I respect straightforwardness. Less trouble that way.   
Let's finish up and get the hell outta here.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Welcome back. Were you together?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Wait, Aragaki.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Have you considered returning to school at all?   
Sad - It's been some time since second semester started... Regarding your attendance, it'd be best if you went back as soon as possible.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
......   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You didn't turn in the paperwork?   
Having second thoughts?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...I got the paperwork, but I don't remember saying anything about turning it in.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
What's the point, anyhow? I got no business there.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Very angry* - Then why— Why did you come back here!?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Sad - ......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ...I apologize, it isn't my place to ask that.   
Looking away - Everything is my fault. I shouldn't have gotten you or Akihiko involved...   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Angry - Cut that out.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
I'm the one who chose to join you back then.   
However things turned out after that has nothin' to do with you.   
I didn't know what I was capable of... That's all there is to it.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - Then why are you so determined not to return to school?   
Angry - You'll be throwing your future away if you don't go back!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You can't force him.   
Calm down.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - R-Right...   
Sad - ...I apologize, I was out of line.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - I don't plan on forcing you into anything, like I did in the past.   
Sad - What's important is it's your own decision, Aragaki.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Tch...   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Looks like you have changed... just a little bit.   
You always used to avoid relying on people. Not so much of a lone wolf anymore, huh...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The only choice we have is to keep moving forward. That goes for myself, Akihiko... and you.   
Sad - So please, Aragaki, just give it another chance...   
   
Sanada's Voice   
What are you guys up to?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Looks like a pretty serious discussion.   
Happy - Lemme guess, Miss President is lecturing the delinquent on the importance of his education?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Akihiko...!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Exasperated* - Well, I'll be damned...   
Exasperated* - For a protein-fueled, musclebound moron, you're pretty smart.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - What was that!?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...See ya, Miss President. This delinquent's gonna go to his room and think about his bad choices.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - Wait, we're not finished yet!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - Akihiko. Why are you like this!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Uh... What just happened...? Was it something I said?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's nothing.   
Bad timing.   
Musclebound moron...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Ugh... Those two never change.   
Well, that's nothing new. They'll get over it eventually.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well, that's not my fault.   
It's nothing new. I'll just apologize later.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Wha—!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - H-Hey! What'd I even do!?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
......   
I feel like my  improved   
after hearing Aragaki's perspective...

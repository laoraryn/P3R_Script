Looks like Chidori still ain't back yet.
I get it's her own fault for runnin' off on her own, but she's still one of us, ya know.
Angry - We gotta help her, somehow...

Takaya
Don't be impatient, Jin.
If she hasn't yet freed herself, that must mean her Evoker was taken.

Takaya
Our first objective must be to retrieve it.
It would mean nothing to free Chidori without it.
For us, our Persona is as precious as our very lives.

Takaya
We should wait for an opportunity.
They've found their own navigator... Their own set of eyes.
Without Chidori, we'd only be playing into their hands.

Jin
...Yeah, you're right, Takaya.
Sorry, I lost my cool there for a second.

Jin
But, what are we gonna do?
They took down that Shadow during the last full moon like it was nothin'.
If they got someone who can predict our moves, it'll be hard to catch 'em off guard...

Takaya
...Yes, that's true.

Jin
By the way, what is that thing? It looks like some kinda clunky Evoker...

Takaya
This is one of the first Evokers ever developed. I suppose you could call it a prototype.
...Oh, that's right. You've never seen this before, have you, Jin?

Takaya
Happy - This was truly a terrible piece of work.
Happy - In exchange for drawing out the full extent of a Persona's latent power, the cost is that they become exceedingly difficult to control.
Happy - Especially for those who had their power... forced upon them, like ourselves.
Happy - To a Persona that has lost control, the user is but a shackle.
Happy - In those days, it was more commonplace to be killed by our own Personas than by the Shadows.
Happy - This was the result of one such killing.
Happy - "I am a shadow, the true self..." Regardless, I'm not one to dwell on the past.

Jin
So, that's why you don't use an Evoker...?

Takaya
Hardly. The real reason is far more practical.
I don't use one because I have no need. I don't require something as inelegant as a tool to prove my resolve.

Jin
Happy - You really are somethin' special, Takaya.

Takaya
Yet, there is always someone out there who is even greater. Such as... one who can wield multiple Personas...

Takaya
......
Am I feeling... attachment for someone...?
Happy - Haha... Impossible...

Takaya
Happy - ......
Happy - Heheh...
Very happy* - Hahaha!

Takaya
[cut 211 10 1]

Takaya
Very happy* - Ahahaha!

Jin
Takaya...?

Takaya
Very happy* - Ahhh...

Takaya
Such a thought is beneath me.

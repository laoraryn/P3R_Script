Suspicious-Looking Man   
You there...   
   
Suspicious-Looking Man   
You live in a world where emptiness roams and chaos reigns...   
You struggle so fervently, twinkling like stars in the night, but such delusion will not lead to deliverance.   
Why not join us and the Messiah, and await the moment of salvation?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
We still have time.   
I'm busy right now.   
   
Suspicious-Looking Man   
You say that only because you don't know the truth.   
Heed the voice of the Messiah, and follow the path to true salvation.   
   
Suspicious-Looking Man   
   
Suspicious-Looking Man   
Time will not wait.   
If you wish to hear the voice of the Messiah, you must make haste...   
   
Internal MES   
That suspicious man that preached to me   
is staring at me from over by the wall...   
Once he starts, it's probably going   
to take a while for him to finish...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Suspicious-Looking Man   
Now, go and speak to our savior.   
   
Takaya   
Happy - Well, well, well...   
I do believe this is the first time you've ever visited me.   
   
Takaya   
......   
I'm sure you are aware of the coming salvation.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
So I've heard.   
More like destruction.   
   
Takaya   
Yes, you certainly wouldn't be so stupid.   
   
Takaya   
I understand your perspective.   
   
Takaya   
I'm certain you've realized it by now.   
We have no further reason to be enemies.   
Your efforts were all for naught.   
The Dark Hour will persist, and Nyx will bring an end to this planet.   
Fate has been decided.   
   
Takaya   
But, there is no need to worry.   
We are simply being freed at last from the illusion of a future rife with betrayal.   
Nothing more, and nothing less.   
All you must do is embrace this truth...   
   
Takaya   
Do so, and I shall be your shepherd.   
   
Takaya   
......   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
This fight's just begun.   
We're not giving up yet.   
We're going to save people.   
   
Takaya   
Happy - Heheheh...   
Happy - Ah, but of course. That's just the kind of person you are.   
   
Takaya   
Happy - Heheheh...   
Happy - Ah, but of course. That's just the kind of person you are.   
And the means by which you deign to "save" everyone are quite different from my own, I'd imagine.   
   
Takaya   
......   
So then, you intend to fight Nyx?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Fight and win.   
We'll do whatever we can.   
   
Takaya   
...I see.   
   
Takaya   
I scorn those who preach about the future with improvidence.   
The world does not need a script that is already written...   
Nor does it want for charlatans who speak as though the future can be seized.   
What it needs is for the curtain to fall.   
   
Takaya   
"If I just endure for now"... "If I can wait until tomorrow"...   
These blind hopes for the future are the root of the people's suffering.   
They can never be saved, because they look to a future that doesn't exist.   
   
Takaya   
It doesn't matter whether you can defeat Nyx or not.   
Why, you ask?   
   
Takaya   
Because you won't even be able to reach her.   
   
Takaya   
On the day of salvation, I will wait atop the Tower of Demise for Nyx to arrive.   
   
Takaya   
And be warned.   
If you dare to oppose me, I will show no mercy.

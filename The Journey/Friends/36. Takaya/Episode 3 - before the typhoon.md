Takaya
This is the first time we've met during the day.
Let's have a chat while the opportunity presents itself.

Minato Arisato - Selection
But we're enemies.
What about the typhoon?

Takaya
That doesn't concern me. Now, let's be off.

===============================================================================================

Takaya
I understand one of my group has caused you some trouble.
Is she in good health?
It must be difficult looking after her. After all, you likely can't rein her in for very long...
Or, could it be you've already killed her?

Minato Arisato - Selection
She's fine, for now.
We don't kill people.

Takaya
I see. "For now," you say...
Then, I assume her symptoms have arisen?
Considering Kirijo's resourcefulness, you would have had access to the suppressants as well.

Takaya
So, you're keeping her alive.
Then, I take it you've had to use the suppressants.
As I'd expect from Kirijo's resourcefulness. And, you now have someone with firsthand experience among your number as well...

Takaya
If you already know about the suppressants, that simplifies things.
Can you imagine it? A Persona-user, murdered by their other half...
Such is the fate of a Persona that has gone berserk.

Takaya
...As you have already seen for yourself.

Takaya
This power of ours is not meant to be wielded by just anyone.
That holds true, even for those who were awakened by force...
It comes at a great cost, and we can only harness it by walking the line between life and death. This power makes us who we are.

Takaya
And yet... you hold the ability to wield so many.
The Dark Hour has graced you with its favor. Almost unjustly so, from our perspective.
......

Takaya
Now, I ask you.
Don't you think it'd be a shame for you to lose such a special power?

Minato Arisato - Selection
It's for my friends.
It's for the sake of the world.

Takaya
You stubbornly cling to that sentiment...
Do you have no intention of understanding anything?
Choosing to turn a blind eye towards your own power, to the grief of the fallen, the unchosen, the unloved...

Takaya
Angry - Such apathy... Such insolence... You trample upon everything we stand for!
Angry - And worst of all, your rejection of my—


Takaya
......
You tread upon your gifts like dirt, and in doing so, reveal your own arrogance...
It disgusts me.

Takaya
I see now that nothing will change your mind.
If our beliefs are at odds with each other, and neither side is willing to concede...

Takaya
Then a battle is unavoidable.

Takaya
......

Takaya
Our final confrontation will come in our own time.

Takaya
You have been blessed with a power greater than any other, and yet you don't see its true value...
...Such a shame.

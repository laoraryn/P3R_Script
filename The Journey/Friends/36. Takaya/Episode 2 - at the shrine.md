Koromaru
*whine*

Aigis
No.

Koromaru
Sad - *whine*

Aigis
No means no.

Minato Arisato - Selection
What's wrong?
No what?

Aigis
I am currently negotiating with Koromaru-san.
Koromaru-san is prohibited from going out for a walk on his own.

Aigis
It is time for Koromaru-san's solo patrol duty.
Commonly known as a "walk."

Aigis
There were arrangements for Sanada-san to accompany Koromaru-san on his walk today.
However, the scheduled time has passed, and Sanada-san has yet to return.
Koromaru-san's patience has reached its limit.

Koromaru
......

Koromaru
Arf!

Aigis
Koromaru-san is requesting that Minato-san accompany him, instead.
Are you available to assist at the moment, Minato-san?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I am. Perfect timing.
What about you, Aigis?

Aigis
You are what they call a "lifesaver."

Aigis
My current mission is to remain on standby at the dormitory.
I'm afraid I'm fully occupied at the moment.
I must also request your assistance, Minato-san.

Koromaru
Arf! Arf!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Koromaru and I left the
dorm to go for a walk.

===============================================================================================



Koromaru
*pant* *pant*
...?

Koromaru
Angry - Grrrr...

Intimidating Voice
A non-human Persona-user... Now that is certainly unique.

Takaya
However, my fascination lies more with you.

Takaya
Good evening.
There's no need for hostility. Now is hardly the time.
Let's have a little chat.
Come along.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
He doesn't seem to be hostile.
What should I do...?

Koromaru
......

Takaya
What exactly are you waiting for?

===============================================================================================



Takaya
Now then, I have a question for you.

Takaya
However, just demanding answers from you wouldn't be a very fair arrangement now, would it?
I will answer one question of your own, first.

Takaya
So, what do you want to know?

Minato Arisato - Selection
What's your goal?
Why are you getting in our way?
Why aren't you wearing a top?

Takaya
We don't serve any particular grand purpose.
Had you simply stayed your hands, we could have avoided a needless confrontation.

Takaya
Surprised - That is a strange way of seeing it...
From our perspective, you are the ones getting in our way.

Takaya
My coat is invisible to fools.

Takaya
Happy - ...But, of course, I'm joking.
Happy - What a surprise, that you would rather ask about me, instead of our group.

Takaya
Happy - Perhaps this is a sign that we may reach a mutual understanding.

Takaya
In the beginning, we had no quarrel with you.
Had you not decided to eliminate the Dark Hour, we wouldn't have had a reason to interfere...

Takaya
Hurt - It is truly unfathomable.
Hurt - The power of a Persona is a blessing granted only to us.

Takaya
Hurt - Yet, you insist on ending the Dark Hour, knowing full well that your powers will be lost...
Now, answer me this: Why?

Takaya
Are you trying to protect the world from the Shadows?

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's right.
I can't just ignore them.

Takaya
And, just where did you come up with that idea?

Takaya
Is that truly how you feel?

Takaya
In this country, almost 5000 people die in car accidents every year.
And yet, there is no outcry against the existence of cars. Why do you suppose that is?

Takaya
It is because we value our own convenience over the lives of others.
So then, why should we give up the powers we were bestowed?

Minato Arisato - Selection
That logic makes no sense.
......

Takaya
Do you know what a "savior complex" is?

Takaya
You are being trapped by a misguided way of thinking.
We have no obligation to sacrifice what is ours to save others.

Takaya
Giving up your own life to save others is simply a waste.
Your reason for fighting is one of obsession.

Minato Arisato - Selection
You're wrong.
Maybe you're right.

Takaya
Happy - Do you continue to deny it because you can't accept the truth?

Takaya
Happy - There is no need to rush your decision. You should think carefully about it.

Koromaru
Angry - Arf!

Takaya
Happy - Your dog doesn't seem to like your answer.
Happy - However, self-reflection is a good habit. You should think carefully about it.

Takaya
We have been given a special power, and yours... Yours is particularly extraordinary.
It's as if the Dark Hour has chosen you.

Takaya
Does it really make sense for you to reject this gift?

Takaya
That was all I had to say.
Tonight is a new moon. You have ample time to reconsider before the moon waxes full again.

Takaya
With that, my debt to you is paid.
Perhaps it might help you make up your mind...

Takaya
Happy - Well then, I shall be going...
Happy - I trust you'll have changed your tune by the next time we meet.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's a folded up piece of paper.
There's something written on it...

Koromaru
Arf!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I returned to the dorm and
reported what happened.

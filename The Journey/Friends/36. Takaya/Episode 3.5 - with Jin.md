Jin
There somethin' worth lookin' at from here?

Takaya
The moon is almost perfect.

Jin
It'll be full in just three more days.

Takaya
So it would seem.

Takaya
I have no intention of relinquishing my abilities and living an empty life.
To continue existing as we are, or to die powerless...

Jin
I hear ya.
I know how important this is to you, Takaya—to us.
We can't afford to lose it.
Sad - And besides...

Takaya
...Jin?

Jin
Sad - If the Dark Hour disappears, we might forget everything that happened, won't we?
Sad - I'd forget you and Chidori, the things we did together, our time at the facility... All of it.
Sad - To me, that's a fate worse than death.

Jin
Angry - I couldn't care less if that damned facility got erased from my memory.
Angry - Havin' this uncontrollable power forced on us... Watchin' everybody we knew disappear one by one...

Jin
But there's just one thing I refuse to forget.
Back when I was trapped in that living hell, you spoke to me...

Jin
Thanks to what you said, I learned how to keep myself going.
Your words gave my life meaning, Takaya.
If I forget that, I won't have any reason to be alive.

Takaya
......

Jin
It may not be much of a purpose, compared to yours...
It was just a couple of words, I know. But...
They meant the whole world to me.

Jin
Happy - So I can't lose this fight, either.

Takaya
Is that so...?

Jin
......

Takaya
Well then, why don't we find out together?
Whom will fate elect to choose... them, or us?

Jin
Happy - ...!?
Happy - ...Right!

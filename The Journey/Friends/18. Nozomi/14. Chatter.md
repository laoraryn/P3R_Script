Nom nom nom... Nom nom...   
   
Chubby Student   
...Hm? What? What do you want?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What are you eating?   
Nothing.   
   
Chubby Student   
Angry - ...Why's it matter?   
Once I'm done with this sandwich, I have so many other restaurants to visit...   
Ahhh, I'm sooo busy...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This must be the "Gourmet King"   
Tomochika mentioned...   
He certainly seems to know his   
way around the restaurants here.   
Maybe I don't have as much   
 as his sandwich...   
I probably need to be at least   
 to get his attention.   
   
Chubby Student   
Oh, all right... Nom nom...   
   
Chubby Student   
Nom nom nom... Hm?   
Sad - Wh-What? Don't look at me while I'm eating.   
Sad - You're making me feel self-conscious!   
Sad - I can't savor the flavor of my gourmet sandwich, only available for a limited time, with you here.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It looks like I have enough   
 to catch his attention.   
   
Chubby Student   
...What do you want?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What are you eating?   
Nothing.   
   
Chubby Student   
Oh, you're curious? Do you fancy yourself a gourmet?   
Angry - Is that even possible? An unrefined guy like you? I think not. You'll have to prove it.   
   
Chubby Student   
Happy - If you can pass my Gourmet Quiz, then I'll believe you.   
Hmm, what should I ask...? I don't want to make it too difficult.   
Give me some time to think... Nom nom...   
   
Chubby Student   
Hmph, suit yourself. Nom nom...   
   
Chubby Student   
Angry - *gulp*   
Whew... What a sandwich.   
Now, the quiz begins. This first question is a freebie.   
What's the most popular drink at the café over there?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Earl Grey.   
Hot cocoa with soy.   
Pheromone Coffee.   
I need to prep...   
   
Chubby Student   
Happy - ...Correct.   
   
Chubby Student   
Bzzt. Wrong. Sorry.   
   
Chubby Student   
Here's question number two.   
What color skirt does Azuki Arai's mascot, Azuki-chan, wear?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Blue.   
Green.   
Red.   
I need to prep...   
   
Chubby Student   
Happy - Hm... You're pretty good.   
   
Chubby Student   
Bzzt. Wrong. Sorry.   
   
Chubby Student   
Question three: What item is on the secret menu at Hagakure?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Hagakure Dumplings.   
Hagakure Bowl.   
There's no such thing.   
I need to prep...   
   
Chubby Student   
Happy - ...I'm impressed.   
   
Chubby Student   
Bzzt. Wrong. Sorry.   
   
Chubby Student   
You seem to have some knowledge about food. But it pales in comparison to mine!   
Why don't you bring me something I've never eaten before? It'd have to be quite the odd morsel to fit that bill though.   
If you succeed, then I'll accept you as a fellow gourmet.   
   
Chubby Student   
Surprised - Hm!? Wh-What is that mysterious food!?   
Surprised - G-Give it to me!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
He took my .   
   
Chubby Student   
Ughhh... This is... awful!   
Happy - But I'm impressed. I haven't tasted something like that in all my life...   
Happy - You're not so bad.   
   
Chubby Student   
*munch* *munch* *burp* Oh, it's you.   
Would you care to join me for some food? I do owe you for the food you brought me.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It seems like he's taken an interest in me...   
Should I hang out with him for the day?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Spend time with him   
Not now   
   
Chubby Student   
Oh, fine. Ahhh, I'm starving...   
   
Chubby Student   
Have you found something I've never eaten before? My stomach is growling.   
And just so you know, buying something from one of the places around here isn't gonna cut it.   
It has to be something otherworldly by my gourmet standards... assuming such a thing even exists in this world.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
What type of food has he   
never eaten before...?   
   
Chubby Student   
Nom nom nom... *burp*   
I don't feel like giving you a quiz anymore. Come back some other time.   
   
Chubby Student   
*munch* *munch* *burp* Oh, it's you.   
You're so persistent. Are you here to challenge the Gourmet King again?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Of course.   
No thanks.   
   
Chubby Student   
Happy - Then, prepare yourself!   
   
Chubby Student   
Oh, okay. Then bye-bye. Nom nom...   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
*munch* *munch* *burp* Hey, Arisato-kun.   
Happy - Perfect timing. Do you want to go get something to eat? I can hear my poor stomach crying sadly.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
*munch* *munch* *burp* Hey, Arisato-kun.   
...Wondering about my clothes?   
Well, you see, the reason I wear our school uniform is...   
......   
Angry - It's hard to find something that'll fit!   
......   
Happy - Anyway, want to go for a bite somewhere? My poor stomach has been crying for a while.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend some time   
after school with Suemitsu?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend the day with Suemitsu?

Nozomi Suemitsu   
Sad - Awww, but I would've taken you on a culinary adventure!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
*gulp* *munch* *munch* Ah, yes.   
Happy - Perfect timing. Do you want to go get something to eat? I can hear my poor stomach crying sadly.

Happy - So, want to go get something to eat? I can hear my poor stomach crying sadly.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Angry - Nom nom... Phew! Exams are finally over. Now to celebrate with some food!   
Happy - Every hour spent testing felt like torture! I need some brain food! Nom nom...   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Were you also in pain during exam week, Arisato-kun? A gourmand's gotta eat, after all.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
*gulp* Ah, right.   
Happy - Perfect timing. Do you want to go get something to eat? I can hear my poor stomach crying sadly.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Angry - Wonderful, my gourmet friend. Let us set forth on our culinary adventure!   
Happy - Today, we'll have some delightfully juicy meat at the strip mall that's practically exploding with flavor... And that can only mean one place.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
*munch* *munch* *burp* Oh, hey, Minato-kun.   
Happy - Perfect timing. Do you want to go get something to eat? I can hear my poor stomach crying in anguish.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
*munch* *munch* *burp* Ah, right.

Nozomi Suemitsu   
Angry - Wonderful, my gourmet friend! Let's see... Last time, we ascended to a juicy paradise, yes?   
Happy - I know just where to go next.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
*munch* *munch* *burp* Hey there, Minato-kun.   
Happy - Perfect timing. Do you want to go get something to eat? I can hear my poor stomach crying miserably.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
*munch* *munch* *burp* Ah, right.   
Happy - Perfect timing. Do you want to go get something to eat? I can hear my poor stomach crying miserably.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Angry - Wonderful, my gourmet friend! Our culinary adventure continues!   
Happy - Today, we'll be going to Wakatsu. There's something for everyone on that menu.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
*munch* *munch* *burp* Well, if it isn't Minato-kun.   
Happy - Perfect timing. Do you want to get something to eat? I can hear my poor stomach screaming for attention.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
*munch* *munch* *burp* Ah, right.   
Happy - Perfect timing. Do you want to get something to eat? I can hear my poor stomach screaming for attention.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Angry - Wonderful, my gourmet friend!   
Happy - What are you in the mood for today? Rice? Sandwiches? Or maybe noodles? I know just the place!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Angry - *munch* *munch* *burp* Ahhh, you're finally here, Minato-kun!   
Sad - D-Do you want to go get something to eat? I can hear my poor stomach crying woefully.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Angry - *munch* *munch* *burp* Ahhh!   
Sad - D-Do you want to go get something to eat? I can hear my poor stomach crying woefully.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Happy - Wonderful, my gourmet friend. I knew I could count on you, Minato-kun.   
Happy - And today's main course... is seafood soup! And I know just the place for it.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
*munch* *munch* *burp* Oh, hey, Minato-kun.   
Happy - Wanna grab a bite somewhere? I can hear my stomach crying out with a vengeance.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
*munch* *munch* *burp* Oh, right.   
Happy - Wanna grab a bite somewhere? I can hear my stomach crying out with a vengeance.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Angry - Wonderful, my gourmet friend!   
To be honest... I needed to talk to you today.   
Happy - So we need a spot where we can eat good meat and chat. And I know just the place!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
*munch* *munch* *burp* Oh, Minato-kun.   
Sad - Could you hear me out? My stomach is crying in sorrow, but that's not important right now...   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
*munch* *munch* *burp* Um, so...   
Sad - Could you hear me out? My stomach is crying in sorrow, but that's not important right now...   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Happy - Wonderful, my gourmet fr—   
   
Sad - Er, no. I'm not here to eat today. I'm here because I wanted to talk to you...   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
*munch* *munch* *burp* Oh, Minato-kun!   
Happy - I've been waiting for you. I can hear my stomach wailing in agony.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
*munch* *munch* *burp* Oh, right.   
Happy - I've been waiting for you. I can hear my stomach wailing in agony.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Angry - Wonderful, my gourmet friend!   
Happy - First, I have some excellent news to share! Then, afterwards, hm... Oh, I know just the place!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Sad - Oh, Minato-kun...   
Sad - H-Hey, uhhh, um, uh, ummm, s-so...   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Sad - H-Hey, uhhh, um, uh, ummm, s-so...   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Surprised - R-Really!?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I don't think there's anything I can do...   
Maybe I'll try talking to him another day.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Sad - Awww, but we could've gone on a culinary adventure together!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Sad - Awww, but we could've gone on a culinary adventure together!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Sad - Awww, but we were supposed to go on a culinary adventure!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Angry - Whuh!? Then how are we supposed to go on a culinary adventure!?   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Sad - Awww... I wanted to go on a culinary adventure with you though.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Sad - Oh... Guess our culinary adventure will have to wait, then.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Sad - Whuh...!? Are you saying, if the food isn't delicious, you won't partake on a culinary adventure!?   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Sad - What!? But I was all ready to take you on a culinary adventure!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Sad - O-Oh... It's okay, I get it...   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Well, look who we have here. Is the Kyoto cuisine to your liking, Arisato-kun?   
Honestly speaking, I have little interest in the plant-based fare they have going on here.   
I sampled the food the souvenir shop had to offer, but I find myself unimpressed...   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
...Looks like you're still wet behind the ears.   
Listen closely, all right? No gourmet worth their salt would be caught wearing a yukata.   
We eat!   
Our belly expands!   
The sash gets too tight!   
So we loosen it!   
Then we eat some more!   
We loosen the sash more!   
The sash falls off!   
We're left in the nude!   
You follow me?   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
You're stark naked, and your belly's all cold. Now, that's a real emergency.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Oh, it's you!   
I've been debating what to eat next.   
So far I've had senbei, nama-yatsuhashi, more nama-yatsuhashi, senmaizuke...   
Then more nama-yatsuhashi, senbei again, and senbei again... Now what?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Nama-yatsuhashi.   
Senmaizuke.   
Just eat whatever you want.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Ah, yes, the raw, unbaked confectionery! Getting dessert next does make the most logical sense.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Ah, yes! One thousand slices— Hm, that's quite a lot, isn't it? Still, I shall attempt the thousand pickle challenge!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
What!? You're making me decide!? How could I, lost in this state of hunger...? Hmmm.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Too much of a good thing can be a bad thing—and that goes for Kyoto's healthy cuisine, too. Now that's deep...   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
The local food in Kyoto might be healthy, but that matters little when eating in excess...

Nozomi Suemitsu
What I'm about to tell you is top secret. This is for your ears only, okay?

Nozomi Suemitsu
This world is gonna end soon. All of humanity is gonna be completely wiped out.
Happy - But don't worry! We'll be re-creating it as a new land for the survivors—Paradise!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - Well? Did that just blow your mind?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, I'm freaking out.
Not really.
The world is ending?

Nozomi Suemitsu
Angry - Well, don't wet your pants or anything! I'm trying to eat a hamburger here.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - But it's all right. I forgive you.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Surprised - Wow, Minato-kun. I need to be more like you.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Sad - When I first found out about this, I had to change my pants afterward.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Surprised - H-Hey! Not so loud, Minato-kun!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Surprised - I told you, it's top secret! We don't wanna start a mass panic.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - In Paradise, everyone has wings and perfect figures... and they smell like flowers.
Happy - I... I can finally be reborn into a worthwhile body!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Sad - But if we don't do something, you'll get left behind when the world ends.
Sad - And I do not want that to happen! So c'mon—we'll go to Paradise together!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Sad - Don't do it because you're my subject, okay!? Do it because we're... friends.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I get the feeling Suemitsu
considers me a good friend.
I feel like our relationship is stronger...

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - Okay, so how about this...?
Happy - If we factor in initiation fees, scriptures, and other products... Uhh... It comes out to 132,000 yen! You can take out a loan, right?

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - Not to mention you'll get a discount since I'll be referring you, too. You are one lucky guy!

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's insane!
No way I'm paying that.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Surprised - I-Insane!? YOU'RE the insane one, with that sinful mouth of yours!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Angry - I just wanted to share eternal happiness with you because I care about your soul!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Surprised - Y-You what...? Do you have any idea what you're saying!?

Nozomi Suemitsu
Angry - I just wanted to share eternal happiness with you because I care about your soul!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Surprised - I have to go repent on your behalf! In the name of faith—emergency!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
...I decided to go back to the dorm.

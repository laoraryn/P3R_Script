We go to the same school, right? One look at your uniform's all I need to know!

Chubby Student
Sad - Umm, I'm kind of embarrassed to ask you this right off the bat, but...

Chubby Student
Angry - Would you mind not standing so close to me!? You're too thin and too cool!
Angry - If people start thinking we're best friends or something, I'm gonna end up as "the uncool one"!

Bitter-Looking Man
There you are. I thought your voice sounded familiar.
You know what I'm here for. Now hand it over.

Chubby Student
Surprised - Wh-Whoa! Not you!

Chubby Student
Surprised - H-Help! E-Emergency!
Surprised - H-Hey! Y-You! Call the fire truck— Er, I mean the, uh... Uh...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Call the police?
Sorry, what?

Chubby Student
Surprised - Yes! Right! Good thinking!

Chubby Student
Sad - Whoa, hey... I thought we were buddies, weren't we? C'mon, pal!

Bitter-Looking Man
Quit making a scene, all right? People are looking at me funny.
I've got some business to take care of now, but you... You're Nozomi Suemitsu-kun, aren't you? I did my homework, see.
You know I'm not letting you off that easy, right? I suggest you reconsider things.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Sad - That was horrifying! My poor heart! I think it dropped into my coin purse for a minute there!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - My name is Nozomi Suemitsu!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - By the way! May I just say that you have a wonderfully big heart for someone so slim?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Suemitsu gave me a hearty thanks.
I've become acquainted with
Nozomi Suemitsu, the Gourmet King.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Whew, all that drama made me hungry. My stomach is definitely not amused.
You wanna tag along, friend? Shall I treat you to the finest dining? If so, you've come to the right place...

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - For I am the king—the Gourmet King!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - That's right! Gourmet King 2009! ...Or was it 2010? Eh, whatever.

Nozomi Suemitsu
And as the king, I know all the kingliest places for... Ugh... Urrgh!?

Nozomi Suemitsu
Hurt - Wha—!? My... My tummy...! It's in horrible pain! I think it's an... e-emergency...!
Hurt - Sorry, but I'll treat you... another time!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It started getting dark, so I went home.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - Heeey, Minato-kun!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - I did it! I finally met my quota! I found someone else to welcome into our flock!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - ...Oh! Speak of the devil!

Familiar Young Man
......

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - Oh, wow! Are you interested in joining, too!?
Surprised - Finally, Paradise is smiling back at me! Yes! Yesss!

Minato Arisato - Selection
You're gonna scam them, too?
Just knock it off.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Sad - "Scam"? I don't know what you're talking about...

Nozomi Suemitsu
Angry - I'm trying to save these people! They've suffered in this world, just like me!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Sad - Wh-What are you saying? That I should just abandon these people to their fate!?

Nozomi Suemitsu
Angry - I'm trying to save these people! They've suffered in this world, just like me!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Angry - Someone as good-looking as you could never understand! You have no idea what people like me have to go through...
Angry - Fine. If you're gonna try and stop me... then... then you and I are through!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Sad - Don't follow me around anymore! Only true believers are allowed into Paradise!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
That new recruit seemed familiar...
I'm worried about Suemitsu.
I better follow him.

===============================================================================================

Nozomi Suemitsu
Huh? Wh-What is this?

Nozomi Suemitsu
Surprised - Is this... an emergency!? A serious emergency!?

Bitter-Looking Man
So the world's coming to an end, huh? I think I remember some other cult saying stuff like that.

Bitter-Looking Man
Except they really weren't about "initiation fees." It was more about giving up material wealth, wasn't it?
Stealing ideas from real, actual religions... That's a textbook cult tactic, you know.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Surprised - Y-You mean... this was all a trick!?

Bitter-Looking Man
Oh yeah, you've been duped, kid.
But not by us. You should blame that cult you believe in so much.
Now that I know the truth, I almost feel sorry for you. But you had to take things too far.

Bitter-Looking Man
Try not to hit his face. If you leave any marks, he might be able to press charges.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Tearing up - Ah! Ahhh... *sob* Am I... Am I gonna die?

Nozomi Suemitsu
Tearing up - B-But if I die here... I'll be reborn, and I can go to Paradise!
Tearing up - I-I'm not scared! I'm not scared!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Surprised - Wha— Minato-kun!?
Surprised - Wh-What are you doing here? After I said such awful things to you... That we were through...

Nozomi Suemitsu
Tearing up - I-I'm freaking out! *sob* I don't want them to hurt me!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Suemitsu really trusts me with all his heart.
I feel like our relationship is stronger...

Nozomi Suemitsu
Tearing up - I'm sorry, Minato-kun! I'm so sorry!

Thug
Gross, dude! You're getting snot everywhere!

Thug
Screw this. I gotta get to work.

Bitter-Looking Man
I've had just about enough of this.
Look, just forget about the money. But I don't ever want to see you near my son again.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Tearing up - You're so wonderful, Minato-kun... You have such a kind soul!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I took Suemitsu home and
went back to the dorm.

Happy - You have a pretty good appetite. You even kept up with me... Hurp.
Happy - How do you stay so thin, though? Looks really are deceiving, aren't they!?

Nozomi Suemitsu
Sad - But that means there are people out there who secretly want to take my title as Gourmet King! ...Eh, maybe.
Sad - Actually, remember that puny middle-aged guy from the other day!? I bet he was an assassin! ...Maybe.

Nozomi Suemitsu
There's nothing I can do about it right now, but I'll show them soon enough! Just you wait.
In light of your recent achievements and your courageous appetite, I hereby appoint you to the Gourmet King's royal guard!

Nozomi Suemitsu
No, maybe that's too much of a burden for you to bear.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Suemitsu really seems to trust me.
I feel like our relationship is stronger...

Nozomi Suemitsu
By the way, you're a second-year, right, Minato-kun? So you're one year below me...
Happy - It kind of feels like I have a younger brother now.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Well? Would you wanna be... my younger brother?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure, why not.
Not really, no.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Sad - You do sort of look like him... No, that's impossible.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Sure, fine, whatever. I just thought you looked like someone is all, but I was wrong! You look nothing like him!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Sad - Whew, I knew this would happen! I always get hungry if I think about the past too hard.
Sad - And I just filled up on that beef bowl, too...

Nozomi Suemitsu
Better stay true to form and keep eating, huh?

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - Here's to a healthy appetite courtesy of remembering the past! The ol' memory rewind!
Happy - All right, now in reverse—let's moonwalk!

Nozomi Suemitsu
What are you doing, Minato-kun? You're my royal guard. You have to join me.
Happy - Now, do as I do.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - Moonwalk into Umiushi!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I tagged along with Suemitsu
and had another beef bowl.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After eating, I parted ways with
Suemitsu and went back to the dorm.

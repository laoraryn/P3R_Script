Nozomi Suemitsu
So for lunch, I had a melon-pan, then a katsu sandwich...

Nozomi Suemitsu
Then an age-pan, a kani-pan, a yakisoba-pan, apple strudel... another age-pan...
Happy - But I gotta have my rice, too!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Surprised - Argh... Urp! I... I think that might've been... too many carbs!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Today, a girl in my class asked me, "Who's that cute guy you went to Umiushi with?"
Sad - She wanted me to introduce you two so you could eat lunch together... without me.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Sad - Girls always go for guys like you... or my little brother. I guess looks really are everything.
But once we're dead, we'll all just be bones. You can't tell a handsome skeleton from an ugly one.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Angry - Arrgh, not again! Why do my memories make me so damn hungry!?

Nozomi Suemitsu
Hey, waiter! Another tonkatsu special!

Nozomi Suemitsu
While we wait for the food, let me share a little senryu poem I wrote.
Happy - He who cuts you is no friend,
But he who katsu you,
Flavor until the end.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Hurt - Huh? Oh... Oogh... My... My stomach! Emergency!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Sad - Whew... That was way too close. If that toilet was just a bit further away... Ohhhh, boy.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Did you eat too much?
Are you feeling sick?

Nozomi Suemitsu
Hey, don't you know who I am? I'm the Gourmet King. I can handle way more than any average stomach.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Sad - In case you haven't noticed by now, I usually always have room for fried food.

Nozomi Suemitsu
No, I'm fine, no worries.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - Everything's good and normal over here. Except for my weight, that is.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Surprised - ...Ah! The Gourmet King shouldn't say things like that. I didn't mean to be so crass!
Surprised - I mean, who wants to talk about toilets while they're eating? Gah, I keep saying "toilet"! Sorry, sorry.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can tell Suemitsu's trying
to be considerate of me.
I feel like our relationship is stronger...

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - Okay, enough of that! Let's shovel that food down!
Happy - We have to eat every chance we get! Because once we're dead, all we'll be eating is dust!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - You know, just like my little brother!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After eating with Suemitsu,
I went back to the dorm.

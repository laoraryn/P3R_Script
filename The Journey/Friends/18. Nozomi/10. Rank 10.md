Nozomi Suemitsu   
Sad - Hey, um... So, about last time. Uh...   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Happy - L-Let's go to Hagakure!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The restaurant is filled with   
the familiar smell of fish.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Sad - My younger brother and I were twins, but not the kind that look the same. He was the better-looking one.   
Sad - Everyone called me "the uglier Suemitsu." They always compared me to him... And I could never beat him at anything.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Sad - There was a time when I used to hit him for no reason. But even then, he still treated me like a brother.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Sad - Then in middle school, we bought steamed buns... and then he died. Food poisoning.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Sad - They said the meat was undercooked. Just his bun, though. Not mine.   
Sad - But I couldn't even cry. I actually felt... relieved. I thought, "Maybe they'll all finally stop laughing at me."   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's terrible.   
That's understandable.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Sad - What kind of person feels joy when their own brother dies? I'm such a... I'm a...   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Sad - Thanks, but... I know already. I was a terrible brother.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Sad - At first, I tried to be more like him. I went to cram schools and did martial arts and everything.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Sad - But I could never be as good, and eventually... I started to feel like people were laughing at me.   
Sad - The only time I feel safe is when I'm eating. All that matters is what's in front of me, and everything else melts away.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Sad - See? That's what the Gourmet King really is. I only eat to run away from my problems.   
Sad - But if I keep this up, I'll never be able to replace my brother, will I?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Just be yourself.   
You're irreplaceable.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Be myself...? Be myself!?   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
You don't think... anyone could replace me!?   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Is that really how it is?   
......   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
I hear you!   
Happy - You're right! I can never be like my brother! We're two different people!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Happy - How did I miss something so obvious? Haha, I can be pretty dumb sometimes.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Happy - Thank you, Minato-kun. Really, thank you so much.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Suemitsu truly appreciates me.   
I feel like our relationship is stronger...

The Moon Social Link reached its maximum level! You can now fuse **Sandalphon**, the deliverer of prayers!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Happy - Oh, I know this is sudden, but I'm relieving you of your duties as the Gourmet King's royal guard. You're fired.   
Happy - ...Because you're the new king. All hail Gourmet King II!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
DEV: Unused   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Happy - The restaurants in the strip mall gave this to me because of how often I eat there.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Happy - I feel like I've been fake all this time. But one day, I will become the true Gourmet King!   
Happy - I think I'll become a food critic. It'll be my job to eat—I'm gonna become a food master!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Then when I die and go to the afterlife, I can face my brother.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Happy - And then I can tell him I was the best at something for once in my life!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Happy - So until I reclaim my crown, you can hang on to it.   
Happy - I may have lost my title, but someday, I'll make my grand return as Gourmet King III!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Happy - That's my promise to you... and to my little brother.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Huh? I've been talking so much about my brother, but... I'm okay! My memories didn't make me sad and hungry this time!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Happy - Oh, wow... I never realized how good the ramen tastes here!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
After Suemitsu finished bowl after bowl   
of ramen, I went back to the dorm.

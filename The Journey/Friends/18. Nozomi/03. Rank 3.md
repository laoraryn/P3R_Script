The restaurant is filled with
the familiar smell of fish.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - That enough appetizers?

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - 'Scuse me, sir! Two bowls of the usual today! And as always, make sure one of 'em is extra large!

Ramen Shop Owner
...Comin' right up.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Our bowls were replaced
with two new, fresh ones.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - Once you taste this, my friend, there is no going back.
Happy - Tan-Tan-Tan Noodles! Yes! That's three—count 'em—three Tans!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - This is the crown jewel of the secret menu here—even better than the Hagakure Bowl!
Happy - The simple, salt-based broth, complemented by the rich, spicy miso sauce... It's like a microcosm of the miracle of creation!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Wow!
The incredible flavor
melts away my troubles!

Nozomi Suemitsu
It's all about that secret menu! Although... how will people find it if it's too secret?
Happy - Ah, whatever. The harder I think about it, the hungrier I'm gonna get.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Oh, sir! Don't toss out that first bowl, all right? That soup and I have unfinished business!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - This is a huge honor for you, you know. You're only the second person to taste this after me.
Happy - Don't forget to blow on the noodles to cool them off.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can really feel Suemitsu's kindness.
I feel like our relationship is stronger...

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - What a lucky guy you are. I mean, you get to be friends with me!
Sad - And just so you know, you wouldn't be getting this with my younger brother, because the Gourmet King's brother is not the Gourmet King!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - So? Do you "get me," hm? Who am I? Go on, I wanna hear it come out of your mouth!

Minato Arisato - Selection
Nozomi Suemitsu.
The Gourmet King.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Sad - Uh, well... Yeah, I guess that's true... All looks and no brains, huh?

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - My word, not so loud! Are you trying to embarrass me? Here, have some of my boiled egg. I had a couple of bites, but it's still good!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Surprised - Ack! No more talking! The food's gonna be a chewy, flavorless mess if we don't eat up!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Angry - Sir! Sir! You saved that first bowl, right? 'Cause I'm gonna be needing it!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Suemitsu and I finished our ramen,
and I went back to the dorm.

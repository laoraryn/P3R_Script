Nozomi Suemitsu
Angry - Hey, I haven't been doing so well lately, you know. And it's all because of your blasphemy!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Sad - I begged so hard for your soul that I think I actually lost weight.
Sad - Look at me! I'm paper-thin now!

Minato Arisato - Selection
You do look thinner.
No, you're not.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Oh, you really think so? I ate the same amount of food, though.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Happy - Damn straight! I could down a ham katsu in my sleep if I really wanted to!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Sad - I get what you're trying to say... You're embarrassed to be seen with me, right?
Sad - I'm not like my little brother. I'm not smart or athletic, and I have weird, stubby legs.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Sad - And my pants are covered with food stains.

Nozomi Suemitsu
Angry - I'm just a thorn in everyone's side! They all wish I could be more like my little brother.
Angry - All they do is make fun of me! I just want this whole world to disappear!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Sad - But the world can't end yet... Not until I save you first!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Sad - Look. I can try harder Minato-kun! I just need to make it to Paradise. That should solve all my problems!
Happy - I'll be taller and more slender. And my body will glow, so I'll be safer at night!
Happy - See? Then I won't be inferior to my brother, and you won't hate being seen with me!

Nozomi Suemitsu
Sad - So, please... don't abandon me.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I feel a strong connection with Suemitsu...

Nozomi Suemitsu
Sad - I have to go, so I don't have time to eat today. I haven't earned forgiveness just yet...
Sad - And I have to find a new member to recruit soon...

Middle-Aged Man's Voice
That was him just now. So can you handle it?

Thug
Sure. All I gotta do is rough him up and I get paid?
You know, I've got this buddy who's kinda strapped for cash, too, if you catch my drift.

Bitter-Looking Man
Fine, you'll both get paid. Just make sure you finish the job.

Bitter-Looking Man
Hm?
Oh, it's you...

Bitter-Looking Man
132,000 yen, right? That's the same trick he used on my son.
If you know what's good for you... stay the hell away from him.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
...I decided to go back to the dorm.

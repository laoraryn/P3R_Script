Elderly Man
Happy - Welcome!
Happy - What would you like to order? Our special today is fresh mackerel!

Elderly Woman
...As you might suspect, we don't serve sushi here.

Elderly Man
Surprised - Oh? You're a student, aren't you? Then you must be from Gekkoukan High, right?
That means... you probably know about the persimmon tree there, don't you?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'm afraid I don't.
Persimmon tree?

Elderly Man
Surprised - You... truly don't know? Not a day goes by that we don't think about that tree!
At Gekkoukan High, there's an open courtyard area. The tree grows beside a walkway there.

Elderly Man
Do you think I'm making this up? I assure you, it's real!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It seems there's a persimmon tree
somewhere at Gekkoukan High.
Does this elderly couple have
some kind of connection to it...?

Elderly Woman
Happy - Please excuse my husband. Just consider it the ramblings of an old man.
Don't you worry your little head, okay?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After saying goodbye to the old couple,
I decided to leave the bookstore.

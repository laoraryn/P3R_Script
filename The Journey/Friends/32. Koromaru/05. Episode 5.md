Looks like Koromaru is out front.
Should I check up on Koromaru?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Check on Koromaru
Not now

DEV: Internal MES - MND_002_0_0
Let's head to where Koromaru is.

-----



Koromaru
......

Koromaru
Arf!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I spend some time
with Koromaru today?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Spend time with Koromaru
Not now

Koromaru
Happy - Arf, arf!

Koromaru
Sad - *whine*

------

Koromaru
Arf.

Girl in a Floral Shirt
Koromaru! I'm back!

Naughty-Looking Boy
Koromaru, you're so warm!

Koromaru
Arr rarrr arrrrrf... *whine*

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The kids are playing pretty
rough with Koromaru...

Girl in a Floral Shirt
Um...
Don't get sick, okay, Koromaru? Lots of people haven't been looking so good lately.

Naughty-Looking Boy
They say if you smile when you gargle, you won't get infected.
And if your feet get too cold, you'll catch depression, so bundle up when you sleep!

Koromaru
Ruff!

Girl in a Floral Shirt
Okay, see you guys later!

Gentle Woman
Hehe, quite exciting over here.

Koromaru
*pant* Ruh?

Gentle Woman
Well, it's been different around town lately, don't you think?
So many people with dead looks in their eyes, not to mention the wild stories going around.
I couldn't help but worry, so I came to check in on you.

Gentle Woman
But it looks like I had nothing to worry about.
So that's enough of that for now. Next time, I'll bring some snacks, all right?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Lots of people are uneasy about the
bizarre events around the world...

Koromaru
*pant* *pant*

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's do our best.
We can't afford to lose.
I'm counting on you.

Koromaru
Arf! Arf!

Old Man's Voice
Oh, there they are!

Old Man
Whew, I'm beat. And it's been getting chillier, too.
Ah, right. Do you know how to play shogi, young man?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, I'm pretty good.
Just a little bit.
No, I've never played.

Old Man
Ah, excellent, excellent.
Then would you humor this old man with a game?

Old Man
Is that so? Then Koromaru can lend you a helping paw.

Old Man
I can teach you. While we're at it, Koromaru can lend you a helping paw.

Koromaru
Happy - Arf!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Koromaru seems like he's up for it.

Old Man
Well, then, shall we begin?
I don't have anyone to play with these days. This is going to be fun.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Koromaru and I played
shogi with the old man...

Koromaru
*pant* Ruff!

Old Man
Heeey, hold it! Koro-chan, it's too early for that hint!

Koromaru
Bark! Bark!

Mitsuru Kirijo
What's going on over here?

Old Man
Oh?
Oh, pardon us. We are right in front of the entrance, aren't we?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Oh, no, don't worry about it.

Old Man
Ah, of course. This is a student dorm, right?
Then does that mean you'll leave this place one day too, young man?

Old Man
I see.
Well, Koromaru. Looks like the next batch of students will look after you, too.
Life may be filled with goodbyes, but they never get any easier.

Koromaru
Sad - *whine*

Minato Arisato - Selection
Check.
It's over.

Old Man
What!?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Hm, that was a good move.

Old Man
Ngh, so what? We're just getting started!

Old Man
Whew, that was a good match. I'll have to stop by again.
Until next time, you two. And to that lovely lady over there... adieu.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Moving out of the dorms... That would be some point after we finish our fight.
It's hard to even imagine right now, but it's something we'll have to face in the future.
After all, we're fighting so we can even have a future.

Koromaru
Sad - *whine*

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Oh, don't you worry, Koromaru. Everyone will love you.

Old Man's Voice
Oh no, my shogi pieces...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Is that the old man from earlier?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Shogi pieces are scattered on the
ground by the old man's feet.
I should probably help him out...

Koromaru
*pant* Ruff!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Koromaru and I helped the old man
and walked him back to his home.

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After the fighting ends...
......
Once the battle is over, Iwatodai Dorm
will have completed serving its purpose.
We'll all eventually go our separate ways.

Koromaru
Arf?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I wonder what Koromaru wants
to do after all the fighting ends...
Maybe I should ask him...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Ask if he wants to join me
Ask what he wants to do

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I asked if he wants to come
with me when this is all over...

Koromaru
Happy - Arf!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I asked him what he wants
to do when this is all over...

Koromaru
Sad - *whine*

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It seems like Koromaru wants to
stick with me after the fighting's over...

Koromaru
Arf!

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's see this through.
Let's deal with Nyx first.
Let's protect the future.

Koromaru
Happy - Arf! Arf, arf!

Koromaru
...Arf.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's an old, ragged collar...
There's an amulet sewn into the back...
Could the priest have made this?

Koromaru
Woof!

Minato Arisato - Selection
Isn't this important to you?
Don't you want to keep this?

Koromaru
...Arf.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
He seems to want me
to keep it for him...
If I brought this along to our next home,
that might make Koromaru happy...

Koromaru
Happy - Arf!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Koromaru seems happy
that I have it...
I should keep this safe for him until
we figure out the post-dorm situation...

Koromaru
......

Minato Arisato - Selection
You can count on me.
I'll take good care of this.

Koromaru
Arf!

Koromaru
Very angry* - Awoooooo!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Koromaru's howl resounds
throughout the quiet shrine...
I can feel a strong sense of
resolve from Koromaru...

Koromaru
Arf!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Koromaru and I slowly made
our way back to the dorm...

You have forged a powerful bond with Koromaru! You can now fuse **Byakko**, the sacred white beast!

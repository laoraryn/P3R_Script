Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Oh, hey, what's up? Is that your dog?   
Happy - Wow, he looks like a smart one... unlike his owner.   
Happy - Ha, I'm just joking.   
Happy - So how's life, man?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - ...And I love how the girl in that show has this mature vibe, y'know what I mean?   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - *pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Whoa! Looks like this guy's had his fair share of fun.   
Guess we should start heading home, then. See ya at school!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru and I returned to the dorm.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Oh, hey. Fancy seeing you here again.   
You're surprisingly diligent, taking care of that little guy.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
I mean, I keep telling them that we're just childhood friends, but they won't stop prying about it.   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - *pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Oh, looks like he's back.   
Guess I'll start heading home, then. See ya later!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru and I returned to the dorm.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Hey! Surprised to see you out here... It's freezing.   
Oh yeah, career consultation's tomorrow, isn't it? You know what you're gonna say?   
At the very least, tell 'em what they wanna hear. Ms. Toriumi's pretty scary when you piss her off...   
Sad - Every time I fall asleep in class, she demands I apologize with a more and more expensive cake...   
Dude, you gotta hear me out...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
So, what do you think? I mean, I'm pretty much set on going to college after graduating...   
I heard some people aren't planning on doing anything at all. No college, no job...   
They just don't wanna put the effort in, I guess...   
I know it's a pain, but I think they've got it all wrong.   
I actually kinda like the way things are, y'know?   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - *pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Oh, you agree with me, boy?   
...Heh, like you actually understand what I'm saying. Anyway, I'm gonna head out.   
I'd better buy a cake just in case...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru and I returned to the dorm.   
   
Bunkichi   
Happy - Well, well, if it isn't Minato-chan. You're quite a rascal, taking to the streets at this hour!   
Surprised - Say, who's the little one? Don't tell me you're a father, Minato-chan!   
...Oh! Looking closely, he's just a dog, isn't he? Heheh, cute little thing!   
   
Bunkichi   
...That's when I decided to make a tray to keep my glasses from being misplaced.   
Sad - But now I have no idea where I put the tray...   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - *pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Bunkichi   
Well, isn't he a ball of energy!   
Happy - I should take a cue from him and sprint my way home. With that, I bid you adieu!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru and I returned to the dorm.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Oh! Hey, Arisato-kun. What's up?   
Happy - Oh my gosh! That is such a cute dog!   
Happy - You are so lucky... I'm not allowed to have pets at my place.   
Oh wait, did you hear? Kaz did it again...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Angry - Seriously, how many times does it have to happen!? This is exactly why his towels stink so bad...   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - *pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, whoops... Sorry, I got in the way of your walk, didn't I?   
I should start heading home anyway. See ya later, doggie!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru and I returned to the dorm.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Hey, Arisato-kun... We meet again!   
Happy - Oh, right. You're walking your dog! Wait, have you been doing this every day?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - So his name's Koromaru-kun? Wait, it's written with the kanji for tiger and wolf!? What a badass!   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - *pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Welcome back, little buddy! You can run around all by yourself, huh? Aren't you a clever boy?   
Aw man, I actually need to get going... I'll see you later, you two!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru and I returned to the dorm.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, Arisato-kun...   
I was actually just thinking about you...   
Kinda caught me off guard.   
Happy - It's almost like you read my mind or something.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Aw, man, this is embarrassing. Did I have a big, stupid grin on my face?   
......   
It just feels kinda... relieving when I'm with you, Arisato-kun.   
So when I'm alone, I think about you and make myself feel a little better.   
Things have been pretty scary lately. Seriously, everyone's been talking like the world is ending!   
But in my mind... I'm okay, 'cause you're right there with me, Arisato-kun.   
Happy - So... thanks.   
Happy - Man, I bet that sounded pretty weird, huh? Haha...   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - *pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, looks like he's back. Well... I'll be off then.   
Happy - ...I'm glad I was able to talk to you about this. I'll see you later.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru and I returned to the dorm.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Oh, Arisato-kun! Out walking with Koro-chan again?   
Happy - Glad I decided to get some fresh air. I've been feeling so stressed out.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
It's been pretty scary lately, don't you think?   
All I hear everywhere I go is people freaking out about the end of the world.   
I know they're just being paranoid, but... I gotta admit, it does kinda get to me...   
You should be careful, okay, Arisato-kun?   
If anything happens, you better let me know. I'll come running in no time!   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - *pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Oh, welcome back!   
Happy - Aww, Koro-chan, you are too cute! Why don't you be my dog instead?   
Happy - Haha, just kidding. I'll see you later, okay?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru and I returned to the dorm.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Oh! Hey, Arisato-kun. Been running into you a lot lately.   
Aren't you freezing in this weather? You guys must be pretty dedicated.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Been seeing a lot of weirdos lately. I get it when people are stressed out in the spring, but why now?   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - *pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Haha, you're as peppy as ever, Koro-chan. Maybe all that warm fur makes a difference.   
Sad - Brrr... It's so freaking cold! We're gonna get sick if we stay out here in this. Let's head back home.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru and I returned to the dorm.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Oh, Arisato-san... Wh-What a coincidence.   
I, uh, ran out of soy sauce, so...   
Oh, um... Is that dog, um...?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - H-He doesn't... bite... does he?   
Sad - I'm actually a little... afraid of dogs. I was attacked by one when I was little...   
Sad - It only knocked me over, but ever since then...   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - *pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Surprised - Eep! O-Oh, I'm sorry...   
Surprised - I... I'm still a little scared, but maybe I'll be okay with this one...   
Um, I'm sorry for taking up so much of your time... I'll see you at school, then!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru and I returned to the dorm.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Oh, Arisato-san! And... Koromaru-kun.   
Um, well... I'm still a little scared, but...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
...I was hoping I could slowly acclimate myself to being around dogs.   
It doesn't look like Koromaru-kun is the type that would bite people...   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - *pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
I'd like to make friends with him. Maybe I'll bring some treats next time...   
Goodness, I'm sorry to interrupt your walk! If you'll excuse me...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru and I returned to the dorm.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Oh, good evening, Arisato-san. It's nice to see you like this again.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Um... Next week is the school trip, isn't it...?   
And first-years don't get to go...   
It's a shame. I like Kyoto, but moreover... well...   
Sad - I would've liked to go with y—   
   
Surprised - I-I mean...! Never mind!   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - *pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
You'll be staying behind as well, won't you, Koromaru-kun?   
Um... If you don't mind, I'd love to hear how the trip was once you return.   
Happy - I'll be looking forward to it.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru and I returned to the dorm.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Oh, good evening, Arisato-san. It's nice to see you like this again.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
That reminds me... Next week is your school trip, isn't it?   
First-years don't get to go... I'm a little envious that you'll get to see Kyoto.   
I'd like to visit that shrine with all the red torii gates.   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - *pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
You'll be staying behind as well, won't you, Koromaru-kun?   
Happy - Hehe... When Arisato-san gets back from Kyoto, let's have him tell us all about it.   
Happy - Please, enjoy your trip to the fullest.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru and I returned to the dorm.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Good evening, Arisato-san.   
Happy - Hehe... It's a little embarrassing running into you at night like this...   
......   
But I think, at the same time, it helps me be a little braver...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Um... I may be a little younger than you, and perhaps not the most reliable...   
But if you ever find yourself in need, I'm here to lend you a helping hand.   
Please don't forget that.   
Sorry if that was sudden. Things have been strange lately, so...   
Hehe... Maybe all those TV programs are starting to influence me.   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - *pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - You're always so full of energy, Koromaru-kun.   
Happy - Well, even if it was just coincidence that we happened to cross paths tonight... I'm glad.   
I would've liked to talk a bit longer, but... it's getting late. We should start heading back.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru and I returned to the dorm.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Oh, good evening, Arisato-san... And you too, Koromaru-kun.   
Do you always take walks around this time?   
I didn't expect Koromaru-kun to be so nocturnal...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Things have been very strange lately...   
......   
How are things for you, Arisato-san? Is everything all right?   
If there's ever anything you need help with... please don't hesitate to tell me.   
I may be a little younger than you, and perhaps not the most reliable...   
But if you ever find yourself in need, I'll be here to lend you a helping hand.   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - *pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Welcome back. You're always so full of energy, Koromaru-kun.   
But I suppose it's getting a little cold. Why don't we start heading back?   
If you'll excuse me... Good night.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru and I returned to the dorm.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Oh, good evening. Hehe, we happen to run into each other a lot, don't we?   
Happy - I stopped by the bookstore and didn't realize it had gotten so late...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
It's a bit scary being out at this hour... There have been more and more strange people around lately.   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - *pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Hehe... I suppose with Koromaru-kun around, we won't have to worry about walking alone at night, will we?   
Oh, look at the time... I think we should start heading back.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru and I returned to the dorm.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - Oh, Arisato-kun. What a coincidence.   
Hey, I didn't know you had a dog. Is that a Shiba?   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
That white fur is really nice. Almost makes him look mystical or something, don't you think?   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - *pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - Oh man, he just looks so cool! I wonder how soft he is...   
Sad - Well, I don't want to make him uncomfortable or anything.   
Hey, do you think I could try petting him next time? I'll study up the proper way to do it.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru and I returned to the dorm.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Oh, Arisato-kun. It's pretty cold today too, huh?   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
By the way, is it all right for you to be out at this hour?   
I guess I'm one to talk, but...   
A lot of people have been acting strange these days. I wonder if it's... some kind of new disease.   
Nobody knows the cause or how to prevent it... I really hope it calms down soon.   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - *pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Oh, sorry... I didn't mean to keep you so long.   
Well, I'm going to head home. You guys be careful on your way back, okay?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru and I returned to the dorm.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Oh, hey Arisato. What are you doing out this late?   
Ah, walking the dog, huh? I didn't know you had one.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
We used to have a dog, too. Man, that brings back memories...   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - *pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Haha, he's a lively one, isn't he? I bet running alongside this little guy would be great practice.   
For now, I'll run along home. I'll see you later, Arisato!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru and I returned to the dorm.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Oh, hey Arisato. That's right, you walk your dog around this time...   
I'm just out for a light run. Felt like I needed a little more after club practice.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
...It's kinda chilly just standing around. Wanna do some stair laps over there?   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - *pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Oh, welcome back. You've got some pretty good form, there.   
I should get back to my run. I'll see you later!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru and I returned to the dorm.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Whoa! Hey, Arisato! What's up?   
...Wait, I didn't know you had a dog.   
Hmm, looking at you two... I can kinda see the resemblance.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Remember Hayase? Apparently, the guy moved.   
Wasn't expecting that... But I guess we'll see him around as long as we keep doing track.   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - *pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Whoa, this guy's a fast runner! Did he learn that from you?   
...Oh, crap! I was supposed to be doing errands! Uh, gotta go!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru and I returned to the dorm.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Oh, guess we meet again!   
Do you always walk this route? I would have thought you'd change it up now and then.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
...I heard there's a guy who runs insanely fast around here.   
I've been roaming around hoping to see what's up, but I haven't found a trace of him.   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - *pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Oh, this guy's back. Man, he's a fast one, too...   
Well, I'd better get going. I'll see you later, Arisato.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru and I returned to the dorm.

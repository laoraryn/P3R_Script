Looks like Koromaru is out front.
Should I check up on Koromaru?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Check on Koromaru
Not now

DEV: Internal MES - MND_002_0_0
Let's head to where Koromaru is.

-----

Yukari Takeba
Huh? Hey, have you seen Koro-chan?

Minato Arisato - Selection
He went outside.
He ran away...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Aww, and just when I was about to brush him...

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Wait, is that bad!?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Again?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - What? No way!
Surprised - That's bad, right!? We have to go after him!

Mitsuru Kirijo
It's fine, no need for that.

Mitsuru Kirijo
He likes to step out front every so often to get some sunlight.

Yukari Takeba
Whew, thank goodness.
Well, I guess it's not a big deal if he's just basking in the sun.
Koro-chan would never bite or bark at people anyway.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I agree with you there. However...
We still have the responsibility of being his owners.
I don't want to restrict his freedom too much, but we still have to be mindful.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I've been getting him to come back in whenever I notice he's gone out.
Try to do the same if you ever happen to see him outside.

Mitsuru Kirijo (SE)
Come on, Koromaru. It's time to come in.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Responsibility, huh. Yeah, I guess that's true.
Sad - He may be a Persona-user, but he is still a dog.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
If I see Koromaru outside,
I should call out to him.

===============================================================================================


Koromaru
Arf?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Isn't it hot out here?
Let's go inside.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Aren't you cold out here?
Let's go inside.

Koromaru
......

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Koromaru won't budge.
I wonder if there's a reason
he wants to stay out here.
Maybe I can find out why if I spend
some time with Koromaru...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I spend some time
with Koromaru today?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Spend time with Koromaru
Not now

Koromaru
Happy - Arf!

------

Koromaru
Woof...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Koromaru is eagerly watching
all the people pass by.

Old Man
Oooh! Is that you there, Koromaru?

Old Man
Do you remember me? I used to play shogi with the priest.

Koromaru
Happy - Arf! Arf Arf!

Old Man
Hoho, I see, I see.

Old Man
Oh, dear...

Old Man
Whew, I'm sorry, but do you mind if I rest here for a bit?

Minato Arisato - Selection
By all means.
Want to rest inside?

Old Man
Much obliged. Sorry to bother you.

Old Man
Down we go...

Old Man
Oh, no, no. Here's fine.

Old Man
Down we go...

Old Man
Whew... The years are catching up to me.

Koromaru
Sad - *whine* Arf arf, arf!

Old Man
Do you live here?

Old Man
In that case, I have to give you my thanks.
So thank you. For taking Koromaru in as your family.

Old Man
A lot's been going on ever since the priest's accident.
To tell you the truth, someone else was willing to take Koromaru in.

Minato Arisato - Selection
What was this person like?
But he was always at the shrine.

Old Man
A sweet and pleasant young lady. Koromaru took quite a shine to her.
Only... Well, he'd keep coming back to the shrine gate.

Old Man
That's right.
We eventually realized that Koromaru kept going back to the shrine.

Koromaru
......

Old Man
I'm not sure what it was, but it seemed like he had some unfinished business.
And after that, no one else was able to take him in.

Old Man
However...
If he's here now, I take it he achieved his goal, then?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Koromaru saw it through.
He protected the shrine.

Koromaru
Happy - Arf!

Old Man
I see, I see!
I can't say I really understand.
But if you do, then Koromaru must be happy.

Koromaru
Happy - Arf!

Old Man
I see. You did well, didn't you, boy?
To be honest, I don't really understand any of this.
But if you do, then Koromaru must be happy.

Old Man
I believe that Koromaru's bright enough to choose where he wants to be.
And that means it must be his choice to be here with you.
Be good to each other, will you?

Minato Arisato - Selection
We will!
We'll see...

Koromaru
Woof.

Old Man
All right, I've rested plenty. I'll get out of your hair before it gets too late.

Old Man
Upsy-daisy.

Old Man
Ow ow ow...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Poor old man... He's hurting his
back from carrying too much.

Koromaru
Sad - *whine*

Minato Arisato - Selection
Can I help you out?
Let me carry your bags.

Old Man
I'm sorry to be such a bother. Yes, would you mind taking half of what I'm carrying?

Koromaru
Happy - Ruff!

Old Man
Oh, that's very sweet of you. I'd like that very much.

Koromaru
Happy - Ruff!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Koromaru and I walked with
the old man back to his place.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, Arisato-kun.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Hehe, you're in a good mood, Koro-chan. Did you go for a walk?

Koromaru
Happy - Arf Arf!

Aigis
...You helped? Ah, I see.
I believe Koromaru-san wants to thank you, Minato-san.
He says, "Let's do it again."

Koromaru
Happy - *pant* *pant* Arf!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I think Koromaru appreciates me!
I feel like my  has increased
after helping people with Koromaru.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Should we head in? It's almost Koro-chan's dinner time.

Aigis
I'll be preparing your dinner today, Koromaru-san. I hope you look forward to it.

Koromaru
Sad - *whimper*

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We headed in the dorm after
Koromaru calmed down a bit.

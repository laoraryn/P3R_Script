Looks like Koromaru is out front.
Should I check up on Koromaru?

Not now

Let's head to where Koromaru is.

Koromaru
......

Koromaru
Arf!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I spend some time
with Koromaru today?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Spend time with Koromaru
Not now

Koromaru
Happy - Arf, arf!

Koromaru
Sad - *whine*

-----

Gentle Woman
Well, hello there. It's the inseparable duo.

Gentle Woman
Hehe! Yes, you're still a good boy today, too.

Koromaru
Happy - Owaaooo! Owoooo!

Gentle Woman
Oh! My gift is going to get cold.
Look, I brought you some takoyaki today.

Koromaru
*pant* *pant*

Gentle Woman
It's Octopia's specialty—tako-free takoyaki for dogs.
There's one for people too, so enjoy them together, okay?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The woman left the
takoyaki and walked off...

Koromaru
*munch* *munch*

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's the stray dog that chased that
boy around a little while ago...
He looks like he's in bad shape...

Sad Dog
*whimper*

Koromaru
Woof!

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's share some.
Should we chase him away?
He looks pretty hungry...

Koromaru
Happy - Arf! Arf!

Koromaru
Sad - *pant* *pant*

Koromaru
Ruff! Ruff!

Sad Dog
*munch* *munch*

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Huh?
Now that I look closer,
I see he has a collar...

Koromaru
*pant* Arf?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's find his owner.
Let's talk to Officer Kurosawa.

Koromaru
*pant* Arf!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I decided to take the stray
dog to the police station.

===============================================================================================

Officer Kurosawa
It doesn't look like anyone's reported him missing yet.

Officer Kurosawa
So, you guys are helping stray dogs now, too?
Aren't you spreading yourselves a bit too thin?

Koromaru
Ruff, ruff ruff! Ruff!

Officer Kurosawa
Settle down now, Koromaru. You haven't changed at all, have you, boy?
He's always felt the need to be this town's watchdog. Maybe he got it from the priest.
And now that he's with you, he's more righteous than ever, isn't he?

Officer Kurosawa
Anyway, hang on a minute.

Officer Kurosawa
No answer.

Officer Kurosawa
......
Hello, this is Officer Kurosawa from the Tatsumi East Police Station.
Well, it was written on the collar... Yes, no one answered, so I called you instead.
Yes, that's right. A brown, medium-sized dog.

Officer Kurosawa
I see. All right, I'll see you then.

Koromaru
Woooo?

Officer Kurosawa
We've managed to identify the owner.
However, they're in the hospital after falling to Apathy Syndrome.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Are they okay?
What will happen to the dog?
......

Officer Kurosawa
Yeah. The owner's family will take the dog in.

Officer Kurosawa
Don't worry. The owner's family will take the dog in.

Officer Kurosawa
Don't look so glum. The owner's family will take the dog in.

Officer Kurosawa
Cases like this one have been on the rise.
Pets are being abandoned because their owners are falling prey to Apathy Syndrome.
And to survive, the pets have no choice but to take to the streets.

Koromaru
Sad - *whine*

Officer Kurosawa
Maybe you need to hear this, so just know that you guys are doing fine.
I don't know the whole picture, but that much I'm certain about.

Koromaru
Sad - *whine*

Officer Kurosawa
I'm going to get back to work now. Watch yourselves on your way home, all right?

===============================================================================================

Koromaru
Sad - *whine*

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Koromaru seems sad...
Is he thinking about that dog,
or the people who were harmed?
We're the only ones who
can change this situation...

Koromaru
Sad - ......

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's defeat the Shadows.
Let's do everything we can.

Koromaru
...Woof.

Koromaru
Arf arf!

Koromaru
Awooooo!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can feel a strong sense of
determination from Koromaru...
Dedicating myself to the cause along with
Koromaru gave me more ...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Koromaru and I went back
to the dorm together...

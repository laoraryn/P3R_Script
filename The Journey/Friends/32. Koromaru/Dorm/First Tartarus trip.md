Koromaru   
Ruff!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oho, someone's all revved to go.   
   
Junpei Iori   
But hey, do you think Koromaru actually understands what we're doin'?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'm sure he does.   
Probably not.   
I wonder...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Think so? Even if he can use a Persona, he's still a dog, y'know?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Whoa... Harsh words, boss.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeah, who knows?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Heyyy, Koromaru! So which is it?   
   
Koromaru   
*pant*   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Huh? Nothin'?   
   
Aigis   
He said, "Resolve is shown through actions."   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - B-But... he's just a dog.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - What a freakin' badass! You are THE coolest dog!

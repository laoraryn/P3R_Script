Fuuka Yamagishi
I always wondered what they meant by "hard" science fiction.
So the last time I passed by this theater, I asked the ticket clerk.

Fuuka Yamagishi
He said, "It's a science fiction story that could actually happen."
I actually don't find movies about far away galaxies or magic and spellcasting that interesting...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I like movies that make you think, "Ten years down the road, maybe this could happen."
Happy - You get to see a familiar world, but just slightly more advanced.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I think it's fun to imagine our world slowly changing like that...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Oh, sorry! I got a little carried away. We still haven't even seen the movie yet.
Happy - I hope we can get good seats.

Futuristic High School Girl
...Morning, Roboco.

Helper Robot
GOOD MORNING, MASTER. THERE ARE NO CHANGES TO YOUR REGULAR SCHEDULE TODAY.

Futuristic High School Girl
I'm so bored. When will I meet my shining android prince atop a gallant white steed...?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I got a look at what life could
be like in the near future.
And learned about cutting-edge
scientific theories...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Wow, that was amazing. I wonder if our civilization will ever advance that far...
Happy - Like, did you see that iron!? It got rid of the wrinkles on their clothes in half a second.

Fuuka Yamagishi
To get that much heat out of an iron so quickly, you'd probably have to keep it charged.
Though it wouldn't have to be with electricity. It could be gas-powered, or even a hybrid...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Or maybe they have a totally new energy source! But they'd still need some sort of system to send energy into the iron...
......

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Oh! I-I'm sorry!
The movie got me all excited, so I got a bit carried away.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Anyway, I hope we can come again sometime.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I decided to go back to
the dorm with Fuuka.

Happy - Oh, there's the soundtrack I've been looking for... Wow, I didn't expect to find it so easily.
I couldn't find it anywhere online.
This store isn't very big, but they seem to carry a lot of CDs that are normally hard to find...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, um, there's something I've been wanting to ask you...

Fuuka Yamagishi
You know how there's a connection between sight and taste? I think there's a connection between sound and taste, too.
Like, when you hear steak sizzling on a frying pan, or hot soup bubbling in a pot.
Doesn't it make you really hungry all of a sudden when you hear these sounds?
Do you think it's possible to connect music to cooking in that same vein?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, I think so.
I can't imagine so.
Not interested.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - You do!? Really!?
Happy - Oh, I'm so excited now. Maybe I should do some research on it...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Fuuka seems happy.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Exasperated* - Hmmm...
Exasperated* - Well, I heard that wine connoisseurs play classical music when they drink wine, but...
Exasperated* - Maybe it's just not possible with cooking.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Fuuka seems to be having
fun playing with the idea...
I learned a little more about her today.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Oh... Do you think that's dumb?
Sad - I was being serious though...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Fuuka seems sad...
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Just like how the quality of ingredients is important in cooking, I think it's the same with music, too.
Using higher quality equipment can help enhance and produce better sounds.
Happy - I might go check out the home appliance store and see what they have in stock.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We went looking for appliances together
before heading back to the dorm.

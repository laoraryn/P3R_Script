Fuuka Yamagishi
Have you ever read the manga Titanium Chef?
I was curious about how the series would end since it suddenly switched publishers.
Happy - I'm just glad I finally got to finish it. Thanks for coming, Arisato-kun.
The art in this manga is incredible... All the food looks so delicious!

Fuuka Yamagishi
By the way, Arisato-kun...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Have you ever filleted a fish before?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, I'm not too bad.
I've never tried before.
Not interested.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Wow, really?
To be honest, I can't stand touching raw fish. They're kinda slimy, and stinky too...
Plus, I'm clumsy with a knife...
Happy - But maybe I could learn by example. Would you show me how to do it next time?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Fuuka seems impressed.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - ...Not even once?
Surprised - But I thought you had home economics?
Sad - I'm actually pretty clumsy with a knife, so I can't even fillet a fish myself.
Sad - How am I going to get better at cooking if I can't learn basic knife skills...?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Fuuka seems down...
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - ...Oh, really?
Well, I guess there are plenty of other cheap and tasty dishes to choose from these days.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Fuuka is smiling.
I learned a little more about her today.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I'm in the mood to cook now after reading Titanium Chef.
Happy - I think I'll buy some ingredients before heading home. Maybe I could get some vegetables that are in season.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After shopping with Fuuka,
I decided to return to the dorm.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - What a beautiful day!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I'm surprised there are so many people here today...
I thought only Port Island got this crowded.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I didn't visit the strip mall very often until I moved into the dorms, but I really like it here.
Sometimes you never really notice how close by these places are, huh?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Um, Arisato-kun.

Fuuka Yamagishi
What do you usually do on your days off?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Stay in my room.
Spend time with friends.
I don't remember.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, so you like staying inside, huh?
Happy - Oh, really? That's kind of unexpected. I didn't take you for the indoorsy type.

Fuuka Yamagishi
So am I, but... I guess you could probably tell by just looking at me.
Happy - But I'm happy we have that in common...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Fuuka has a smile on her face.
I learned a little more about her today.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, right. You seem to have a lot of friends.
Sad - I don't really have very many...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - It'd be nice if we could go out and do something like this again sometime...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Fuuka looks a little embarrassed.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Fuuka Yamagishi
...Oh.
......
Sad - Um, er...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Did I bring up something I shouldn't have...?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Fuuka looks worried.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, sorry for spacing out.
Since we're having such pleasant weather today, why don't we buy something and sit on a bench to eat?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We walked around the strip mall for a little
while before heading back to the dorm.

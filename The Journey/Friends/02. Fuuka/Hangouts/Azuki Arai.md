Happy - The anmitsu was absolutely delightful.
Happy - Mmm... Their azuki bean paste was just the right amount of sweetness. I think I'm hooked!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Um, Arisato-kun. Do you like sweets?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I do.
Not really.
Never thought about it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Really? I have a sweet tooth, too.
Happy - That makes me happy.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I know people say sugar is bad for you, but there are some health benefits.
In fact, glucose is an essential source of fuel for your brain.

Fuuka Yamagishi
You know how you sometimes get hungry after using your brain all day?
It's caused by low levels of glucose, which makes your blood sugar drop.
Happy - And, did you know...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Fuuka seems really happy.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Oh...

Fuuka Yamagishi
That's too bad... I love sweets, actually.
Sad - I thought that, if we had similar tastes in food, I could make you lunch sometime, but...

Fuuka Yamagishi
To each their own, I guess.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Fuuka seems a little disappointed.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Fuuka Yamagishi
I see... Are you the type of person who doesn't have a favorite food?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - To be honest, I'm a bit like that, too. I'm only interested in cooking food.
You know how some people would stand in line for hours just to buy some popular desserts?
I could never understand why anyone would do that...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Haha, guess we're kind of alike—just in a weird way?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Fuuka is laughing.
I learned a little more about her today.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I think it's important to try all kinds of food though. That way, I can improve my cooking.
Happy - If I come up with a new recipe, would you like to try it? Maybe I could make something with black sugar...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We continued to chat while
heading back to the dorm.

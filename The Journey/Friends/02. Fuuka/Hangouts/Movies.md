Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - That was a great movie.
I'm surprised at how advanced CG has gotten. They can do almost anything with it nowadays.
Sometimes, I wonder...
Is it possible that our technology has already surpassed human imagination?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, that reminds me, since we're talking about movies...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Do you prefer watching movies at the theater or at home on DVD?

Minato Arisato - Selection
At the theater.
At home on DVD.
I don't watch movies.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I see. So you like the atmosphere at a movie theater, huh?
Happy - Well, I guess the speakers in a theater are much better than those on a TV.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Fuuka seems to be enjoying herself.
I learned a little more about her today.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, you like to relax at home when watching movies? Me too!
I like watching the bonus scenes on the DVD version...
You can't see those in the theater.
Happy - Anyway, I'm kind of happy we have something in common.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Fuuka seems really happy.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, I see...
Sad - Um...
Sad - So the only reason you came was because I wanted you to?
Sad - If that's the case, I'm sorry...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Fuuka seems apologetic.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Thanks for coming today. Shall we head back now?
Oh, actually, I wanted to buy some new spices and seasoning.
I'm going to stop by the strip mall first, so I'll see you later.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After waving goodbye to Fuuka
as she headed to the strip mall,
I returned to the dorm.

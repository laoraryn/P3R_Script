It's so hard to decide what to get when there's so many cakes to choose from.
I'm going to try the cheese tart. Oh, um... Did that "Amant" cake catch your interest, Arisato-kun?
Actually...

Fuuka Yamagishi
You've been awfully friendly with different girls lately, haven't you?

What're you talking about?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Hehe, sorry.
Happy - I was just teasing you about your taste in cakes.
This cake is called "Amant," which means "paramour" in French.
They say it's so sweet it makes you forget all about your real lover.
Happy - It's a pretty clever name, isn't it?
Happy - I'm not great at small talk, but this cake makes a nice conversation starter.

I learned a little more about her today.

Happy - Eating something sweet can help alleviate exhaustion. Maybe I'll buy some desserts for everyone at the dorm.
Happy - Will you help me choose some on our way out?

Happy - This place sure is convenient.
Happy - Not only is it relatively cheap, but the balance of the ingredients is well thought out, too.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - The ambiance here is really inviting, too, so it's easy for us girls to come eat here on our own.
Happy - I like to come here every now and then. It's nice to have a place like this nearby.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, that's right. Arisato-kun, there's something I've been meaning to ask you...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Which do you like more? Japanese food or Western food?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Japanese food.
Western food.
Food is food.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, really?
Happy - I'm glad to hear that. I prefer Japanese food, too.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Hmmm... I think I'll start with white rice and miso soup.
I'm going to try to re-create the food they make here.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I can't wait to start!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Fuuka seems excited.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, I see.
Hmmm... There are so many different kinds of Western food.
I'll have to get used to cooking with vegetable oil, too.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - But I can't wait to give it a try!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Fuuka seems determined.
I learned a little more about her today.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, really?
So, you don't have a favorite type of food?
Sad - Hmmm... That's going to make things difficult.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Fuuka seems a little disappointed.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, I better jot down any ideas that come to mind before I forget.
Happy - Don't mind me, Arisato-kun. You can keep eating. Hm, let's see...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I waited for Fuuka to finish writing her
notes before heading back to the dorm.

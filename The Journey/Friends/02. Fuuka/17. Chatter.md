I'm going with Yukari-chan to look for a swimsuit to wear in Yakushima.
I've never bought a swimsuit for fun before...
Sad - Yukari-chan didn't really seem into it though... Do you think she's nervous about the trip...?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - It's nice to have a shopping mall so close to the dorm, isn't it?
Happy - On hot days, you don't have to spend as much time walking out in the sun.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Wearing something like this on New Year's really makes me feel more put together.
Happy - Although the sash makes it... a little hard to breathe...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, Arisato-kun. Are you on your way home?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's walk home together.
Yep. See you.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Oh, I'm sorry... I was about to do some research.
I'm actually learning how to cook, but I'm still just experimenting...
I don't think I can make anything edible at this point, and I don't want to waste your time...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
If I volunteer to help her, I might regret it...
I don't have the  to risk it...
My  would
need to be  first.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Okay. Be careful on your way home.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, Arisato-kun... Are you busy?
Also, if you happen to be a little hungry...

Minato Arisato - Selection
I have time.
Sorry, I'm busy.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, good! In that case, would you do me a favor?
Happy - I was hoping you could taste the lunch I made.
Sad - To be honest, I don't have very much confidence in my cooking...
Happy - But today, I think it turned out okay!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - O-Oh, um...
...N-Never mind. Sorry. Be careful on your way home.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I've got a bad feeling about this...
But I have enough  to try it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - So... will you taste it?

Minato Arisato - Selection
All right.
I'll pass.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, thank you! Okay, please come with me.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Oh, I see...
Sad - I guess no one would want to eat something that doesn't taste very good...
It's okay, don't worry about it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, Arisato-kun. Are you heading home?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It seems like Fuuka wants
to walk home with me.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I spend some time
after school with Fuuka?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Spend time with her
Check Social Link status
Not now

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Okay.
Where should we go?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, um...
Th-Then...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - W-W-Would you...
Angry - Would you like to come to my room!?
......
Happy - ...I-I mean, if you want to. Is that okay?

Fuuka Yamagishi
U-Um...
Angry - Okay... Sure.
Happy - W-Would you... like to come to my room?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Oh, I see...
Okay, maybe some other time then.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, Arisato-kun.
Happy - I was just thinking... I hope we can be in the same class next year.
Very happy* - I know it sounds silly, but I'd really like to see you every day.
Happy - And I don't think my feelings will ever change...
......
Happy - ...Arisato-kun.
Happy - I will always be by your side.
......

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I feel an unbreakable bond
with Fuuka...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, Arisato-kun.
I was just thinking, I really hope we can be in the same class next year.
We're going to be third-years, so we'll probably be busy studying for college entrance exams and whatnot.
But I think even that would be fun with all my friends.
Plus, I might be able to help everyone else with their studies, too.
So if you ever need help with anything, Arisato-kun, you can always count on me.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I feel an unbreakable bond
with Fuuka...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - By the way, are you on your way home now? Did you have any plans?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Say, are you busy right now?
By the way, if you happen to be a little hungry...

Fuuka Yamagishi

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, Arisato-kun. Looks like we're finally done with exams.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - We made it to the end. Now we can get back to our club activities.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - We made it to the end. Hopefully that relieves some stress at school for a while.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - We made it to the end. I hope we both did well.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Ah, Arisato-kun. Are you about to head home?
Sad - Um... I could use your help again, if you have the time...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, right! Are you about to head home?
Sad - Um... I could use your help again, if you have the time...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Really? Then, let's head to the courtyard again.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, Arisato-kun.
Happy - I'm just about to head home. How about you?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, that's right.
Happy - I'm just about to head home. How about you?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Okay, then let's go.
Now that I think about it... even though we live in the same dorm, we've never gone back together before.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Hello, Arisato-kun.
If you're leaving now, would you like to go shopping with me?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, by the way...
If you're leaving now, would you like to go shopping with me?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Thank you! Let's head to Paulownia Mall.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, Arisato-kun. Do you have any plans today?
Sad - I have a favor to ask, if you have the time...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, did you have any plans today?
Sad - I have a favor to ask, if you have the time...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Thank you. Let's see then...
Happy - How about we go to the roof? The view up there is so nice...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Arisato-kun...
Sad - Are you free right now? There's something I want to talk to you about...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Um... Are you free right now? There's something I want to talk to you about...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - ...Thank you.
Let's go back up to the roof. I'm sorry, this won't take long.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, Arisato-kun. Are you busy today?
Happy - I'm heading to the used bookstore right now. Do you want to join me?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Say, are you busy today?
Happy - I'm heading to the used bookstore right now. Do you want to join me?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, great! Thank you.
I've been looking for a good cookbook for a while now. Do you think they'll have any?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Hello, Arisato-kun. Are you heading home?
Happy - ...If you aren't too busy, do you think we could talk on the roof?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, are you heading home?
Happy - ...If you aren't too busy, do you think we could talk on the roof?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Thank you! I hope no one's sitting at our usual spot...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, Arisato-kun...
......
Sad - Um... I was hoping we could talk.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Also...
......
Sad - Um... I was hoping we could talk.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Thank you...
Happy - I'd like to go to the roof, then. Shall we?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Oh, Arisato-kun...
Sad - U-Um, are you heading home for the day? Did you have any plans?
Sad - If not, maybe we could go together...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - U-Um, are you heading home for the day? Did you have plans?
Sad - If not, maybe we could go together...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, are you heading home?
Would you happen to be free today? I was hoping you could join me for something.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, are you heading home?
Would you happen to be free today? I was hoping you could join me for something.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Thanks. I would've had a hard time going by myself...
Happy - It's the ramen shop at the strip mall. Do you eat there a lot?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Arisato-kun, are you busy today?
If not... do you think we could chat on the roof for a bit?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Arisato-kun, are you busy today?
If not... do you think we could chat on the roof for a bit?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Thanks. I actually really enjoy when we get to talk up there.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, Arisato-kun!
I was thinking of returning to the dorm to cook...
Happy - Would you like to join me? I'll be starting from scratch today.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, that's right.
I was thinking of going back to the dorm right now to cook...
Happy - Would you like to join me? I'll be starting from scratch today.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Great! Hehe, this is going to be so much fun.
Happy - I've already bought everything we need, so why don't we head back and get started?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Oh, I see...
Happy - Okay, maybe next time then.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Oh...
All right, I'll see you later then.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Oh, I'm sorry. Did you have plans?
I guess it'll have to wait until next time.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Oh, I see...
Okay, maybe some other time then.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, sorry. Are you busy?
Okay, maybe next time then. I'll see you back at the dorm.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Oh, I see...
Okay, maybe next time, if you're free.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, okay. Sorry about that.
Happy - Maybe some other time then, when you're available.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, that's too bad.
Happy - Maybe some other day.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Oh, I see...
Okay, some other time then, when you're free.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, did you already have plans?
Maybe next time then. I think I might head home now.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - O-Oh... I should've guessed...
Surprised - Um... It's nothing! I'll see you later!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, sorry, I shouldn't have imposed. It's okay if you're busy.
Happy - Maybe some other time then. I'll see you later.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Okay, I'll see you back at the dorm. I'll be back before it gets too late.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Arisato-kun! Help us, please!
Surprised - Junpei-kun won't stop— Ah! Ahhh!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Heheh, alley-oop! Take this! And this!
Happy - C'mon, water fights are pretty much a given at the beach! Nice and cool, ain't it?

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Hey, knock it off! You're taking this too far! Okay, fine! You asked for it!

Fuuka Yamagishi
I saw Yukari-chan and Kirijo-senpai together earlier.
They looked like they were having fun chatting with each other. You don't see that very often.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I'm glad that Kirijo-senpai seems to be feeling better.

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Okay, I think that does it for the gyoza filling.   
Happy - I thought it might be nice to add some texture, so I made sure there's plenty of vegetables mixed in.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
How bold.   
Is that safe?   
But I like meat...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I'm a little worried, but I wanted to give it a try.   
Happy - We went by the book for the seasoning, so it shouldn't turn out too different.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Yes, it'll be fine. We went by the book for the seasoning. And besides...   
Happy - I think it's more fun if we have something new to try, regardless of whether it works or not.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh, um... There's plenty of meat too!   
But there wasn't quite enough, so just try and pretend the vegetables are meat too...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Next we have to put the filling in the wrappers, but...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Where is she...?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Sorry I'm late! It was a long day of practice.   
Happy - Oh, have you gotten pretty far already?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Welcome back! We were just starting on the wrappers.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I invited Yukari-chan to join us.   
Happy - We were talking about cooking the other day, and she seemed really interested.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I mean, you almost never invite me to something like this, Fuuka.   
Happy - So I was happy when you did.   
Happy - Have you changed recently, or is it just me?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
...Have I? In what way?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - You just seem more at ease now. Or maybe it's more confidence? Don't you think so, Arisato-kun?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I agree.   
You haven't seen anything yet.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Yeah, see? That's what I thought.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Really? Well, I'm glad if that's the case.   
Arisato-kun's been helping me a lot recently.   
Happy - And been really supportive of me. So I think maybe that's why.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
What's that supposed to mean? Sounds like you know something I don't.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um, Arisato-kun's just been there for me a lot recently.   
Happy - He helped me see I had a real opportunity to change.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...I see.   
Angry - Arisato-kun... You haven't been... making moves on Fuuka, have you?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - N-No! It's not like that!   
Surprised - He was just helping me as a friend! That's all, really!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Well, I trust Fuuka, so I guess you're in the clear.   
Happy - But if you weren't, you'd be eating my fist, Arisato-kun.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Wow, I guess that's our leader for you.   
Junpei oughta take some notes.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
W-Well, everyone has their own strengths.   
Happy - And I'm sure Junpei-kun has plenty of things he's good at too.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Yeah, I know.   
Not that I'd ever say that to his face though. It'd go straight to his head.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - ...Hehe.   
Oh, the gyoza wrappers are going to dry out. Let's start wrapping, shall we?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Everyone finished wrapping the   
gyoza, and then we started cooking.   
I can hear them crackling pleasantly.   
......   
The gyoza are finished! They look delicious.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Wow, it's so good!   
Happy - How are yours, Yukari-chan?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - The flavor and texture are perfect! I think this is the best gyoza I've ever had.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - There's plenty more white rice if you want too.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - Ooh, I would, but...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Sorry! I actually gotta get going.   
Exasperated* - I've gotta clean my archery uniform before tomorrow.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, you can leave my dishes! I'll clean them when I get back.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - You don't have to worry about that. Besides, we'll save on water if we do them all at once.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - Ugh, sorry about this...   
I'll make sure I can stick around till the end next time! But thanks for having me!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Did you notice she said, "next time"?   
Happy - I was a little nervous at first, but I'm glad I challenged myself.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh! That reminds me.   
I have something I wanted to give you, Arisato-kun.   
You're always listening to music, so I thought you might like these.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
And I think you were a fan of this design, so I tried to match it...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I replaced my old headphones   
with the ones Fuuka gave me.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
!!   
The sound quality is unbelievably clear!   
Her technical skills must be next-level.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Remember how I told you I was pretty good with machines? Well, how are they?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I love them!   
My mind is blown.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Hehe, pretty cool, right?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Hehe, pretty cool, right?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
...Just kidding.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Actually, I've decided I want to become more accepting of myself. I want to be able to say I'm proud of who I am.   
And I think this is the first step to reaching that goal.   
I'm going to be more confident in the things I'm good at.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I hope you're happy with them.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I can sense Fuuka cares about me.   
I feel like we've forged a powerful bond...   
   
SYS_046_0_0   
The High Priestess Social Link reached its maximum level! You can now fuse **Scathach**, the instructor!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
But I'm not going to give up on cooking either.   
I'll embrace the things I'm good at, but also find more things I can do.   
I'm going to change, one step at a time.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh, if there's anything you decide you want to try doing, Arisato-kun, just let me know.   
Happy - I'll always be here to help.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I had a good time eating   
gyoza and talking with Fuuka.

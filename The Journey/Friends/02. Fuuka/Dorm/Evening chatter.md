Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Living in a dorm is kinda exciting, isn't it?   
Settling into a new room with all my old stuff is a nice change of pace. I'm struggling a bit trying to rearrange things though...   
But honestly, I'm just glad I get to live here with all of you.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I thought that we were supposed to stay in the dorm on our days off...   
Happy - Or, rather, I used to think so.   
Happy - Yukari-chan mentioned earlier that she was going to visit the shrine.   
Happy - So we have more freedom here than I expected... It's a new experience for me.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um... As you may know, my Persona is called Lucia.   
Since I specialize in detecting enemies and processing information, my job is to provide everyone support.   
So, while I can't confront enemies directly like you do...   
I'll still do whatever I can to help out the team.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Junpei-kun said you're playing an online game. Is that true, Arisato-kun?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yes, it is.   
No.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, so you can play with people from all over the world, right?   
Happy - It's great that the Internet is able to connect all kinds of people. Maybe I should give it a try...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, I see... But, Junpei-kun gave you one, right?   
Maybe you should give it a try. Who knows? You might meet someone new through the game.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I ran an estimate on the strength of the remaining large Shadows that appear during full moons...   
And, as you can probably guess, we're going to be in for a long, hard fight, but... I think we can handle it.   
I'm sure we'll be fine as long as you keep training and growing stronger in Tartarus...   
Happy - So let's both do our best.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Wow, there's no one here... Everyone must have gone out.   
I think Yukari-chan went to the shrine again.   
I don't have any plans for today, so I think I'll just stay here...   
If you want to head out, then you should, Arisato-kun. Don't worry about me, I'm fine.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Looks like Kirijo-senpai and Sanada-senpai aren't around, so let's go to Tartarus some other time.   
I think I'll take it easy tonight, too.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The other day, I stumbled upon something online while doing some research...   
Sad - Apparently, there was an unexplained explosion near our school ten years ago.   
Sad - At the same time, a large number of students refused to attend school...   
Sad - The news reports stated that the incidents were somehow related.   
That's all there is to the story. Now it's all in the past, but doesn't it make you curious?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I know the chairman means well, but sometimes I just don't know how to react to his jokes.   
Sad - But I also feel bad pretending I didn't hear him... What should I do...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Just fake a laugh.   
Be true to your heart.   
Just act normal.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You're right...   
Sad - Like this? "Oh, Mr. Chairman, that's sooo funny! Ahahaha..."   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I do think it's important to listen to your heart, but... this is a special exception.   
Sad - If I tell him his jokes aren't funny, it'll hurt his feelings...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
O-Okay... Be normal... Normal...   
Sad - I don't know how long I could keep that up, though... I really wish he'd talk about something else instead.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - You know those couples who came down with Apathy Syndrome? It's a hot topic in my class...   
Sad - But I can't figure out why they've been attacking groups of two specifically...   
I just don't see the point... Is this all part of the Shadow's plan?   
I hope we can figure something out with our investigation... Anyway, let's keep our chins up.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There's nobody around today either. I wonder if they're all the outdoorsy type.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Looks like Kirijo-senpai and Sanada-senpai aren't around, so let's go to Tartarus some other time.   
I think I'll go to bed early tonight since I usually stay up way too late.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, um... Uh, w-we were just talking about girl stuff, that's all.   
It's not like I was asked to look into something or anything. It's really nothing. Nothing at all.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh yeah... Have you been keeping track of the moon phases each month, Arisato-kun?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Of course.   
Not at all.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Well, that's reassuring! Guess that's what makes you the leader.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I see... Well, it is a lot of work.   
But I hope you can spare a minute to think about it every once in a while. It'll help us plan our days better.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The next full moon is coming up soon, so I should probably plan out my schedule, too.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
By the way, the next full moon will be on July 7th, the same day as Tanabata.   
Happy - Honestly, I have no idea what to expect for this upcoming battle...   
We'll just have to be ready for anything. Better to play it safe.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - We're just two days away from the next full moon...   
I still have no idea what kind of battle we should expect.   
Happy - But let's try to prepare ourselves the best we can. Better safe than sorry.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hmm... I'm not picking up any signs of a Shadow related to tomorrow's full moon...   
Sad - Looks like we just have to wait until it appears tomorrow.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um, so about last night's operation...   
Did something happen between you and Yukari-chan?   
Happy - Yukari-chan has been acting a little weird lately... I just hope nothing's bothering her.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I think it's wonderful that Kirijo-senpai is so passionate about her cause...   
Sad - But being too passionate can cause people around you to feel confused. It's a difficult balancing act...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Maybe we shouldn't go to Tartarus tonight...   
Junpei-kun asked me to go over what we talked about in the meeting...   
   
Junpei Iori   
But if we defeat all twelve Shadows...   
I won't be able to use my Persona anymore.   
Sad - Man, it's such an amazing power... I can't just let it go to waste...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Maybe we should hold off on going to Tartarus tonight, too. Looks like everyone is studying in their own rooms.   
Sad - ......   
Sad - They're all keeping to themselves because they're busy studying... Right?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's right.   
I hope so...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - In that case... once exams are over, everything should go back to normal.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Me too... I can't stop thinking about it.   
Sad - What if they're hiding in their rooms because of something else...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I'm so excited for the trip.   
I've only read about Yakushima in textbooks...   
Happy - A short while ago, I wouldn't have been able to even fathom traveling together with everyone...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Kirijo-senpai and Sanada-senpai aren't here, so I don't think we can go to Tartarus tonight.   
Since we'll be leaving for the trip tomorrow, I think I'll call it a day now.   
Sad - Oh... Um, by the way, do you think Yukari-chan is doing all right?   
Sad - We went shopping for swimsuits this afternoon, but she looked pretty down the entire time...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Everyone seems worn out. You must be exhausted too, Arisato-kun.   
Happy - Let's not go to Tartarus tonight and just rest instead.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Kirijo-senpai is incredible...   
She scored so well on her exams even though so much has been happening...   
She can filter out all distractions and focus on the task at hand... I wish I could do that, too.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I think Amada-kun would get upset if he heard me say this, but... don't you think he's kind of adorable?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, I guess so.   
Not really.   
Isn't he kinda precocious?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Heehee, I wonder if this is what it's like to have a little brother.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh...   
Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself? It's just... the thought of having a little brother made me really happy.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Heehee, that's what's so great about him. It's kind of like having a little brother.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - If Amada-kun were actually my little brother, I think I'd forgive him no matter what he gets up to.   
Happy - But he's pretty mature, so I'm sure he wouldn't go looking for trouble.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - If this country falls apart, what will happen then...?   
Sad - Would a war or something break out?   
Surprised - I probably shouldn't think too hard on this... I mean, we're fighting to prevent that from happening.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um, you know the incident that occurred because of the Kirijo Group's experiments?   
They said it happened because they were trying to collect Shadows.   
Doesn't that mean Shadows existed before Tartarus and the Dark Hour ever appeared?   
How long have Shadows been around then...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
As I said earlier, we shouldn't go to Tartarus today.   
I know you want to go because there's going to be a full moon soon, but...   
It'd be better not to...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I hope this is just nothing, but...   
Doesn't it seem like more people have been coming down with Apathy Syndrome compared to last month?   
Let's work hard so that everyone can go back to living a normal life again.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I heard Koro-chan is going to be fine... That's such a relief.   
Do you think the priest who passed away protected him?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I think so.   
I don't know.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - The bond between a person and their pet is truly wonderful...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I'd like to believe that the priest did, I really do.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I heard you're done with the competition, Arisato-kun.   
You must be tired, right? Maybe we shouldn't go to Tartarus, then. Go get some rest.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Last month's operation didn't go so smoothly because the enemy behaved unexpectedly...   
So I'm doing some visualization training and exercises to ensure that doesn't happen again.   
I'll do my best to support everyone!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - We have to win this time, too.   
Happy - I'll give it everything I've got... so that I can see Koro-chan again now that he's gotten better.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Everyone seems so exhausted...   
We don't have the whole group here anyway, so let's skip going to Tartarus tonight.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Lucia couldn't detect those people... Strega, I think?   
They must be very powerful to be able to slip past her.   
Just who in the world are they...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
By the way, what are we going to do about Koro-chan's meals?   
Are we going to buy dog food or cook homemade meals for him? We should decide soon.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I get not wanting to attend summer school, but I think it's necessary.   
After we defeat the rest of the Shadows, we'll become ordinary high school students again.   
And if we fall behind in our studies now, we'll be in big trouble later.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I wonder if Koro-chan is enjoying dorm life...   
I really hope he'll get used to it and then come to love it one day.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Kirijo-senpai and Sanada-senpai aren't around, so I don't think we can go to Tartarus tonight.   
I know we haven't been going very often because of summer school, but... we don't have much of a choice in the matter.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Come to think of it... there'll be a summer festival at the shrine today.   
Sad - I've already made plans with a friend, so I can't go...   
Maybe I'll ask if we could go to the festival together next year.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I know Koro-chan didn't mean to hurt Yukari-chan's feelings.   
Sad - But... I'm sure she's feeling a little down...   
Sad - I'm not sure what to do in this kind of situation...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We should follow Yukari-chan's advice and try to finish our summer homework soon.   
Junpei-kun said he's going to do his all at once later... How are you gonna tackle yours, Arisato-kun?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
All at once.   
Little by little.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh, you too? I guess everyone has their own way of doing things.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I think that's the best strategy to do homework, too.   
Happy - That's what I've been doing, so I've gotten most of it out of the way already.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, that reminds me... I hope Natsuki-chan isn't struggling with her homework.   
She told me that she left all her textbooks at school... I better check in on her later.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
A lot of people have been writing about the Lost in their blogs lately.   
We have to defeat the four remaining Shadows and stop the damage they're causing society.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I've heard about that, too.   
A girl wrote about the suffering she experienced when she was one of the Lost... And some guy posted that his parents were victims.   
Sad - More people are affected now...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The number of people falling victim to Shadows is increasing again.   
We have to defeat the remaining four Shadows... no matter what.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exploring Tartarus and defeating Shadows are both important... but so is doing summer homework.   
In fact, doing homework may be even more of a priority because of the due date...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exactly. Did you get that, Junpei?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - 'Course I did! Who do you think I am?   
...Alright, ya got me! I haven't even started!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - ......   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Stop! Don't look at me with such disappointment in your eyes!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I heard something interesting from a TV show the other day...   
Happy - You know how you have no appetite when it's hot out? Well, eating ice cream could actually make heat exhaustion set in.   
Sometimes, I only have ice cream for lunch... I need to be more careful about that.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Amada-kun seemed a bit lethargic...   
Sad - I wonder... Could it be heat exhaustion? Since it's been really hot lately?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Junpei-kun and Amada-kun look like brothers, don't they?   
Happy - Junpei-kun is the silly older brother, and Amada-kun is the reliable younger brother.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Hey now, don'tcha mean "the super cool, reliable older brother"?   
But havin' a kid brother doesn't sound so bad. You think I could get him to call me "big bro"?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Sanada-senpai has been acting a little strange lately, don't you think?   
Sad - Maybe it's difficult for him to watch Amada-kun put himself in danger...   
Despite appearances, I think that, deep down inside, Sanada-senpai is actually a really kind person...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I gave Aigis some winter clothes to wear so she's covered up.   
Happy - I hope she won't be too hot in them.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Aragaki-senpai seems scary, but I think he's just misunderstood...   
I doubt that he's a bad guy... I mean, he used to fight alongside Sanada-senpai and Kirijo-senpai.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I still don't know Aragaki-san all that well...   
But for some reason, I feel like I can depend on him. I guess because he's used to fighting Shadows?   
I'll work harder, too, so that I can support our team better.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Remember how Lucia couldn't detect Strega when we encountered them last time?   
I think one of Medea's skills prevented me from sensing them...   
We only saw two of them, but that girl must have been somewhere close.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There are so many things we don't understand about Chidori...   
It's also bizarre that Lucia couldn't sense her...   
Sad - She's not mentally stable right now. I can't imagine what it's like... to harm your own body.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I'm glad Junpei-kun is back to normal.   
Sad - But... do you think his relationship with Chidori-san will work out?   
Sad - She's a member of Strega, and they're our enemies.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
They'll be okay.   
I have no idea.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I really hope so.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Just when they were starting to get along... It's such an ironic twist of fate.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I'm so happy Aragaki-senpai joined us... He's really made things easier on us.   
But we shouldn't let him do all the hard work either, or else we won't grow stronger.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Wow... You're actually for real.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Of course she is, what's so shocking about that? You should learn from her example.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Junpei-kun really cares about Chidori-san a lot, doesn't he?   
Happy - I'd only ever seen him goofing around, but...   
Happy - Now he seems like such a gentleman.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - You're all wet! Are you all right? You don't look so good...   
Sad - I don't think you should go to Tartarus tonight. Stay home and rest instead.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yamagishi's right. You should take care of yourself.   
I doubt anyone would want to go to Tartarus in all this wind and rain, anyway.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I'm glad you're feeling better now.   
But don't push yourself too hard, okay? You might catch another cold.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm glad you weren't sick for very long.   
Happy - Maybe it's because you rested for two days straight.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
If the Dark Hour disappears...   
We'll probably lose our Persona abilities and return to being ordinary high school students, right?   
Oh, but I guess we won't be the same as we were before.   
Happy - Because of everything we experienced together, we'll all live richer, fuller lives.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I wonder what a day in Aragaki-senpai's life is like.   
Since we don't see him at school... He doesn't seem like he would want to talk about it either.   
I know I'm just being nosy, but I can't help being curious.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Amada-kun seems so depressed lately... I wonder what's wrong...   
Sad - It's hard to tell.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm still worried about Amada-kun...   
Sad - I think something has been bothering him these days... I just wish he'd open up to us about it.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hm, that's gonna be tough... He seems like the type who'll always try to figure things out on their own.   
Sad - I'd be more than willing to help him, though... Especially if something's wrong.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The third-years are all really amazing.   
Even though we're coming up on our final battles with the Shadows, they don't look nervous at all.   
Or maybe they're just trying to be considerate and are hiding their nerves... But that just makes them even more reliable.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The device in the command room logs when it's been booted up, but no issues have been found.   
The TV appears to share a remote with something else, so that's why it turns on by itself sometimes...   
Perhaps... someone uses the same remote in a different room?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - It's already October...   
It was just summer not too long ago... It feels like time passes by really quickly.   
Maybe because we've been busy with the full moons and Shadows.   
Ever since I moved into the dorm, everything seems to be happening all at once.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Just three large Shadows left...   
We should be ready for the unexpected.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I'm the worst...   
Sad - I lost my temper and snapped at Yukari-chan...   
Sad - It's just... I'm really worried about Amada-kun.   
Sad - I know what it feels like not having a place to belong...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
A lot's happened today, so why don't we pass up a trip to Tartarus?   
We can get back to business tomorrow—with Amada-kun, too, of course.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - He was with us just a short while ago... I can't believe we won't see him ever again.   
I knew there was always this risk, but...   
Sad - Sorry, I... I'm still a little shaken up. I can't think straight.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Arisato-kun, have you been studying for the exams?   
Sad - Sometimes, I can't stop thinking about Aragaki-senpai...   
Even though I know I shouldn't be dwelling on what happened...   
Right now, we just have to focus on our midterms.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We have tomorrow off for Health and Sports Day.   
But since it's the day before the midterms, I'll probably just be studying the whole day.   
Maybe I'll squeeze in a walk or something. It's not good to focus too much on only one thing.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Phew... We're finally done with exams. I don't think I did very well this time...   
I had a hard time remembering some terms and formulas...   
How do you think you did, Arisato-kun?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Same as always.   
Not so great.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - That's great. Then I guess you don't have to worry about your grades.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, you too? Let's make up for it during our finals.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I've never felt so unsatisfied about my exam performance... I'll have to study extra hard for finals.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Have you seen the exam results?   
Mine actually weren't as bad as I thought they'd be, but... I feel like I could've done much better.   
Sad - It made me realize that I'm still stewing over all sorts of things.   
I have to keep it together...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
So... Natsuki-chan is moving away. I'm honestly really depressed about it.   
But I also know that, no matter the distance, she'll always be right here with me.   
Happy - Nothing can come between the bond we share... So I'll be all right.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
What will I do when the Dark Hour disappears? Hmm... I don't know...   
I guess I'll try to fix my sleeping habits.   
Happy - I always stay up really late on the nights we go to Tartarus...   
   
Koromaru   
*whine*   
   
Ken Amada   
You too, Koromaru? But... you can sleep any time you want, can't you?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sometimes, when I'm surfing the web...   
I like to think about how the Internet can help us form bonds with other people.   
We normally don't pay it any mind, but we connect to others and form bonds when searching for information online.   
Oh, sorry. That was pretty random, wasn't it? I just wanted to share my thoughts with someone.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - The operation was a success, but the Lost's numbers haven't gone down at all...   
But we're almost done. Peace will return to this city soon.   
I need to prepare myself for our final battle.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm starting to get nervous for our next battle this upcoming full moon...   
Happy - B-But at times like this, it's best to keep a cool head!   
Happy - So let's just stay calm and go for the win!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I think it's for the best if we skip going to Tartarus tonight. Not everyone is here, so...   
Sad - I doubt anyone would want to go anyway...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It sounds like there aren't any major issues with Aigis... What a relief.   
Sad - But I wonder if she's doing okay... I hope she doesn't feel guilty or anything.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
She'll be fine.   
You worry too much.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Yeah, you're right.   
Happy - That's really reassuring, coming from you.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - Y-You think so...?   
But I guess you're right... Maybe I'm just paranoid. I'm sure Aigis will be fine.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The chairman was always telling us lame jokes... Do you think that was even his real personality?   
Sad - Or was he just faking it this entire time, pretending everything was normal...?   
Sad - I wonder if he even enjoyed his time here...   
   
Aigis   
No one knows, not anymore. The answers shall elude us, now and forever.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Who cares...? All we need to know is that he betrayed us.   
Angry - I'll never forgive him for using my father...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um, what was his name...? Ryoji...? Ryoji Mochizuki? That sounds right. Anyway, I saw him in the hallway.   
He has a very strange aura about him...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - ...I'm worried about Kirijo-senpai.   
Sad - She's usually so calm and level-headed. I can't bear to see her this way...   
I hope the school trip will cheer her up...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I was just speaking with Yukari-chan earlier.   
Did you know that she used to live in Kyoto?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I knew that.   
I didn't know that.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Maybe we can ask her to be our tour guide.   
...Or would that be rude?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I didn't know either until I asked her myself.   
Surprised - Yukari-chan sounds like she's from around here, but I wonder if she'll speak with an accent in Kyoto.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I wonder what it's like to live in Kyoto...   
You can't really experience living with so much history and culture here...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It must be really difficult to bounce back from such a painful incident...   
But the school trip only happens once, so I really hope she can make some good memories there.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, I know. But...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm sure everyone's exhausted today, so let's go to Tartarus some other time.   
Happy - Heehee, I had a lot of fun on the school trip. Did you?   
Happy - We visited so many beautiful places... And I really enjoyed the hot spring.   
Which reminds me, we heard something when we were soaking. A monkey probably snuck in...   
Surprised - Um, are you listening, Arisato-kun? You're sweating... Are you okay?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There's only one thing I have to say to you.   
Angry - Everyone is exhausted from the trip, so we're not going to explore Tartarus tonight.   
Angry - That's all. Goodnight.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Junpei-kun has been showing Ryoji-kun around school since he's still pretty new.   
Happy - I guess Junpei-kun has his sweet side, too.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I know nobody wants to do it, but it's something that has to be done.   
Perseverance is important, especially once we becoming working adults.   
If you think of this as a chance to nurture that skill, then career experience would be easier to get through. Don't you think so, too?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I see your point.   
I don't think I can do it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm sure it won't be easy, but we just have to endure it for four days. Let's do our best.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Well, either way, career experience week is mandatory, so let's just do our best.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Kirijo-senpai and Sanada-senpai won't be back till later tonight.   
So let's not go to Tartarus tonight.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Looking away - Junpei-kun and Chidori-san had such a beautiful connection...   
Sad - Even now, they're still together, but...   
Sad - I never thought it would end like this... It's too tragic.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Do you think Junpei-kun participated in career experience week?   
Sad - Hopefully, he didn't coop himself up somewhere...   
Sad - It's so hard to tell what everyone's doing outside of school...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
After being separated from Natsuki-chan, I know for certain that the bonds we share will never disappear.   
I think the same is true for Junpei-kun and Chidori-san.   
Chidori-san may no longer be around... but the bond between them will always exist.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Don't you think Aigis has been acting differently lately?   
Sad - She seems to be worried about something...   
It makes me a bit uneasy... I hope it's just my imagination.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There's a full moon tonight, so I'll be up keeping an eye on things with Juno, just in case.   
So let's go to Tartarus another night, okay?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - ......   
Sad - So, we're all going to die...   
Sad - No matter how much we want to live, there's no escaping death...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - With everything going on, I don't think we'll be able to go to Tartarus for a while.   
I need to sort my thoughts, too... Oh, but did you want to ask me something?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
The surge in Persona-users   
My existence   
The twelve Shadows reviving   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
According to Ryoji-kun, the reason there are more Persona-users is because of your existence.   
You came here with Ryoji-kun inside you, bringing us all together...   
Along with the Shadows that had been dispersed to different locations.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um, from what Ryoji-kun said...   
Ten years ago, you happened to be present when Aigis and Ryoji-kun were fighting.   
Aigis couldn't defeat Ryoji-kun, so she decided to seal him inside you.   
......   
Sad - To have such a thing done to you...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
When you moved here...   
Ryoji-kun began to awake from inside you... and the twelve Shadows started making their move.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
...I wanted to hear Natsuki-chan's voice, so I called her.   
She could tell that I was worried about something and asked me what was wrong.   
Sad - But how could I tell her that the world's going to end soon?   
Sad - I just don't know what to do...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I was thinking about what Strega has been saying this whole time...   
It reminds me a little of what Ryoji-kun was talking about.   
Sad - So they must've known something about the Fall...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - It's so frustrating.   
Sad - It feels like we're being laughed at...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - There's nothing we can do about it now... Let's just concentrate on Nyx.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I don't usually feel this way, but I'm kind of glad we have exams soon...   
Sad - Because when I'm studying, I don't have to think about what'll happen to us...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I wonder if Ryoji-kun will really come back for New Year's Eve...   
What is he doing now...? Is he crying, like before?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I was thinking about the connection between what Ikutsuki-san and Ryoji-kun both told us...   
And then, everything finally made sense.   
Ikutsuki-san made us fight the twelve Shadows in hopes that the Appriser would return...   
And by doing so, he managed to fuse Ryoji-kun, who was inside you, with the twelve Shadows.   
And that's when Ryoji-kun appeared to us as the Appriser, in a completed form.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There's a lot to think about, but we still have to study for our exams.   
Sad - Or, rather, I feel like I'll go crazy if I don't.   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - Wow, Fuuka-san... You're a really serious student.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - I know what you mean... as much as I hate to admit it.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - That's fine. It's probably for the best.   
In fact, getting back into your routine might help you think more clearly when the day comes.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I studied extra hard this time, so I have a feeling I'll be okay.   
How about you, Arisato-kun? How do you think you did on the exams?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Aced them.   
Pretty bad.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh, that's wonderful. I think I did pretty well, too.   
But I skipped some questions I didn't know the answers to... I'll have to review them later.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Well, that's understandable, considering the situation we're in.   
Happy - Just review the questions you didn't know, and you'll be fine next time.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I can't get both the Fall and Nyx out of my head...   
Happy - But studying for the exams helped me take my mind off matters for a little while.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, it's almost Christmas.   
Arisato-kun, what do you think the real meaning of Christmas is?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Peace on earth.   
Joy to the world.   
Consumerism.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - That's one way to look at it. I have a similar mindset, actually.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - That's what I think too.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Um, I guess from a business perspective, that's true... But still, that's kind of sad.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I believe that the Christmas spirit should put a smile on everyone's faces.   
Happy - So let's be happy, too!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - It's Christmas! It's the season of good cheer, so let's try to enjoy ourselves.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - The exam results are out, so that's one less thing for us to worry about.   
Now, what should I do for Christmas...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - ...What is it?   
Sad - I, um... don't have anything to say right now, so...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Whether or not this will be our last Christmas—   
   
Oh, I probably shouldn't think that way.   
Sad - Anyway, Christmas only ever comes once a year, so let's enjoy it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I wonder how Ryoji-kun spent his Christmas...   
Did he try to chat up some girls and have fun?   
Sad - Or... did he spend it alone, crying, like the last time we saw him?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I bet he had fun.   
He might have cried.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Yeah, I hope you're right...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I can't believe we're considering kill—   
   
Sad - We have to stand firm...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I read that fear is an emotional response that triggers us to flee from danger.   
But nothing will change if we keep running away from the things we're scared of.   
We all have to face our fears... so that we can find a way to survive.   
Arisato-kun... I've made up my mind.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Only three days left...   
It's not like my fear's up and disappeared, but... for some reason, I feel at ease.   
I think it's because everyone is standing here with me.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
They said Aigis was coming back because she was all fixed up...   
But I have a feeling it wasn't just a regular repair job.   
I believe she's come back to us as a whole new person.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I know what my answer is. I will keep moving forward...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Honestly, I'm terrified of the Fall, but... my determination to face it head-on is greater than my fear.   
I hope the others feel the same way, too.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - It always feels like the new year brings new beginnings.   
I'll use all my newfound energy to work hard and restore peace to the city!   
So, um... let's make this a great year!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I heard that cult held a meeting recently.   
Sad - Why'd they have to do it right after the new year? I really hope it doesn't give people any weird ideas...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The cult keeps preaching about salvation and deliverance...   
But the meaning of salvation is different from person to person.   
There are those who desire riches, who want to buy what they need, who wish for world peace...   
Just what does that cult think their salvation is...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Just as expected, the cult's influence has reached our school...   
Some people seem to be fully devoted to it.   
Sad - We need to do something about Nyx.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Whether or not you believe in the cult is a personal decision...   
I would never believe in it myself.   
When I think of my friendship with Natsuki-chan, I have no need to join the cult.   
   
Aigis   
The bond of friendship...   
Though this may sound cliché, I believe the ability to forge bonds is the most beautiful thing about being human.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
In the end, the most important things are the bonds formed between people.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - That's right... No matter how much power someone has, nobody can survive alone.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I've seen the username "Jin" before...   
He's very popular and has a lot of support from his followers. He's a very charismatic figure.   
Sad - I can't believe he's the same Jin as the one from Strega...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Time really flies by...   
Let's spend the remaining eighteen days with no regrets.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Whenever I see followers of the cult...   
It just reminds me that there's no way I will ever devote myself to it.   
Even if I'm ever swayed to join, hearing Natsuki-chan's voice would snap me back to reality.   
...If only everyone could form a strong bond with someone. Then nobody would flock to that cult.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - *sniffle*   
Sad - Sorry... Every time I think about it, I start to tear up.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Do you remember that time we ordered sushi? Well, Koro-chan was the only one who couldn't have any.   
So I prepped a special dinner tonight just for Koro-chan.   
I hope it helps him grow stronger. And that he likes it, of course!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Career consultation is coming up. I've already decided on going to college...   
It wasn't a difficult decision to make. I mean, I couldn't think of anything I wanted to do besides study.   
But it's hardly a decision I can say I chose for the sake of my own future... is it?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Maybe.   
That's not true.   
I have no idea.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hmm... Maybe I should give it more thought, after all. I need to expand my horizons a bit...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Well, it might be fine for now, but I'll have to make a real decision someday.   
I need to have a broader outlook for my future.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I know we're free to choose our own paths... but that only makes it a more difficult decision.   
The possibilities are endless...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Maybe it's not too late to start researching and consulting people...   
Happy - It'd be nice to have a lot of options, especially since I'm the only one who can decide what to do with my future.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I understand how Junpei-kun feels, actually.   
Anything can seem like a big deal if you think it'll be the last time you get to do it...   
Isn't that kind of sad?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yes, it is.   
Not at all.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Right? It makes me want to protect our precious, ordinary days even more.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Oh, I see... You don't seem to be the sentimental type.   
Happy - But I'm sure we both feel like we have to protect our ordinary days though, right?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Right now, Natsuki-chan is somewhere far from here, doing her best in life.   
Happy - That gives me the strength to carry on and never give up.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I was reviewing everything to prep for tonight when Aigis took me out for a breather.   
I think I'll keep at it after taking a short break.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Don't push yourself too hard.   
We're counting on you.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Heehee, thanks. I've got Aigis with me, so I'll be fine.   
Happy - I can't fight on the front lines... So I want to be able to provide everyone with the perfect support.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Mhm! Just leave it to me!   
Happy - Thanks to everyone's efforts, I can focus on doing what I can.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
If the world ends, our bonds of friendship will disappear, too... I don't want that to happen.   
There are still a lot of people I want to meet and befriend.   
That's why I won't let the world end today.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's a great thing to do.   
Think of yourself first.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I feel like that's what I'm meant to do...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Amada-kun didn't seem well.   
Sad - Maybe he came down with heat exhaustion, like Junpei-kun...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Fuuka seems worried.   
I doubt she's in the mood   
to go to the movies...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Amada-kun joining us yesterday was a surprise...   
I think he wasn't sure how to bring it up...   
Happy - But I'm glad he's looking better now.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Fuuka seems relieved.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel as if we can grow closer thanks to the   
 Persona, ****...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I invite Fuuka to the film festival?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Invite to the movies   
Check Social Link status   
Don't invite   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - You want to go with me?   
Happy - Okay... Sure.   
Happy - I was actually thinking about going because the theme today seems interesting.   
Happy - This will be fun!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Fuuka seems happy.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I invite Fuuka to the film festival?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Invite to the movies   
Don't invite   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - You want to go with me?   
Happy - Okay... Sure.   
Happy - I was actually thinking about going because the theme today seems interesting.   
Happy - I'm glad to have someone to go with.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I really enjoyed myself yesterday.   
Happy - With so many films on one ticket, the price ended up being very low.   
Happy - Is Iwatodai the only place that holds festivals like this?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Summer vacation will be over soon... I had a great time at the film festival.   
I ended up going by myself...   
Happy - It was even more crowded than I expected, so I was a little nervous... But the movies were so interesting!   
Happy - I hope there's another film festival next year.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It seems Fuuka already   
went to the film festival...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, good morning.   
Did you know there's a one-day-only film festival today?   
The promoter said demand was so high they decided to hold another one. I guess people liked it!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Right now, the Temperance Arcana   
may help me grow even more...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um... Did you need something?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Come to think of it, Elizabeth asked   
me to get a specific item for her...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Huh...? A Christmas star?   
Surprised - That's... the ornament at the top of the tree, right?   
Sad - Why do you need one of those...?   
...Oh. If I'm right, it might not refer to an ornament at all.   
There's a type of plant that's sometimes called the "Christmas Star."   
Happy - Could you wait a few minutes? I'll go double-check.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Sorry for the wait! Here you go.   
Happy - I think what you're looking for is a poinsettia.   
Happy - This flower is usually sold during Christmastime, so it'd be hard to find in stores now.   
Happy - Fortunately, I had some in my room. Here you go.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um... Can I help you?

Let's talk.   
What's everyone's status?   
Let's go to Tartarus.   
Never mind.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
All right. Then let's meet in the usual place.   
I'll let the others know. See you there.

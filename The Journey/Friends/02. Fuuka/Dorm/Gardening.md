Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um, Arisato-kun... How are the rooftop planters doing?   
I don't know much about gardening, but I'm kind of curious...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um, Arisato-kun... Is it all right if I help tend to the rooftop planters, too?   
I've actually been interested in gardening for a while now. If you don't mind, could I join you?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The quality of the produce might improve if   
we tend to the rooftop planters together.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
So, um... is it okay if I help out?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That'd be great.   
That won't be necessary.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, Arisato-kun... How are the rooftop planters doing?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The quality of the produce might improve if   
we tend to the rooftop planters together.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Can I help with your gardening again?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That'd be great.   
That won't be necessary.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um I'd like to check on the rooftop planters today, if possible.   
Happy - Do you have some time right now, Arisato-kun?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Fuuka seems determined...   
The quality of the produce might improve if   
we tend to the rooftop planters together.   
Fuuka might gain a new ability soon...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Is that all right? Could we check on them together?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's do it.   
Not now.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Do you want to go check on the rooftop planters together?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It doesn't seem like Fuuka will gain any   
more new skills even if she helps me garden.   
But the quality of the produce might improve   
if we tend to the rooftop planters together.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I can spare some time today, so if there's anything I can help with, let me know.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's do it.   
Not now.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Okay! Let's head to the rooftop, then.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, okay... See you around.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, did you change your mind...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It doesn't seem like Fuuka will gain any   
more new skills even if she helps me garden.   
But the quality of the produce might improve   
if we tend to the rooftop planters together.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts

Fuuka is working silently...   
   
Internal MES - MND_001_0_0   
I tended the rooftop planters with Fuuka...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I bet these taste really good when they're freshly harvested.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Wow, they've gotten so big since we last saw them.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - The smell of the soil really makes it feel like we're growing something, doesn't it?   
   
Internal MES - MND_005_0_0   
Thanks to the care we put in, it   
looks like this will be a big harvest.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I think that about does it.   
Happy - Shall we head back downstairs?   
   
-----   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Whew... So this is what it's like growing plants.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, should we be measuring the pH of the soil, or monitoring how much sunlight they're getting...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You seem really into this.   
We don't need to go that far.   
pH...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh, um... Yes.   
Happy - I looked up a bunch of stuff online. I thought it might be helpful.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - ...Oh, right. I guess we don't have to get so technical for just a rooftop garden.   
Happy - When I started looking things up online, I might've gotten a bit carried away...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um... It's like, a measurement of acidity or alkalinity?   
Depending on the plants you're growing, the soil needs to be a certain value.   
Happy - I looked up a bunch of stuff online. I thought it might be helpful.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I do like flowers and stuff, but I've never really worked with them outside of arrangements.   
Happy - I've always wanted to try putting in the work to grow some though!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to go on about myself like that.   
Happy - Shall we keep working for a bit more? I'll go get some water.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I tended the rooftop planters with Fuuka...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - This looks good.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Thanks to the care we put in, it   
looks like this will be a big harvest.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Do you think you could invite me when you tend the plants again?   
Happy - I'll do more research so I'm in a better position to help out next time too!   
   
-----   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Huh? There are white spots on the leaves here...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I think I've seen something like this in a book at the library. It might be a common disease in vegetables and flowers.   
Sad - Wh-What do we do, Arisato-kun!? What if the plants die...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Just stay calm.   
How did the book say to fix it?   
They're doomed.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Y-Yes, you're right. This is exactly what I did all that reading for...   
From what I can tell, it doesn't look too serious yet. If we take care of it now, it should be all right.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Wha— Oh, right! If we take care of it now, it might not be a problem.   
From what I can tell, it doesn't look too serious yet. Um, what did the book say...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - N-No! We put in so much work...   
Sad - The book said if you take care of it right away, they'll get better!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We just need to cut off the white parts, and... That's right, vinegar!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It said to put some diluted vinegar on the affected areas. I'll go get some from downstairs!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I tended the rooftop planters with Fuuka...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - ...I think that's about everything we can do.   
We've picked up the fallen leaves, and the air circulation is good now too.   
Everything should be fine now. All that's left is to trust they can recover...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Thanks to the care we put in, it   
looks like this will be a big harvest.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Thank you for today, Arisato-kun.   
Happy - I wouldn't have been able to save the plants if you hadn't been here.   
Happy - I'm still a little worried, but... please let me help out again sometime.

-----   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Yes, this looks good.   
Just to be safe, we should adjust the amount of fertilizer and make sure they get enough sun.   
Happy - They look like they're growing fine now. What a relief...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's all thanks to you, Fuuka.   
I worked hard too.   
It's too early to relax.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh, I only lent a helping hand. I'm sure tending them is important...   
Happy - But it's all thanks to the plants themselves for being so strong.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Of course. They wouldn't be this healthy without you taking such good care of them.   
Happy - That's why they've grown up to be so strong!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
That's true. If we get a streak of bad weather, they might get sick again.   
It sure is a lot of work to raise healthy plants...   
Happy - But I think they'll be fine if we make sure to look after them.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You know, after I treated the plants when they were sick, I kept coming back here to check on them.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I noticed that the spots where we had cut off the leaves were already sprouting new ones.   
And in just a little while, they were healthy and green all over again!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Maybe I'm making a big deal of this, but it made me realize that life is actually quite amazing.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - It didn't matter that they had been weakened, or had damaged parts...   
Happy - Just giving them a little support was enough for them to show how strong they really are.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
We could learn from this.   
Let's keep at it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Yes, it really gave me hope. I think in a lot of ways, we're just like them.   
Happy - I'm not sure how to say it, but... I hope I can be as resilient as these plants are.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Yes. If we hadn't had to take care of them like this, I never would have noticed.   
Happy - I'm not sure how to say it, but... I hope I can be as resilient as these plants are.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Fuuka is looking tenderly at the   
plants we've grown together.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I think I'll check on the plants one more time, just to show my appreciation.   
Happy - Maybe if I keep thanking them, they'll grow even healthier.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - All right, that should do it. Shall we head back down?

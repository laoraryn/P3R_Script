Fuuka Yamagishi
Um... Do you like to read books, Arisato-kun?
You see... there's this near-future sci-fi series that was popular a while back.
I found it at a used bookstore and bought the whole series, but it's been sitting on my shelf for a long time.
Happy - I only started reading it after moving into the dorm, and it's really interesting.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - If you're interested, would you like to read the first book?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's read together.
Not now.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Do you want to continue reading that sci-fi series together?
Um, if you're not too busy, I mean.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Wh-What do you think?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's read together.
Not now.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Arisato-kun, you're almost done reading that sci-fi series, right?
Happy - Um... Do you want to read together today?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It seems like Fuuka is looking
forward to hanging out.
Reading sci-fi novels with Fuuka could

Fuuka might gain a new ability soon...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I was hoping we could have a little discussion after you've finished reading it.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's read together.
Not now.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Actually, I brought more books from my home...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It doesn't seem like Fuuka will gain any
more new skills even if we read together.
But reading sci-fi novels with her could
help with my .

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Wh-What do you think? Do you want to read more books together?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's read together.
Not now.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Glad to hear it! Okay, I'll go get them from my room.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Oh... You're probably busy, right? Sorry to bother you.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Um... Do you still want to read together?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It doesn't seem like Fuuka will gain any
more new skills even if we read together.
But reading sci-fi novels with her could

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I enjoy reading novels with Fuuka.
Fuuka seems to be having fun too...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I don't know why, but I feel so calm when I have someone reading next to me.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I feel like my 
have improved thanks to the
skillful expression in the writing...

Fuuka Yamagishi
It's getting pretty late. Should we wrap up for the night?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Do you read a lot of science fiction novels like this, Arisato-kun?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I read them quite a bit.
I enjoy one here and there.
Not really.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, wow!
Happy - I guess it's good that I invited you today then.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I wonder what that exactly means. The core fanbase for the sci-fi genre can get pretty picky...
Happy - It's the ones who answer like you that turn out to be the hardcore fans.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh... But even if you aren't familiar with the genre, I think this series hooks people pretty easily.
Apparently, a lot of people get into sci-fi after they read this.

Fuuka Yamagishi
...Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt while you were reading.
Happy - If you don't mind, can you let me know your thoughts once you finish it?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, I didn't notice the time.
Surprised - How far did you get? ...Wow! You've read that much already?
Huh? I made a lot of progress too. Was I more focused than usual, or...?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I feel like my 
have improved thanks to the
skillful expression in the writing...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - ......
Happy - Um, if you don't mind... do you think we could read here again sometime?
Happy - I used to think reading was only a solo activity.
Happy - But now, I think reading with someone helps me immerse myself deeper into the fictional world.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I'm here whenever I can spare the time, so come by if you can. I'd be happy to have you.
Happy - All right, that's enough for today. Good night, Arisato-kun.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - So the other day I recommended the novel I'm reading to a classmate...
Happy - I don't talk to her much, but at the time we were discussing a movie we'd both seen.
Happy - She wasn't too keen on the recommendation and turned me down, though.
Happy - It was because the series looked hard to get into. There are so many volumes.

Minato Arisato - Selection
She's missing out.
Can't really blame her.
It's about presentation.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - If she just gave it a chance, I know she would see how interesting it is.
Happy - The basic premise is about journeying to other planets, and even that by itself already sounds intriguing.
Happy - And the writing is so unique and poetic. I can't help but get sucked in...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I know. I'd probably feel the same way.
Happy - It's hard for someone to pick up a series that's been going on for so long.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Presentation? You mean like, talking in front of a group of people...?
Hmm, interesting... So you think I should have slides or something to go with it?
I could probably show them in a room with a projector, or— Wait, that's not what you meant, is it?

Fuuka Yamagishi
...Recommending something to someone is a really tricky thing, huh?
Well, thank you anyways, Arisato-kun. I appreciate you showing interest in that book.
Okay, I think I'll read a little further myself.

Fuuka Yamagishi
......
Whew... I finished the whole thing.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I feel like my 
have improved thanks to the
skillful expression in the writing...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Time flies by so quickly. Let me know your thoughts on it next time.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Well then, good night.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, Arisato-kun. Did you finish reading the final volume?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - You looked really focused when you were reading. I can definitely relate.
Happy - When I got to the end, I was so absorbed that I almost forgot to breathe.

Fuuka Yamagishi
What an amazing series...
I didn't notice at first, but at some point I could suddenly just make sense of the complex setting. Isn't it weird how that works?

Minato Arisato - Selection
It's like magic.
It's written well.
I skipped the complicated parts.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, it really does feel that way, doesn't it?
Happy - They do say advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Maybe going in with that mindset makes sci-fi a little less intimidating.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Right. If it was just straight exposition, it would be exhausting trying to keep track of everything.
Being able to tie the world-building into the narrative really shows how skilled the author is.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Ah, I actually do that a lot too...
Sometimes you don't understand it on your first read, but as you continue on, it all starts to come together.

Fuuka Yamagishi
...I wish I could communicate as well as the author does in this book.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Remember when I told you how I recommended a book to a classmate, but she turned me down?
Knowing what to say is important, but how you say it is difficult too.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Before I could tell her how fascinating the story is... I was telling her how many volumes it was and that it's written by a famous author...
I don't think that kind of information's going to persuade someone to read.

Minato Arisato - Selection
It'll go better next time.
That's a tough one.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - ...Thanks. Maybe I'll try talking to her again.
Happy - I think I'll have a lot of good things to say about this book now.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Right. It's so easy to fall back on information like that, like the number of copies sold, or the writer's prestige.
But if I want to explain how good a story is, I need to start with the emotions it evokes when you read it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - It always feels nice when someone shows an interest in something you like.
Happy - Even just sharing our opinions like this is so refreshing.

Fuuka Yamagishi
That's why I really want to work on how I communicate things.
Because if I do that, then maybe I'll get more fun moments like this.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Fuuka is nodding with determination.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, look at the time... We should probably call it a night.
...Um...
I have some other books I can recommend, if you'd like.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Thank you, Arisato-kun. I hope you'll like those too.
Happy - Well then, good night.

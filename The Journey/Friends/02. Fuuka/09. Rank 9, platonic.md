Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um... Please don't laugh at this, okay?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The other day, I let Yukari-chan try a new dish I made.   
She liked it so much, she ended up eating it all.   
So I told her it was meant to return the favor for what everyone's done for me.   
But she got really confused and asked me what favor this was about.   
It didn't seem like she had any idea what I was talking about, so I told her the whole story.   
And when I finished... she burst out laughing.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
She told me I didn't need to do anything like that.   
She said, "When you're friends, you don't keep score."   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
She's right.   
Ahaha! That's funny.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - Hey, I asked you not to laugh...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Honestly...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I've been lying this whole time. To you, and to myself...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I don't think it was actually ever about repaying everyone.   
I am grateful, but... that's not what I really wanted to say.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
What I really want... is just to be with everyone. Forever.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The truth ended up being so much simpler, and I just wanted to make that clear.   
I've just never had the confidence to be honest about my feelings.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
So I wanted to say I'm sorry. For dragging you into this lie.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - And...   
Sad - I know I don't really have the right to ask this, but...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I hope you and I can continue to be friends.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Of course.   
Here's to us.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - ...!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I guess it goes without saying at this point.   
Happy - But thank you anyway.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - ...!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Yes, here's to us.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I think I'm going to try and be more accepting of who I am.   
And I'm not going to tell myself I'm worthless anymore.   
Because I have such wonderful friends all around me now.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Fuuka revealed her honest feelings to me.   
It seems we've grown closer...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
...Would you maybe like to try cooking together sometime?   
I've never asked because I assumed I'd be wasting your time, but I've always wanted to try cooking with a friend.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure thing.   
I'm not very good at it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Yes! Thank you, Arisato-kun.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Don't worry. I'll be right here to back you up!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, but...   
If you see me doing something wrong, please let me know.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Hehe, I can't wait.   
Happy - And if we do a good job, it'd be nice if we could share what we made with everyone else.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I spent the day talking with Fuuka.   
I should head back to the dorm...

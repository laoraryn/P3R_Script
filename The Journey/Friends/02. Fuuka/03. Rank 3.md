Fuuka Yamagishi
Remember how I told you I wanted to improve my cooking?
Sad - Well, I've been trying a lot since then, but I can never seem to get the taste right.
I still don't have a feel for how much salt to add. How do you do it, Arisato-kun?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Just a dash or two.
I don't add salt.
Just dump in a ton.

Fuuka Yamagishi
A dash...?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, so speed is important? That makes a lot of sense, actually.
Happy - I've just been pouring it in slowly. I'll try and remember that.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - What!? Is that... okay?

Fuuka Yamagishi
I don't think I'm on that level yet, but I bet it helps bring out the natural flavors of the ingredients.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Hehe. I'd like to eat your cooking someday, Arisato-kun.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - R-Really?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - W-Wow, that's quite bold of you, Arisato-kun.
Happy - ...But you know, I feel like that could end up being really tasty. Maybe I'll give it a try next time.

Fuuka Yamagishi
To tell you the truth...
I was actually hoping I could make something you'd really like, Arisato-kun.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - But I don't think I'll be able to do that for a while.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Maybe cooking just isn't for me.
Sad - ......

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - O-Oh, sorry. I know you're just trying to help me, and all I'm doing is being negative.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Just take it slow.
Don't get discouraged already.
Practice makes perfect.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Thank you.
That really means a lot to me. I've never had someone be so supportive of me like this before.

Fuuka Yamagishi
You're right.
I'm never going to get better with that kind of attitude.
And they do say that failure is the mother of success. I'll keep working at it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
That's true.
I have only just started. I can't let this keep me down.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Maybe I should try taking notes. That might help me figure out what I'm doing wrong.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I actually have quite a lot of trouble staying optimistic about things.
In my head, I always imagine something going horribly wrong.
That's why sometimes I feel like giving up when I'm cooking.

Fuuka Yamagishi
But you know...
When I'm around you, or the rest of the team, I never think like that.
You've all given me so much confidence in myself.

Fuuka Yamagishi
So, I'm really thankful to be a member of SEES.
Happy - That's why I want to show you all my gratitude.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Fuuka is starting to trust me.
It seems we've grown closer...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Maybe I should watch one of those cooking shows on TV.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Actually... they might be a little too advanced for me.
The library might have some books for beginners though.
Hmm... But in that case, I can't really read while cooking. I wouldn't want to get the pages dirty.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Go to the bookstore.
I'll help you find something.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, right. I guess I could do that, but...
Sad - ......
Sad - I don't really like going to bookstores.

Fuuka Yamagishi
It's not a big deal, though.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, you don't mind?
But, hmm. I don't know...
If we're looking for books, that means we'd need to go to the bookstore.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - It's not a big deal or anything, but... I don't really like going to bookstores.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Oh my gosh, when did it get so late!? I have to go!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Um, the hair dryer burned out, so I was planning on fixing it.
But I was hoping to get it done before Yukari-chan and the others got back.
Sorry, do you mind if we up the pace on the way back?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I hurried back to the dorm with Fuuka...

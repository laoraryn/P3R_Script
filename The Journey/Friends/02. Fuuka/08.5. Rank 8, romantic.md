Fuuka Yamagishi
So, I tried putting my thoughts in order.
I was so confused last time, I couldn't find the right words.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I've said before, but I have a bad habit of thinking negatively. Like when I have a difficult time deciding on something.
But no one knows what the future holds.
No matter how much you prepare, you can never really be sure what'll happen.
So in situations like that, I think the most important thing you can do... is believe.
You have to think positively, and trust that the future will smile upon you.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - The thing is, I'm not sure I can do that.
Sad - I don't understand how it comes so naturally to everyone else.

Fuuka Yamagishi
How are you able to tell yourself that things will work out in the end?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I believe in myself.
It's just my personality.
I've never thought about it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, I see.

Fuuka Yamagishi
You really are strong, Arisato-kun.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sounds like it's just in your nature, I guess.

Fuuka Yamagishi
...You really are strong, Arisato-kun.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I get that.
You don't have to think about it because it just comes naturally to you.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I think...
I really admire that part of you, Arisato-kun.

Fuuka Yamagishi
So, um...
The reason I've been relying on you isn't just because you're our leader.
Sad - It's because... you're you.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - It needs to be you, Arisato-kun...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I understand Fuuka's heartfelt words.
It seems we've grown closer...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - You know, sometimes I think to myself.
Sad - Once I learn how to cook, and I've paid you back for your help...
Sad - Will that be the end of us spending time together like this?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Not at all.
We'll see each other in the dorm.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - ...Thank you.
Sad - But... I'm sure there are lots of other people who depend on you, right?
Sad - I can't get in the way of that.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sorry! I didn't mean to sound so depressed.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - But it wouldn't be the same. There's other people at the dorm...
Sad - And I know how everyone depends on you, Arisato-kun.
Sad - I can't get in the way of that.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sorry! I didn't mean to sound so depressed.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, look at the time. We should start heading back.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Hey, uh, do you mind if we make a small detour? I want to buy some ingredients.
I think I'll tackle making Koro-chan's dinner today.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I went shopping with Fuuka,
then headed home...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Are you ready to go, Arisato-kun?
Happy - Sorry if it sounds like I'm rushing you. I'm just nervous because I'm not used to stuff like this...

Fuuka Yamagishi
But really, it doesn't matter to me where we go.
Happy - ...As long as we're together, Arisato-kun.

I decided to spend
Christmas Eve with Fuuka...

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Wow, look at all the decorations...
Happy - And they're so elaborate too.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - ...Oh, over there! Those trees are made entirely of lights.
Happy - They're so beautiful...

Minato Arisato - Selection
They sure are.
So, what's next?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Brrr. It's a bit chilly, but I'm really glad we came.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Um...
Happy - It's just... such a wonderful night, isn't it?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Um, I'm not sure...
Sad - Sorry. I didn't really think about what to do after we got here...

Fuuka Yamagishi
I, um... I'm happy just being with you.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Should we go inside? It's getting a little cold out here.
I don't want you to catch a cold.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I talked with Fuuka for a long time.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I'm having such a good time today.
Happy - It's like a dream. I've come through here so many times before, but today it feels special.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, that's right, um...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - These are for you.
I was thinking of you when I made them.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
DEV: (Item name) received.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I was originally planning to bake a cake in the spirit of Christmas, but...
I'm not that good at baking yet, and I didn't want it to taste bad.

Fuuka Yamagishi
But, I think you'll really like these...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - So, um...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - New Year's Eve is just around the corner.
Sad - If I were still my old self, I wouldn't have wanted to think about that... Especially on a day like this.

Fuuka Yamagishi
But I'm a lot different now.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Now, I know that time is precious, and I don't want to give up on the future.
Meeting you was the best thing that ever happened to me...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Thank you for today.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Having you with me on this special day... I couldn't be happier.
Happy - ......

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I shared a tender moment with Fuuka...

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
It's almost midnight.

Fuuka Yamagishi
...Oh, but I guess we're not going to Tartarus tonight, huh? Kirijo-senpai said she didn't think everyone would be back in time.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - ...Um, I'm not boring you, am I? I know this is a special night you're choosing to spend with me.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - ...Oh, sorry, was that rude? I don't know what I'm saying.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - This is the first time I've ever done this for Christmas, so I think I'm just nervous.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - But really, I'm so happy to spend this night with you. I'll never forget it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Thank you for everything. Honestly, I feel like I rely on you so much.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - And not just because you're our leader. I mean for me, personally, because I...
I lo—


Fuuka Yamagishi
Ahhh, um, I meant— S-Sorry about that!
......

Fuuka Yamagishi
So, what should we do after this?

Fuuka Yamagishi
We still have some time left...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I spent time with Fuuka until night fell.

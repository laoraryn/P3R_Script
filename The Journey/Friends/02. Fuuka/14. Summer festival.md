Happy - Oh, I'm so glad there are other people here wearing yukatas.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Um, I don't stand out too much, do I?
I usually don't wear this kind of clothing, so I'm feeling a little uncomfortable...

Minato Arisato - Selection
You look great.
Don't worry about it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - R-Really?
Very happy* - ...Thank you.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - You're right.
Happy - I tend to worry too much about what other people think.
Happy - Thank you.

Fuuka Yamagishi
You know, wearing this has made me think. Yukatas are so light and airy.
They're perfect for the humid summers we have here in Japan.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Yukatas look so simple at first glance, but they're actually very elegantly-designed.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - ......
Sad - Sorry, I guess that's not really what people talk about at a festival, huh?

Fuuka Yamagishi
U-Umm...
Happy - Oh, it's about time for dinner.
Happy - Let's get something to eat from one of the food stalls.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Excuse me, may I have one order of takoyaki, please?

Takoyaki Vendor
Ya sure can!

Takoyaki Vendor
...Here you go, one order of takoyaki!
I threw in an extra one for ya. I hope you and your boyfriend enjoy it!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Oh, um, thank you...

Fuuka Yamagishi
She gave us an extra piece of takoyaki.
Happy - I guess we should eat then, Arisato-kun.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - ...!

Fuuka Yamagishi
It's a little too hot for me to eat it whole, but...
Happy - But it's so good!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - It tastes just like the takoyaki at Octopia, doesn't it?
......

Fuuka Yamagishi
Wait a minute... Do you think she's the same person?
......
Maybe they're twins...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Look at those masks.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - There are animal ones too.
There's a cat, a dog, and... an octopus?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, it's actually a hyottoko mask. So it's a man's face, not an animal.
Happy - These masks really set the mood for the festival, don't you think?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I've actually never had a chance to go to one of these before.
Happy - ...It was a lot of fun.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I decided to go back to the dorm.

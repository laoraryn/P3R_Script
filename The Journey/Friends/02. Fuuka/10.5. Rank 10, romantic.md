Fuuka Yamagishi   
Uh, um...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh, sorry if my room smells like food!   
It's because I taste test my cooking in here every once in a while.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I don't really know how my room smells anymore because I'm so used to it...   
Sad - Um, d-did you know out of our five senses, smell is the one that adapts the fastest, so, uh...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - ......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Sorry, I don't know what I'm talking about...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Are you nervous?   
You seem like your usual self.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Y-Yes. Sorry...   
Sad - It's just, um...   
Sad - This is the first time I've ever invited a boy to my room, so...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - R-Really?   
Well, I guess it is important to be yourself.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - ...Thank you.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um...   
Do you remember how I said I don't feel like I have the strength to believe in the future?   
Well, being with you has taught me why.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I think it's because I never finish anything I start.   
People who've never known happiness probably can't imagine themselves being happy in the future either...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
And that's how I was. I always used to quit before I could find out what good might come from something.   
I never had a future to look forward to.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
...But...   
I... finally realized how I really feel.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
And so, um...   
I felt like I needed to tell you.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Or rather, I wanted to tell you.   
No matter how it might change things between us.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - You know, I think I have what it takes to change. Slowly but surely.   
Happy - As long as I have you... I don't think I'll lose my way.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Glad to hear it.   
I'm always here for you.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Thank you so much. Really.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - ......   
Happy - ...I know.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh, I almost forgot!   
Happy - There's something I wanted to give you.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um...   
Here it is.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Since you're always listening to music, I thought you might like these.   
And I think you were a fan of this design, so I tried to match it...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
DEV: *Unused message labels.    
*If this appears, it is a bug.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - This is from my heart...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Remember how I told you that I was pretty good with machines?   
Happy - Well, I wanted you to see that side of me instead of my cooking side.   
Happy - I just want you to know everything about me.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I replaced my old headphones   
with the ones Fuuka gave me.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
!!   
The sound quality is unbelievably clear!   
Her technical skills must be next-level.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
So... what do you think?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I love them!   
Your skills are impressive.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Really? Oh, I'm so happy!   
Happy - Whenever you listen to them, it'll be like I'm there with you. No matter where we might be...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Fuuka is gazing intently at me...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, it's nothing really. Just a hobby.   
Happy - But I'm really glad you like them.   
Happy - Whenever you listen, it'll be like I'm there with you. No matter where we might be...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Fuuka is gazing intently at me...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel a strong bond with Fuuka...

The High Priestess Social Link reached its maximum level! You can now fuse **Scathach**, the instructor!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
...Oh, sorry.   
I was having so much fun, I didn't mean to keep you for so long.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Ah! I didn't realize it was so late.   
......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Um...   
Sad - We still have time, right?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Just a little longer...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Please... stay with me.   
Happy - ......   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I spent a long time with Fuuka.

Fuuka Yamagishi   
So... Um...   
Please don't laugh at this, okay?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The other day, I let Yukari-chan try a new dish I made.   
She liked it so much, she ended up eating it all.   
So I told her it was meant to return the favor for what everyone's done for me.   
But she got really confused and asked me what favor this was about.   
It didn't seem like she had any idea what I was talking about, so I told her the whole story.   
And when I finished... she burst out laughing.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
She told me I didn't need to do anything like that.   
She said, "When you're friends, you don't keep score."   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
She's right.   
Ahaha! That's funny.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - Hey. I asked you not to laugh...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Honestly...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I had been so negative this whole time.   
Sad - I felt like I needed to be useful to belong here.   
Sad - Even though that wasn't true at all. It was just what I was telling myself.   
Sad - I was being blinded by my fear.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
But understanding this made me realize what I really wanted to do.   
I've been going on about wanting to repay everyone for what they've done for me, but...   
The real reason is a lot more simple.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - So, um... will you... hear me out?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Normally, I'd ask your opinion on how best to do something like this, but...   
Sad - ......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I...   
I want you by my side, Arisato-kun.   
I want to be together with you, forever.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I feel the same way.   
Me too.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Um...   
Sad - ...I-I hope you understood what I meant just now.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I better choose my words carefully here...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I better choose my words carefully here...   
Come to think of it, **I have a special**   
**relationship with another person already**...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - ......   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I love you, Fuuka.   
We'll always be friends.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - ...!?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
We'll be together forever.   
I'll treat you right.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Yes...!   
Happy - No matter what happens, I'll be by your side.   
Happy - As long as I have you, Arisato-kun, I feel like I can handle anything.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Thank you...   
Happy - ......   
Happy - ...Sorry, I don't know what to say.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um...   
......   
Happy - ...I love you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Fuuka expressed her feelings for me.   
I have entered a special   
relationship with Fuuka...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It's the chime signaling the   
end of the school day...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, the time...   
......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Do you think... maybe we could keep talking for a little longer?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I talked with Fuuka for a long time...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - ......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Thank you...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You know, as long as I'm with you, and everyone else at the dorm...   
Then I feel like I'll be okay, no matter what happens. I know our bonds can't be torn apart.   
I wouldn't have been able to think like this if you hadn't been there to help me with my terrible cooking, Arisato-kun.   
Happy - So thank you... for everything.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I won't dwell on having to repay everyone anymore.   
Happy - But, I think I'm going to stick with cooking for a bit longer.   
And this time not to maintain my relationship with anyone... but because I want to do it for myself.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I can sense Fuuka's determination.   
It seems we've grown closer...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
So, if it's all right with you, Arisato-kun...   
Do you think you could still help me with my cooking sometime?   
I know it might not always go well, and sometimes it might feel like I'm imposing on you...   
Happy - But... I think it'd be fun to cook with friends.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure.   
I'm not confident.   
What are you gonna make?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Yes! Thank you, Arisato-kun.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I figured it would be best to choose something that's fun to do with others.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Well, I think it'll be okay, since we're doing it as a team.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, but...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Do you think I could leave the seasoning to you?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hmm, what would be good...?   
I'm thinking I should try something people don't usually cook every day.   
Maybe Japanese cuisine? Or French?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Hehe, I can't wait.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh! I need to get going.   
I have to go shopping for cookbooks. Let me know if you think of anything too, okay?   
Happy - I'll see you later.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I said goodbye to Fuuka, then   
returned to the dorm...

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Hmmmm...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - There weren't really that many cookbooks, were there...?   
Sad - I'm sorry. I didn't realize that store mainly sold manga.   
Sad - I should've looked the place up beforehand.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - ......   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What is it?   
Something wrong with that?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Oh, um...   
Do you mind if we take a seat?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Do you remember what I told you before?   
Sad - I mentioned that I don't really like going to bookstores.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, I remember.   
But we were just in one...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Well, about that...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I had a bit of a bad experience in a bookstore once.   
Sad - I think it was at the start of last April.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Someone took a picture of me.   
Sad - They accused me of "stealing."   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I'm not very tall, right?   
Sad - So when I was reaching for a high shelf, I accidentally knocked some books down...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Well, a few of them landed in my bag. I went to take them out and put them back on the shelf, but...   
Sad - Some girl from my class took a picture of me with her cell phone.   
Sad - She even threatened to show my parents...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You did nothing wrong.   
......   
That's messed up.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Right? I bet you think I'm stupid for letting this get to me.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I bet you think I'm stupid for letting it get to me.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - ...Thank you, Arisato-kun.   
Sad - But don't you think I'm stupid for letting this get to me?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - If I'd just spoken up, I could've settled it right there.   
Sad - ...I know that.   
Sad - But I... I still couldn't say anything back.   
Sad - All these negative thoughts kept running through my head.   
Sad - I thought no matter what I said, it wouldn't do any good in the end.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - But now... I want to believe that I can change.   
Sad - Whenever I'm with you, Arisato-kun, I feel like I don't get swept up in those negative thoughts.   
I know I'm being selfish. But...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - I-I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm saying.   
Surprised - I'm making it sound like I'm just using you, aren't I?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - That's not what I meant, really!   
What I'm trying to say is...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I've really come to depend on you, Arisato-kun.   
And I'm really happy that you're there for me. That's all.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Fuuka expressed how she feels about me.   
My relationship with her is   
becoming more intimate...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Oh, um, sorry. I'm always going on about my own problems.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
At this rate, I'm never going to be able to repay you.   
I should've just discussed my cooking concerns with everyone at the dorm, but...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Somehow, I find myself always going to you for help, Arisato-kun.   
I want to hear your opinion, but more than that, I feel at ease when you're with me.   
Sad - I wonder why...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I'm sure it's because you're our leader. That's why I depend on you so much.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Is that the only reason?   
That's probably it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Huh?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
O-Oh. Well, maybe that isn't the only reason...   
......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Sorry, um... I think I need to go back to the dorm.   
Sad - I need some time to get my thoughts in order.   
Sad - Could we talk about this again later?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Thank you. I'm going to head back now.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - You think so too?   
I tend to complicate things in my head by overthinking it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - But I'll make sure to return the favor for everything you've done for me!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Well, I'll see you back at the dorm.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Fuuka left.   
I decided to return to the dorm...

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Sorry for taking so long.   
Sad - I wanted to buy something to use as a secret ingredient in my cooking.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - But I couldn't really decide, and I wasn't sure how to use whatever I'd buy...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Do you really need one?   
Start with the basics first.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
...Oh, good point. I felt like I had to add something, but maybe I actually don't.   
Happy - I'll think about this again once I've gotten the basics down.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
...Yes, you're right.   
I haven't even gotten the basics down yet. I'm getting way too ahead of myself.   
Happy - First thing I need to do is find something that I can actually make.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm still having a lot of trouble getting things right.   
Happy - But I can't give up yet. Not after all your support, Arisato-kun.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - And it's not like I have any other redeeming qualities.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
There's nothing you're good at?   
What about your Persona?   
You're a hard worker.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Something I'm good at?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - Hmm, let me think...   
Exasperated* - Well, I guess I'm a little handy with machines.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh, I just meant more that I like them. It's nothing really worth boasting about.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I guess that's true, but...   
Everyone else has some other thing that they're really good at too.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Except for me...   
Sad - I guess I'm sort of good with machines, but that's it, really.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, um... I just meant that I like them.   
It's not really something to be proud of.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
N-No, that's not true at all.   
I mean, everyone in our group works hard.   
And beyond that, I think you all have something that you're good at.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Not me.   
Sad - I mean, I guess I'm sort of good with machines, but that's it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - I-It's honestly not worth mentioning. Really!   
I just happen to like them. It's not exactly something worth boasting about.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
When I was little, I remember my dad's hobby was to work on complicated sound equipment.   
He'd fix things like broken amplifiers, or headphones that only played sound on one side.   
I've always loved watching him work on those things.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
That's probably why I was drawn to working with machines in the first place.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
But, I don't think that would be very useful to repay everyone's kindness.   
Plus, if we do ever have any technical needs, like when we're fighting, then we've always got the Kirijo Group's support.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Not to mention that I'm kind of embarrassed about it all. I mean, it's not a very feminine hobby.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's not true.   
Maybe you're right.   
Why do you think that?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Arisato-kun...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Thank you.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
See? You think so, too.   
Looking away - ...Well, I guess that's just the way I am.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Why...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - Huh. I don't know. Maybe because it was originally my dad's hobby?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I sure seem to talk about my problems a lot, huh?   
I wonder why it's so easy talking to you, Arisato-kun.   
I feel like you stop me from being so negative all the time.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Actually, I might owe a lot to you in that sense.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I think Fuuka trusts me now.   
It seems we've grown closer...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, it's getting late. Sorry, I didn't mean to talk so much.   
Let's go home.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Fuuka and I went back   
to the dorm together...

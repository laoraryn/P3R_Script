Fuuka Yamagishi
Wow, there are so many choices. What do I pick...?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Hm?
The special ramen bowl and... an extra large side of rice?
I am curious about that one, but it sounds like a lot of food.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Probably.
You'd better not order that.
I'll eat your ramen for you.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Hmm, what to do...?
I've heard you can eat more if you reduce the number of times that you chew.
But then, I don't think you'd be able to really taste the food if you ate that way.

Fuuka Yamagishi
You're probably right.
Maybe if I was absolutely starving, I could handle that...
But I had lunch today, so I'm not quite that hungry.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Huh? You'd offer to eat that?
Happy - Then the only thing I'd have is the big bowl of rice!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Hmm...

Fuuka Yamagishi
I think I'll just go with a regular set meal. Okay, I'm ready to order.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Our orders are ready.
The deep, rich flavor of the
broth fills me to my core.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - That was really good! It had a strong flavor, but went down so smoothly!
Happy - Food from a restaurant always tastes so amazing.

Fuuka Yamagishi
You know, before I moved into the dorm, I'd never really eaten out that much.
My parents always said that eating at home would give me more time to study.
And whenever we ate, that's all we'd talk about. My upcoming tests, my post-graduation plans...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sounds suffocating.
They're big on education, huh?

Fuuka Yamagishi
...Yes. I suppose it was.
Thinking back now, I don't even really remember the taste of my mom's cooking.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Mhm.
They even factored that into my diet. They said certain foods would boost my focus.
I don't really remember how any of it tasted though. I was always too high-strung to notice.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - I... I really didn't want to disappoint my family.
That's why I tried so hard to meet their expectations.
Sad - But all they ever said to me was, "Try harder."
Sad - I was never good enough for them.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - And I think that's a big reason why I never had any confidence in myself.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Fuuka opened up about her
family situation to me.
It seems we've grown closer...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, you know, the gyoza here was really good too, wasn't it?
Happy - Lightly crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside... I'd like to try making some myself one day.
Happy - Plus, I bet it would be fun to make it together with someone...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, but I'm not quite ready for that yet. I'd probably make so many mistakes.

Minato Arisato - Selection
I think it'd be fine.
You're worrying too much.

Fuuka Yamagishi
You think so?

Fuuka Yamagishi
But if it doesn't come out well, wouldn't I just be wasting everyone's time?
I'm a little afraid that it might turn out like that, actually...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh. Say, Arisato-kun, could I ask you for one more favor?
I'm thinking I'll take this opportunity to study how to make gyoza like the ones here.
Happy - Just so I have more options when cooking for everyone.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Fuuka and I ate gyoza and
discussed how to make them.
It's about time to head back to the dorm...

Sorry, I know you probably aren't very hungry at this hour.   
But, um, I'd be happy if you'd maybe give it a taste, if that's okay.

......   
The bento box looks like a   
chaotic mess of ingredients.   
It seems I have no choice but to eat it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I used vinegar as a base for relieving fatigue, and then added a bunch of citrus.   
You know, just some simple, light flavors.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It has a very... impactful flavor.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I want your honest opinion, okay? H-How was it?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
......   
It tastes horrible.   
Not bad for a beginner.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Er, um...   
Sad - I guess that means... not good?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Ngh. I thought you might say that...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - ......   
Th-Thank you though. For being honest.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
R-Really?   
Happy - Please, let me know if there's anything I can improve on.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Actually, you don't look so well, Arisato-kun...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh no, what do I do!?   
Surprised - Um, I'll go get some water. Wait right here!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I'm sorry I made you taste test my cooking.   
Sad - I just figured that I could count on you for an honest opinion.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Well... Thank you for your time today.   
I'm going to keep at it. I should focus on making it edible first though...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel like I've gotten a little closer to Fuuka.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I'll see you back at the dorm.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I decided to go back to the dorm too...

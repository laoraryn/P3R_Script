Oh, Arisato-kun. Are you going home?
Sad - You look a bit pale... Are you doing all right?
Sad - Don't overwork yourself, okay? Maybe you should rest in the nurse's office before you leave.
I was actually about to head to the faculty office. Would you like me to walk you downstairs?

Fuuka Yamagishi - MSG_001_0_0
Happy - I... want to spend as much time with you as I can...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's do it.
I'm a little busy today...

Fuuka Yamagishi - MSG_003_0_0
Happy - I'd be happy to.
Okay, let's head down to the faculty office together.
Oh...
Happy - It'll be kind of embarrassing to walk side by side at school, huh?

Fuuka Yamagishi - MSG_004_0_0
Sad - Oh... Well, be careful on your way home, okay?

-

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's do it.
I'm a little busy today...

Fuuka Yamagishi - MSG_006_0_0
Sounds good. People often get sick when the seasons change, so maybe you're coming down with something.
Happy - Okay, let's head over to the faculty office together.

Fuuka Yamagishi - MSG_007_0_0
Sad - Do you have plans already? Well, just make sure you go home soon and get some rest.

Mr. Ekoda
Hmm? Yamagishi, what are you doing outside the faculty office?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Oh, well... I-I want to start a tech club!

Mr. Ekoda
Tech gloves?
...Are you referring to technician's gloves?
I think you'd have to go to a hardware store for those.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Um, not "tech gloves"... A tech club!
Like a club all about technology and electronics!

Mr. Ekoda
You want to start a club now?
...Why is it always you, Yamagishi?
Look, it's already March. Can't you at least wait until April?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Huh? B-But I really want to get this group going!
I promise I'll do my best to find members and all that... So, do I have your permission to start the club?

Mr. Ekoda
What? You don't even have any members yet? Then it's not even worth discussing.
You can't start a club without at least five members.
Now, I must be going.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - And he's gone...
Sad - Well, it looks like I need to find five people now.

Fuuka Yamagishi
...Arisato-kun, would you like to join my tech club?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Of course.
...I'll think about it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Yesss! I'm so happy to hear that!
Happy - I was hoping you'd help me.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Exasperated* - Oh... Well, I think it'd be a lot of fun to have a tech club.
But I guess I do tend to drag you into things only I'm interested in...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - ......
Sad - You know... I used to think it was wrong for me to like electronics.
Sad - I always kept it to myself, because I thought it was a strange thing for a girl to be interested in.

-

Fuuka Yamagishi
But you accepted me for who I am, Arisato-kun.
That's why I decided to be strong and let everyone know who I really am.
Even if people think I'm strange, I know it's okay.
I have you with me, so there's nothing to be scared of.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Now I want to meet more people like me and hang out with them.
Since I kept my love of electronics hidden, I never had any friends who shared my interests.
That's why I thought I'd try starting a club all about it.
Because maybe there are other people out there who like this stuff too. And if so, I want a way to talk to them.
I do admit I'm a little nervous though...

Fuuka Yamagishi
But don't worry! I'll still keep going to art club.
It'll probably get really busy... but I want to keep trying.
Happy - It's like... jumping off the diving board at the pool. That kind of feeling.

Fuuka Yamagishi
......
You'll stay in art club next year too, won't you, Arisato-kun?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'd like to.
Not sure.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - ...That's good.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Oh... Really?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Next year, I want to be in whatever clubs you're in.
I'd like to be in the same homeroom, too...
And I'd love to see you more at the dorm...
I think I just want to be with you more in general...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - I keep asking "more" of you, don't I...?
Sad - ...If there's anything I can do for you, don't hesitate to ask.
Sad - I know I'm not the most reliable...
But I want to get to know you better.
I want to be closer to you...
......

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Oh! I-I've got to hurry and find some club members! And I need to make recruitment posters too...
Happy - W-Well, I'll see you later!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Next time... maybe we can talk about it more in my room...?
......
Happy - Now I really have to go now! Bye!

-

Fuuka Yamagishi
But you and the team accepted me for who I am, Arisato-kun.
That's why I decided to be strong and let everyone see my true self.
So even if people think I'm strange, I know it's okay.
I don't want to hide it anymore.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Now I want to meet more people like me and hang out with them.
Since I kept my love of electronics hidden, I never had any friends who shared my interests.
That's why I thought I'd try starting a club all about it.
Because maybe there are other people out there who like this stuff too. And if so, I want a way to talk to them.
I do admit I'm a little nervous though...

Fuuka Yamagishi

It'll probably get really busy... but I want to keep trying.
It's like... jumping off the diving board at the pool. That kind of feeling.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - ...Anyways, I've got to find some club members!
Hmm... Do I need to make recruitment posters and stuff?

Minato Arisato - Selection
You've got this.
Need some help?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Yes, thank you.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Thank you, but... I'm going to try this on my own first.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - ...To be honest, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried.
Sad - We're going to be third-years soon.
Sad - And that means everyone'll have to start thinking about what they want to do after we graduate.
Sad - In fact, Iori-kun and Yukari-chan were talking about college entrance exams just the other day...

Fuuka Yamagishi
But you know what? I think I'll be okay.
I have everyone here to support me, so there's nothing to be afraid of.
......
Sad - ...Everyone?
Sad - I keep saying it, but who am I talking about...?
...Um, sorry. Don't mind me.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Oh, I didn't realize it was so late! I hope the stores are still open...
Let's see, I need paper... Oh, and I need to find a clubroom too...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I think this might be more work than I thought!
Sorry, Arisato-kun. I need to get going.
I'll see you later!

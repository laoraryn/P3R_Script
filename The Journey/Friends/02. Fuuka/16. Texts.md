Hello   
   
Sorry about what happened the other day. But I've been practicing my cooking, and I want you to see how much I've improved!    
I'm a little nervous about going into your classroom, so I'll wait for you in the hallway on the second floor.   
   
-----   
   
If you don't mind...   
   
Would you like to go home together?   
I'll be waiting in the second-floor hallway. I'd love to chat with you on the way back.    
   
-----   
   
I have a favor to ask...   
   
Could you come with me to Paulownia Mall on the way home? Going there alone makes me feel a little nervous. *sweatdrop*   
   
-----   
   
Do you have time?   
   
I've been thinking a lot about what we talked about last time.   
If you have some time, I'd like for you to see my progress.   
Hope you're feeling hungry!

Sorry, I know this is kind of sudden, but I'd like to ask for your help with something. Can we meet up?

After school   
   
Have you been to the used bookstore at the strip mall? I've been wanting to check it out, and it'd make me really happy if you came along, too.    
You can find me in the second-floor hallway if you'd like to join me.

At the rooftop   
   
Do you have some time today? I kind of want to talk to you.   
It's nothing particularly important, though.   
I'm just really grateful that you're always there for me.

Arisato-kun, do you have time after school?   
I'd like to talk with you alone. I think I'm finally ready to tell you how I feel.   
   
-----   
   
Let's go home together?   
   
Shall we?    
I was actually thinking of taking a break from practicing cooking today.   
   
-----   
   
For reference!   
   
I have a favor to ask you.   
Do you have some time after school today? There's somewhere I'd like to go.    
   
-----   
   
Urgent!   
   
There's something I really want to tell you right now.   
Oh, but it's nothing that serious. I just wanted to chat, like how we always do. :)   
   
-----   
   
Are you hungry?   
   
Remember what we talked about the other day? I'm thinking of doing that today.   
Are you okay with that?    
   
-----   
   
Hello   
   
If you don't mind, could we meet after school?   
   
-----   
   
Let's chat   
   
If you're not too busy, can we talk for a bit?    
   
-----   
   
Hello   
   
What are you up to, Arisato-kun? Do you have a minute? :)   
   
-----   
   
If you don't mind...   
   
Sorry, I know this is kind of out of the blue. *sweatdrop*   
But if you don't have any plans, shall we go somewhere together?   
   
-----   
   
Movie!    
   
There's a movie I'm interested in. It's a sci-fi movie that takes place in a realistic setting...   
It seems to be a fan favorite, so maybe you'll learn what makes it so charming!   
If you're interested, would you like to watch it together? :)

Summer festival    
   
There's going to be a festival at Naganaki Shrine tonight. I'd love to check it out. Would you like to come with me?   
   
-----   
   
Christmas    
   
I've been thinking... I'd really love to spend Christmas together with you. :)   
How about you? I'll be waiting for your reply.

About Amada-kun   
   
I'm a little concerned about Amada-kun.   
Ever since second semester started, he's been looking kind of down.   
He won't tell me anything, so I was hoping you'd drop by his room and check in on him. Could you?   
   
-----   
   
About Amada-kun   
   
How was Amada-kun?   
Maybe I'm just overthinking it, but it wouldn't hurt to talk to him.   
Could you drop by his room and check in on him?   
   
-----   
   
I'm on the 2nd floor.   
   
I'll be at the couch on the second floor today. If you'd like to go to Tartarus, please look for me there.   
   
-----   
   
I'm on the 3rd floor.   
   
I'll be on the third floor today. If you'd like to go to Tartarus, please look for me there.   
   
-----   
   
I'm in the command room.   
   
I'll be inside the command room today. If you'd like to go to Tartarus, please look for me there.

About Koro-chan   
   
When Koro-chan sits outside the dorm, he kind of looks like a guardian angel.   
I wonder if he gets cold though...   
I'm a little worried he'll get sick, so please check on him whenever you see him at the front entrance, okay?

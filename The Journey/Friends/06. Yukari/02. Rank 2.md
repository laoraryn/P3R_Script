Yukari Takeba
Hmm... Lilies are too fragrant, and roses aren't really my thing...
Happy - Maybe gerberas...?

Yukari Takeba
Oh, sorry!
I'm redecorating my room, and was thinking of getting some flowers to go with it.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I think I'll go with the gerberas. What color do you think should I get?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Cute pink.
Pure white.
Bright red.
What's a gerbera?

Yukari Takeba
Happy - You think so? I like pink too!
Happy - I guess we have the same taste, huh...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Then it's decided! I'll get these.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - White? Isn't that kinda boring?

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Bright red? Wouldn't that stand out too much?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Are you serious?
Sad - Come on, you should know this kind of stuff.

Yukari Takeba
Hmm... Come to think of it, gerberas by themselves might be a little plain...

Yukari Takeba
What other flowers do you think would look nice?
Exasperated* - Oh wait, you've never seen my room, have you? Well then, why am I even asking you?

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's mean.
Invite me over, then.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Hehe... But it's the truth!

Yukari Takeba
You wish! I'm not falling for that trick.
Happy - Haha, you're as bad as Junpei.

Yukari Takeba
To be honest, any flowers would be fine if they were from you, Arisato-kun.
Very happy* - ...Just kidding! Ahaha.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari seems to be full of laughter today.
It seems we've grown closer...

Yukari Takeba
Wow, look at the time.

Yukari Takeba
Gosh, what should I get...? I'm actually a pretty indecisive person.
Hmmm... A ranunculus wouldn't be bad either...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After hanging out with Yukari,
I decided to return to the dorm...

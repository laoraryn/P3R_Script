Yukari Takeba
Oh, hi. What're you doing?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Nothing.
Just looking around.
Not much. How about you?

Yukari Takeba
Oh. Okay.

Yukari Takeba
Well, there's not much to see...

Yukari Takeba
Um, just killing time, I guess.

Yukari Takeba
Well, you're probably pretty tired after your first day, huh? Maybe you should go to bed early.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - The chairman's a nice guy, but his sense of humor can take some getting used to...

Yukari Takeba
I guess there was a dorm mother here once who cooked and stuff, but it's just us students now.
Maybe that's why we have such a nice kitchen. It seems like a waste not to use it...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, it does.
That's a bit much.

Yukari Takeba
Yeah... I don't know that I'd really be able to make good use of it, though.
And Kirijo-senpai doesn't do stuff like cooking. But I would feel kinda bad if no one ever used it...

Yukari Takeba
Hm. I guess you don't really care about stuff like that, huh? Okay.

Yukari Takeba
The more I think about it, the more I wanna try using the kitchen sometime... I guess we'll see.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Kirijo-senpai said she'll be late today. I guess she's processing some paperwork for you.
Sad - Hey... Try not to overdo it at school tomorrow, okay?

Yukari Takeba
C'mon, they're waiting for you inside.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Tartarus just drains me for some reason.
Sad - You know how the air is thin at the top of a mountain? It kinda feels like that.
What about you, Arisato-kun?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, it's tiring.
It's not so bad.

Yukari Takeba
You too, huh? I guess we'll just have to slowly get used to it.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Oh, is that so? Haha, I guess you're tougher than you look.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Tartarus seems like it's gonna be pretty tough for a lot of reasons, but let's do our best.

Yukari Takeba
It's good to use a weapon you're comfortable with. Like for me, I use a bow.
I'm on the archery team at school, so I'm pretty used to how it feels.
I'm not an expert or anything, though, so I do miss sometimes...
Happy - But it's not like I miss that often, so I can't sweat the small stuff, right?

Yukari Takeba
Kirijo-senpai is so stoic, isn't she?
Well, she has a lot of responsibilities, so maybe it kinda comes with the territory.

Yukari Takeba
Kirijo-senpai should be in the command room. She said she was gonna do some training.
Happy - Oh, but she also said we can still go to Tartarus tonight, if you want to.

Yukari Takeba
Hey, Arisato-kun, have you picked up any supplies, like medicine and stuff?
Happy - You probably know this, but I'll tell you just in case: shops aren't open during the Dark Hour.
So you should get whatever you might need before the Dark Hour.
We don't want someone to get injured in Tartarus and not be able to do anything about it, y'know?

Yukari Takeba
I don't think I really have time for student council.
I'm busy enough with archery, studying, and fighting Shadows. It's already kind of a lot.
Sad - And, I mean, Kirijo-senpai is just...
Surprised - Actually, it's nothing. Never mind.

Yukari Takeba
I'm so glad we can start using the Internet again.
I've been meaning to check out the new summer clothes that are coming out now.
I guess I could look at magazines, but it's quicker to just check online. Plus, it's free.

Yukari Takeba
I can't believe it's already the last day of April.
It was probably one of the hardest months of my life, honestly...
I hope I can relax a little next month...

Yukari Takeba
Who was that guy in Sanada-senpai's hospital room? You think it was a friend of his?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, it seemed like it.
They didn't seem like friends.
You shouldn't pry.

Yukari Takeba
I guess he did say he was "a friend from school"...
But I don't think I've seen him at school before, so I don't know.

Yukari Takeba
I wonder what the deal is, then...
Sanada-senpai said that guy goes to our school, but I've never seen him there, so it's kinda weird.

Yukari Takeba
Yeah, I guess you're right. It's none of my business.

Yukari Takeba
I can't help but wonder who he is. It's just... Agh, sorry, I shouldn't be so obsessed with this.

Yukari Takeba
Let's try to have some fun during Golden Week.
Sad - Especially since we'll be busy studying for midterms right after it...

Yukari Takeba
Arisato-kun, have you been studying for the midterms?
You might wanna start now, if you haven't, since we'll also be busy with Tartarus.
I mean, it's not like we can tell people that we were too busy fighting Shadows to study.

Yukari Takeba
I know Apathy Syndrome isn't exactly natural, but even then, something seems off about it.
Maybe I'm just being pessimistic, but I find I'm usually right about the bad stuff...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I can't believe I'm still alive...
Sad - If you weren't there, I'd definitely be dead...
So... thanks.

Yukari Takeba
The people on the monorail must've been pretty freaked out...
It was so far off course after the Dark Hour ended.
Actually, "freaked out" probably doesn't even begin to describe it.

Yukari Takeba
Sounds like something in the command room is having issues.
Kirijo-senpai was asking earlier if anyone could take a look at it.
Surprised - I can't do it, though! I don't have a clue when it comes to stuff like that.

Yukari Takeba
I guess it's true that missing one day of studying probably won't change our results that much.
Exasperated* - Ugh, am I really agreeing with Junpei's logic? Maybe I really do need a break...

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Junpei's acting stupid again. He doesn't care who joins us, as long as she's a girl. Ugh...

Minato Arisato - Selection
But more girl power's good.
Yeah, he's too excited.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Well, yeah. Junpei aside, it would be nice to have another girl with us.

Yukari Takeba
Right? I mean, the look on his face when he heard about her...
Well, I guess I shouldn't be upset with someone for being happy, but... we know his reasons.

Yukari Takeba
Our exam results come out tomorrow, huh?
I don't think I flunked it or anything, but...
I couldn't really study like I usually do because of Tartarus and everything.
Hm... I probably shouldn't make excuses. I'll just have to plan better for the next exams.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - My results were actually better than I expected!
Happy - It seemed like the exams didn't cover that much this time, so I kinda lucked out.
I do still wish that I had enough energy to study after going to Tartarus, though.

Yukari Takeba
It's too bad about that girl, Fuuka Yamagishi, huh?
Sad - It would've been nice if a girl the same year as me joined...

Yukari Takeba
Thinking about how many more victims there'd be if we couldn't fight Shadows is pretty depressing...
I'm glad you moved here, Arisato-kun. It's a lot less overwhelming with you here.
There's no telling when all this will end, but together, I know we can do it eventually.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - God, I hate bullying. Even just seeing it happen to someone else, it feels just as bad...

Minato Arisato - Selection
I feel the same.
I'd just ignore it.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Right? I overheard these girls today talking about how they were picking on someone...
I couldn't tell who they were talking about or anything, though. I wish I could do something...

Yukari Takeba
You should be careful about that.
Sad - Sometimes, turning a blind eye to that kind of thing can be just as bad as the bullying itself...

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Oh my god, Stupei, shut up! Now I'm never gonna get to sleep tonight...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Well, guess I should take responsibility and come by your room tonight to check on you and—


Yukari Takeba
Surprised - "And" what exactly?
Angry - Do I need to call the police? Or, better yet, Kirijo-senpai?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Wait, wait! I was gonna say, "and sing you a lullaby"! It was just a joke!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - The girl they found was one of those girls I overheard talking about bullying someone...
Sad - It's probably unrelated, though... Right, Arisato-kun?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, probably.
They could be connected.
Let's ask the Ace Detective.

Yukari Takeba
Yeah... I'm sure I'm just thinking about it too much.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Maybe... Honestly, something about it is bothering me too...

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - What...? Oh, you're talking about Junpei? *sigh*
Angry - Seriously, he's such an idiot.

Yukari Takeba
I'm trying to find stuff online about that ghost story. It seems like it could take a while, though...
So I'm not gonna go to Tartarus today. Sorry.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Ugh... What did I get myself into...?
Angry - Actually, I didn't get myself into anything! This is all Junpei's fault!
Angry - Stupei and his stupid "Believe It, or Don't"... Gah!

Yukari Takeba
Hey, did you do any research on that ghost story, Arisato-kun?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I sure did.
No, I didn't.

Yukari Takeba
I knew I could count on you. But, man, there sure are a bunch of different stories floating around.
Exasperated* - I can't tell which are real and which are fake... Maybe they're all fake...

Yukari Takeba
Yeah, I honestly kinda figured you'd be too busy to bother with ghost stories.

Yukari Takeba
I'm not totally sure how to figure out which stories are true and which aren't...
But one thing I am sure of is that ghosts don't exist, and I'm gonna prove it.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - All right, enough's enough.
Angry - Tomorrow, I'm going to put an end to Junpei's stupid "Believe It, or Don't."
Angry - You're not too freaked out about all this, right, Arisato-kun?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm a little freaked out.
Junpei's the freaked out one.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Good! I knew I could count on you.

Yukari Takeba
Come on, you know ghosts aren't even real, don't you?

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Yeah, he's always freaked out. Don't worry about it.

Yukari Takeba
That guy looked kinda scary, but he was actually really nice, don'tcha think?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, I agree.
You think so?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Well, you can't judge a book by its cover and all that. But what was he doing at that place...?

Yukari Takeba
I mean, he wouldn't have saved us if he wasn't a nice guy, right?
Sad - At the very least, I don't think he's a bad person... So why's he seem like he's trying to act like he is?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I bet Kirijo-senpai and Sanada-senpai are trying to convince Yamagishi-san to join our team.
Sad - That worries me...

Yukari Takeba

Yukari Takeba

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I hope Kirijo-senpai and Sanada-senpai aren't pressuring her to join us if she doesn't want to.
Sometimes, it feels like they'd do anything to achieve our goal, you know?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I know she technically made the decision on her own, but...
Sad - It didn't seem like Yamagishi-san was really given much of a choice to me.
Sad - *sigh* I don't like this...

Yukari Takeba
The room must be covered in dust since no one's used it before.
Sad - Please don't let there be any cockroaches...

Yukari Takeba
I guess all that talk about Fuuka being sick wasn't true.
At first, people were saying that she was absent because she was being bullied...
But then they started saying she was really sick.
Happy - Strange, huh? She seems pretty healthy to me.

Yukari Takeba
Kirijo-senpai was doing support, and now she'll be fighting with us.
Most of us can only do one or the other, but she can do both...
Sad - She really can do anything, huh...?

Yukari Takeba
I kept thinking about how Kirijo-senpai dragged Fuuka into this...
But Fuuka really seems determined to do her best, so I guess there's no point dwelling on it.
Happy - Instead, I'll just focus on doing my best too!

Yukari Takeba
Everything about Tartarus is such a mystery...
How long has it been there? Why did it appear in the first place?
Sad - Do you think we'll ever know the answers...?

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Koromaru's so cute, and he's such a loyal dog.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I wish we could take Koro-chan in and look after him here.
Happy - Sanada-senpai could be in charge of walking him, since he goes jogging quite often anyway.

Yukari Takeba
Yeah, I can totally see them running along a river together or something.
Happy - Buuut I kinda doubt that we'd be allowed to keep animals in the dorm.

Yukari Takeba
Our Personas' abilities are amazing, aren't they?
Happy - Secret powers that only we have... It's actually pretty cool, huh?
Happy - It's kind of a shame we can't tell anyone about them.

Yukari Takeba
I can't really blame Ikutsuki-san for trying to brighten up the mood...
Exasperated* - But his jokes are just so lame...

Yukari Takeba
I heard that a lot of the people joining the Lost lately are couples.
I'll try not to assume what they were doing together just before the Dark Hour...
Sad - But anyway, it seems like the next Shadow is starting to make its move, doesn't it...?

Yukari Takeba
Hey, Arisato-kun, do you usually have plans on your days off?
There's this interesting kid who hangs out at the shrine, so I've been talking to him there lately.
Happy - I'm planning to go see him again tomorrow. If you're free, you should come meet him!

Yukari Takeba
I kinda get the feeling that the next Shadow is making its move already.
I should probably start getting ready...
Happy - Maybe I'll shop for some supplies after the shrine tomorrow.

Yukari Takeba
I wonder what's at the top of Tartarus...

Fuuka Yamagishi
If this was an adventure novel, there'd probably be some kind of treasure...

Junpei Iori
Happy - I got it! There's a giant piñata! And when you break it...
Happy - Candy pours out, and a huge banner that says, "Congratulations! You've beaten Tartarus!"

Yukari Takeba
Yeah, I'm sure that's it.
Maybe there's, like, some sort of device, and once we destroy it, Tartarus will disappear...

Yukari Takeba
O-Oh, hey. Um, we're just talking about girl stuff, so...
Hm? What's with that look?

Minato Arisato - Selection
You're acting suspiciously...
It's nothing, I trust you.
Can I join in?

Yukari Takeba
What's so suspicious? Seriously, it's just girl talk.
Happy - Right, Fuuka?

Yukari Takeba
Happy - You better, haha! But seriously, though, we're just talking.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Wh-What!? But it's girl talk!
Exasperated* - So... no boys allowed. Maybe later, okay? Just not right now.

Yukari Takeba
There's still so much we don't know about Tartarus and Shadows...
But at least we know when the next operation day will be, so we can prepare for it.
So how well do you usually prepare anyway, Arisato-kun?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I prepare thoroughly.
I prepare well.
I don't prepare.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Really? I'm impressed! No wonder you're our leader.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Oh, good. I'm glad to hear that. Well, let's keep at it then, okay?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Seriously? Is that really a good idea? I feel like the leader should be at least a little prepared...

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - I guess I should start getting ready myself too. We've got less than a week to go, don't we?

Yukari Takeba
Kirijo-senpai never tells us more than what she thinks we need to know...

Minato Arisato - Selection
I noticed that too.
That's just how she is.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Yeah... It's hard for us to know what's going on when she makes all the decisions herself.
Sad - And that kind of behavior can lead to misunderstandings...

Yukari Takeba
Yeah, I guess telling everyone everything isn't really her style, but...
Sad - Well, I dunno...

Yukari Takeba
Sorry. I didn't mean to complain.
Happy - Maybe I'll go chat with Amada-kun tomorrow. That usually brightens up my day a little.

Yukari Takeba
Only a few more days until the next operation. I'm starting to get a little nervous...
Happy - Maybe I'll feel a little better if I go visit the shrine tomorrow. Oh, did I tell you?
Happy - I met this kid there and we've been chatting once in a while. He says I'm "very helpful." Haha!
Happy - If you're free, you should come join us too, Arisato-kun.

Yukari Takeba
I wonder what the next Shadow will be like. I bet it'll be stronger than the other ones so far...

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Oh, I almost forgot! I wanted to apologize for hitting you yesterday.
Sad - I kept meaning to say something earlier, but I didn't want everyone else to hear...
So, um... yeah. I'm sorry.

Yukari Takeba
Kirijo-senpai takes her "mission" really seriously.
She would probably do just about anything to annihilate the Shadows.
Sad - I can respect feeling like there's something you have to do, but... isn't it a bit much sometimes?

Fuuka Yamagishi
I think I know what you mean.
There are a lot of old sayings about maintaining balance in your life...
I understand not wanting to be too laid-back, but you shouldn't become obsessive either.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Amada-kun is so mature. I can't believe he's only in elementary school.
There's a certain someone who I wish would learn from Amada-kun's example.
Why do you think he's so childish all the time? Even an actual child acts more grown-up...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Hmm...
It's not like I don't like Yakushima or anything.
I usually love the ocean and getting some sun. And I don't get seasick, so the trip's not an issue.
Sad - I just... I guess I'm just not really in the mood for it right now...

Yukari Takeba
She looks like a normal girl as long as she doesn't do anything too weird. But if she does...
Do you think anyone will figure out that she's actually a robot?
Well, maybe not. Most people probably aren't on the lookout for undercover robots.

Yukari Takeba
Hey, you saw that the exam results were posted today, right?
It's great if you did well, but even if you didn't, try not to worry too much.
With everything that's been going on, I'm sure you did the best you could.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Hey, you don't think Amada-kun is gonna end up getting involved in all this, do you?

Minato Arisato - Selection
He won't.
I have no idea.
It's possible.

Yukari Takeba
Okay... I feel a little better about it now. Thanks.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Yeah... To be honest, I'm a little worried about it...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I guess you're right...
Sad - Ikutsuki-san did say that he has the potential...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I still can't believe Amada-kun moved into this dorm...
Sad - I really hope he doesn't get dragged into our mess...

Yukari Takeba
A country is made up of its people...
So, if the number of the Lost keeps growing, then the whole country will eventually collapse...
Sad - *sigh* There's so much riding on our shoulders...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - It's hard to describe how...
But have you noticed that Sanada-senpai acts a little different around Amada-kun?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sort of.
I had no idea.

Yukari Takeba
I wonder why... Maybe he doesn't get along with kids?
He does seem a bit socially awkward.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Do you just not notice that kind of stuff?
Anyway, I wonder what it is... I've never seen him like that before.

Yukari Takeba
Koro-chan is so awesome! He was so brave that day!
Happy - I don't know how he was trained, but he's amazing!

Yukari Takeba
At our archery tournament, a bunch of students didn't show up because of Apathy Syndrome.
I guess we have to work even harder...

Yukari Takeba
Do you remember that Shadow from the other day?
Oh, I'm talking about the one Koro-chan defeated.
Anyway, for some reason, it reminded me of something Kirijo-senpai said...
About how normal Shadows don't usually appear outside Tartarus, but some irregular ones do.
I guess they appeared sometimes back when it was just our senpais who were fighting them.

Yukari Takeba
Junpei should really join a school club or something. He looks so bored every day.
He would probably have fun on some sports team. He always has so much energy, after all.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Whew, it's so hot... It's really starting to feel like summer...
Exasperated* - I don't want to get heat exhaustion before the next operation, so I'm gonna stay inside today.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Wait, we're gonna have to fight the Shadow in this heat, aren't we?
Exasperated* - Ugh... This mission's gonna be tough...

Yukari Takeba
I'm starting to get nervous about tomorrow...
I think I'm gonna check one more time to make sure I'm fully prepared.

Yukari Takeba
So if the Dark Hour disappears, then our Personas will disappear too.
That's basically what those Strega guys were saying, right?

Yukari Takeba
Summer school, huh...? Well, it's not that I hate studying that much, but...
I just don't think we should have to go to school during summer vacation, ya know?

Yukari Takeba
Summer school starts tomorrow... Honestly, the more I think about it, the more I'm dreading it...

Junpei Iori
Sad - Damn right...
Sad - Hey, Koromaru, wanna switch places with me?

Yukari Takeba
It looks like Kirijo-senpai and Sanada-senpai went out again.
How do they still have energy after summer school?
Sad - I'm so tired... I think I'm gonna go to bed early tonight...

Yukari Takeba
Oh, today's the summer festival, huh?
Happy - Well, I already made other plans with some friends, so I won't be going this year.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - I was trying to cook something and kinda messed it up, and Koro-chan happened to be nearby...
Exasperated* - So I asked him if he wanted a bite. I was just joking, but he ran away so fast...
Exasperated* - I mean, I know it didn't come out right, but I didn't think it was that bad...

Yukari Takeba
Hey, I was thinking...
What do you think will happen to us if the Dark Hour disappears?

Minato Arisato - Selection
We'll go back to normal.
It doesn't matter.

Yukari Takeba
Yeah, that's what I think too. Those Strega guys said our Persona abilities will disappear, so...
We'll probably just go back to being ordinary high school students.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Haha, I guess you're kinda right.
Happy - We still have to keep fighting anyway, don't we?
Happy - You've probably thought about this more than I have, huh?

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I guess there isn't much point thinking about stuff like this. I should be focusing on fighting, right?

Yukari Takeba
Summer vacation is almost over, but I still have some homework left to do...
*sigh* I'll get back to it after a short break.

Yukari Takeba
Junpei hasn't even touched his homework.
Exasperated* - He keeps saying that he wants to go to Tartarus instead. Talk about escapism...

Yukari Takeba
Amada-kun's only supposed to stay at the dorm for the summer, right?
I guess that means he'll be heading home soon...
Sad - Even though he wasn't here for very long, it's still gonna be sad to see him go...

Yukari Takeba
Geez, why is Junpei trying so hard to act like a senpai?
Well, since he's not in any clubs, I guess this is his first chance to actually be a senpai.

Yukari Takeba
*sigh* Junpei's being weird again...
He's just going on about something he's "super into"...
Well, maybe, just for a day, he should be "super into" getting his homework done.

Yukari Takeba
Did Junpei finally give up on finishing his homework?
He looks kinda out of it. I wonder if he's all right...

Yukari Takeba
If she wears a summer uniform, everyone will be able to see her mechanical arms.
So we decided she should wear a winter uniform.
Wearing this in the summer's a little weird, but I don't think it's "she must be a robot" weird, right?

Yukari Takeba
Aragaki-senpai's the guy who helped us out at that place, isn't he?
And he used to be with SEES, huh? So we'll be fighting with him from now on...
Oh, I didn't mean to sound like I have a problem with that. I know he's a good guy deep down.

Yukari Takeba
He's already so dumb all the time, I forget that, sometimes, he can go even dumber.
You know, Aragaki-senpai just joined us, so...
We really don't need Junpei anymore, do we?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, let's get rid of him.
You're kidding, right?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Calm down, I was just kidding! I don't really want to get rid of him completely...
Exasperated* - I just wish he wasn't so annoying.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Haha! Yeah, I'm just kidding. I just wish he wasn't so annoying.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Junpei seems to be really serious about that girl.
Um... As his teammates, I feel like maybe we should do something... But what?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Encourage him.
Leave him be.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - "Encourage him," huh? Honestly, I don't even know how I'd do that...

Yukari Takeba
Hmm... Yeah, I guess you're right. It's not like we know the full story anyways.
Sad - But I wonder if that's really all we can do...

Yukari Takeba
Junpei...
Sad - Um... I'm not gonna mess with him today...

Yukari Takeba
Can you feel it too?
When you go near Junpei, it's like... How do I put it? Like he's... radiating happiness, maybe?
Exasperated* - Did something happen to him...?

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I'm so glad that Aragaki-senpai decided to return to the team.
I mean, he's strong in battle, but also just knowing that he's on our side kinda puts me at ease.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Yeah, I agree.
He looks kind of scary, but in reality, he's such a strong and kind senpai.

Yukari Takeba
Can you feel it too?
When you go near Junpei, it's like... How do I put it? Like he's... radiating happiness, maybe?
Exasperated* - Did something happen to him...?

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Guess what! I have to wear a maid outfit!
Angry - Ugh, this is so messed up!

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'm sorry.
Who cares?
I want you to wear it.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - *sigh* Yeah, thanks... God, this is so embarrassing! Maybe I'll just run away...

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Whaddaya mean, "who cares"!? I care! This is gonna be the most embarrassing thing ever!

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - What...? You like that kind of stuff?
Sad - Um... I didn't think you were like that.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Ugh, I hate this... Why don't they consider the feelings of the one who has to wear it?

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I hate to say it, but... I'm so relieved the festival got canceled.
I mean, come on, a maid outfit!?
I'd rather stand outside in the middle of the typhoon than have to wear a maid outfit.

Yukari Takeba
Oh, you seem to be feeling better.
Happy - Why don't you go get some fresh air? It's really nice out.

Yukari Takeba
Oh, that's right...
I should've made you some rice porridge when you were sick.
Sad - Sorry I didn't think of that sooner...
Happy - Next time you get sick, I'll be sure to make it.

Yukari Takeba
Only three Shadows left... I bet they're gonna be tough.

Aigis
Yes, that is the most likely scenario.
It will be difficult to win without thorough training in Tartarus.

Yukari Takeba
The other day, I saw Koro-chan eating something other than his usual dog food.
Do you know who got it for him? Or maybe someone made it?
He looked so happy eating it.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I can kinda understand why Amada-kun tends to keep to himself.
Sad - I can't explain it well, but... things that happen when you're little affect how you turn out, so...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Yes, that's true...

Yukari Takeba
Only three Shadows left...
Sad - You'd think I'd be used to it by now, but as the day gets closer, I still get nervous...

Yukari Takeba
So we have midterms this month...
There should be a rule against exams being too soon after an operation.

Yukari Takeba
It's almost that time again... Are you ready?
Sad - I hope things go as smoothly as always... But, for some reason, I have a bad feeling this time...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - "Nowhere else to go," huh...?
Sad - Fuuka's right. I should've considered his feelings...
Sad - I wonder what he's doing now...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I'm so glad Amada-kun came back.
He really was prepared to get revenge and leave this world. It's tragic for a kid to think that way...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I'm glad he's back too.
Sad - Honestly, I was so worried... What if something terrible happened and he never came back...?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - There's no way I can study right now...
Sad - Not when a close friend just died...
Sad - I can't just forget about it and move on...
Sad - I just... can't do that...

Yukari Takeba
If the Dark Hour disappears...
I'll probably spend more time with the archery team.
Between studying and fighting Shadows, I haven't been as involved as I'd like to be.

Yukari Takeba
I don't feel relieved like I usually do after exams. Do you?

Minato Arisato - Selection
No, I don't either.
I feel completely relieved.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Yeah...
Sad - Our final operation's coming up. I'm not really sure how to feel...

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Really?
Sad - I'm too worried about the last operation coming up to be relieved about anything.
I guess you're just calmer about these things than me.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - And the final operation is so soon after exams... *sigh* What a way to finish things up...

Yukari Takeba
Well, the exam results have been posted...
Now that we don't have that hanging over our heads anymore, let's focus on Tartarus.
The next operation will be our last one, so let's put our all into preparing for it.

Yukari Takeba
Fuuka's really changed, don't you think?
She used to be so reserved, but now...
Happy - I guess she's still kinda quiet, but she's a lot more open, y'know?

Yukari Takeba
The city will return to normal once we defeat the next Shadow, right?
Happy - All right, then let's show 'em who's boss, Arisato-kun!

Yukari Takeba
I know it's a little strange to ask this now, but... do you have a reason you're fighting?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I do.
Nope.
I don't know.

Yukari Takeba
I see. I'm glad for you.
Happy - Anyway, the next battle will be our last. I guess I don't need to tell you, but let's do our best!

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Haha! You sound so casual about it.
Happy - Well, reason or not, we've gotten this far, so let's see it through to the end.

Yukari Takeba
I see... Well, I hope you find one.
Either way, the next battle will be our last, so let's do our best.

Yukari Takeba
The next battle will settle everything... Let's make extra sure we win, Arisato-kun.

Yukari Takeba
Ugh, Junpei keeps going on and on about how we're heroes or something...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Of course! We're savin' the whole city, aren't we?
Happy - Plus, if we beat the next mission, we'll be undefeated!
Happy - We'll be real heroes!

Yukari Takeba
Hm...
I never really thought about it that way, but I see your point...
I guess we better make sure we win the next battle, then.

Yukari Takeba
Do you think Koro-chan knows that this next operation will be our last?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I think he does.
No, I don't think so.

Yukari Takeba
So do I. Koro-chan is really smart. And they say animals have good instincts.

Yukari Takeba
Maybe we should figure out a way to tell him, then.
I think he'd like to know that he's finally about to avenge his owner.

Yukari Takeba
Only three more days till the full moon...
Sad - It's finally starting to hit me... I'm kinda nervous...
Sad - I gotta keep it together. I should try to relax a little...

Yukari Takeba
This will make all the Shadows disappear, right?
Along with the Dark Hour, Tartarus, and everything else?
Sad - Well, no... It won't make my dad's sins disappear...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I really thought it was all gonna be over...
Sad - What're we supposed to do now...?

Yukari Takeba
It's hard to believe in something. Just because you believe doesn't make it true, after all.
Personally, I almost stopped believing so many times...
But, ultimately, I'm glad that I kept holding on to that belief.
Happy - Because it turns out that my dad has always been the dad that I believed he was.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I wonder what'll happen now...
Sad - The Shadows, Tartarus, and the Dark Hour are all still here...
Sad - The whole reason we were fighting was for nothing, and now we're just stuck here...
Angry - Argh! This is pissing me off! Damn you, Ikutsuki!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Um, please calm down, Yukari-chan. Getting angry won't help...

Aigis
That is correct. It would be more productive to refrain from thinking about him at all.

Yukari Takeba
I don't like how Ryoji-kun hits on all the girls.
Well, he's pretty good-looking, so a lot of them probably don't mind.
Unlike Junpei, who couldn't get a girl if he was the last guy on the planet. I almost feel bad for him.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - I heard that! How dare you say something like that about this hunk of burning love!

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - "Hunk of burning love"? What's that? It sounds kinda dangerous. We better avoid it...

Yukari Takeba
Ryoji-kun transferred here at such a weird time of year.
Maybe it was because of his parents...? What do they do, anyway?
It seems like no one really knows anything about him.
Hm... He's pretty mysterious...

Yukari Takeba
Hey, I heard we're going to Kyoto for the school trip.
Sad - Hmm...

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Everyone's so overly excited about Kyoto.
Exasperated* - I mean, there's a bunch of historic landmarks, but other than that, it's not much different from here.

Yukari Takeba
I wasn't born in Kyoto or anything, I just lived there for a bit.
Exasperated* - But our classmates keep asking if I'll show them around. It's getting annoying...
Exasperated* - I know they're just excited for the trip, but I'm not really in the mood to be everyone's tour guide...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Well, it's not like it'll help fix our current situation...
But maybe a trip will give us a chance to clear our heads or something...

Aigis
Yes. Besides, partaking of a school trip is a rare occurrence.
It would be suboptimal to waste such an opportunity.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Yeah, I guess so...

Yukari Takeba
I told you I used to live in Kyoto, right?
Happy - So I've already seen most of the famous sights.
Happy - But I never realized the sunset at Kamogawa River was that beautiful.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - I hope you've thought about what you did.
Sad - Honestly, I'd rather just forget the whole thing...
Angry - But you better not forget your punishment. Maybe you'll think twice before trying that again.

Yukari Takeba
Work, huh...?
My dad did his very best when he was working...
He was a hard worker, and he never complained...
Happy - Then again, he didn't do the kind of work we're gonna be doing.

Yukari Takeba
Oh, I almost forgot, we have tomorrow off. Labor Day, right?
But then career experience starts right after that...
Exasperated* - *sigh* Bummer, huh?

Yukari Takeba
She was the first girl Junpei's ever been serious about...
Sad - Do you think he'll be okay...?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, eventually.
I'm not sure.

Yukari Takeba
Yeah, I hope so...
Thanks for saying that, though. It makes me feel a little better.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Yeah, I guess you can't be, but...
Sad - Hearing you say it out loud makes me worry even more...

Yukari Takeba
Career experience was such a drag...
I wasn't looking forward to it to begin with, but... then with what happened to Junpei...
Sad - I can't stop thinking about it. I really hope he'll be okay...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - That drawing of Junpei actually made him look good!

Yukari Takeba
Aigis didn't like Ryoji-kun from the moment she met him.
Do you think they just have clashing personalities or something?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, something like that.
Eh, who cares?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - It's probably because he's always flirting. To be honest, I don't really like him that much either.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Haha, yeah, you're right. It's none of my business.

Yukari Takeba
I've never seen Aigis hate someone before, but I guess everyone has their own pet peeves.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Everyone is going to die? What the hell!
Angry - We're all just trying to live our lives the best we can!
Angry - And now, what, it's all just gonna end? You gotta be kidding me!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I think everyone is going to need some time to process everything...
Sad - It was all... so sudden...
But we should still go through everything we know. Do you wanna go over it together?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Sorry, I'm still trying to wrap my mind around everything. Can you help me go over it all?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Can we avoid the Fall?
What if we let Ryoji live?
What if we kill Ryoji?
So what do we do?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - He said it's impossible...
Sad - Nyx is death itself, so we can't avoid it...
Sad - ...or defeat it.

Yukari Takeba
If we let Ryoji-kun live, we'll have to face Nyx.
And, apparently, Nyx is undefeatable.
Sad - That's so unfair...

Yukari Takeba
The coming of the Fall may be delayed by a little...
Sad - But our memories related to the Dark Hour will disappear.
Sad - It may be the easiest way, but I don't think that I want that...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Well, we'll have to make a decision...
Sad - But I don't want to run away...

Yukari Takeba
Ryoji-kun said, "the unification was interrupted"...
Sad - That was probably from what my dad did, huh...?
Sad - My dad stood up to the Fall back then, so now it's my turn...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I wonder what Ryoji-kun is doing right now...
Sad - He actually seemed the most upset about the world coming to an end.
Sad - I can't help worrying about him too...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - ......

Mitsuru Kirijo
That's right. He doesn't wish for the Fall to happen, either.
I'm sure he wants the same thing we do...

Yukari Takeba
Everyone's been thinking about the decision we have to make. Have you given it any thought?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I've been trying to.
Not at all.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Yeah, me too. It's not an easy decision to make...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Haha, really? I guess I'm not surprised, though.
Sad - Sometimes, I want to stop thinking about it too... The more I think about it, the more unsure I am...

Yukari Takeba
When you saved us on that monorail, I thought I understood the weight of life...
Sad - But it turns out it's actually way heavier than I thought...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Don't worry about what Junpei said earlier, okay?
You know, all that stuff about how Ryoji-kun was inside you.
No one thinks it's your fault.
You're still you. The same person now as you've always been.

Yukari Takeba
It sucks that we have exams at a time like this... Are you studying for them?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, I am.
No, I'm not.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Seriously? Wow...
Surprised - I'm impressed that you're able to concentrate with all that's going on.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Yeah... Me neither.
I guess it's a little late to start studying now, but let's try to do our best.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I know I should be studying, but my mind keeps wandering...

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - You're not gonna say, "Why aren't you studying?" or something like that?
Angry - Just so you know, it would be pretty rude to interrupt a conversation like that.
Besides, it's important to take breaks, too.

Mitsuru Kirijo
You're right.
And last minute studying won't make much of a difference, anyway.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Wait, is that your way of saying we're hopeless?
That's not very nice, Senpai.

Yukari Takeba
The exams are finally over, but I don't feel relieved at all... I'm just even more tired.
This is the same way I felt after the last midterms...
We thought it was going to be the last battle, but it wasn't...
Sad - *sigh* The more I think about it, the more miserable I feel...

Yukari Takeba
It's not like me to just give up.
No matter what the outcome is, I want to know that I fought for my future.
Happy - That's what I've decided.

Yukari Takeba
The other day, I was flipping through a magazine when I saw this poll...
It was about how much money people want their partners to spend on their Christmas presents.
I'm usually interested in that kind of thing, but not right now.
Happy - I guess stuff like money and presents doesn't feel like it matters a whole lot anymore, huh?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Oh, you're back...
Sad - Um... I was just wondering who you were spending Christmas with...
Sad - ......
Sad - Uh, never mind. Sorry. I don't mean to be so gloomy...
Sad - It's not like we promised to spend the day together or anything, so...

Yukari Takeba
Well, Christmas is over now.
All that's left is New Year's Eve...
Have you made your decision?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I have.
No...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Oh, good!

Yukari Takeba
Well, we still have a few days left to think about it, so don't rush.
Take your time and make sure it's a decision you can live with.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I think that whatever decision you make will be the right one, so don't worry about it too much.

Yukari Takeba
Doesn't everyone seem a little different lately?
Happy - It's like they've all come to a realization or something.

Minato Arisato - Selection
You're right.
You think so?

Yukari Takeba
I wonder if that means everyone's made up their minds about Ryoji-kun...

Yukari Takeba
You can't tell? I feel like it's pretty obvious.
Then again, I can't tell what you're thinking, or if you've made your decision or not.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - It finally feels like the team is complete with Aigis back.
Happy - But she's changed so much, don't you think? She seems so... "human" now.
We probably shouldn't treat her like a robot anymore, huh?

Yukari Takeba
I already know my decision. And I have for some time now, actually.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - There's no way we're just gonna sit back and let the Fall happen.

Yukari Takeba
Junpei's such an idiot... A new year just started and he's already being a pervert.
And right after making such a serious decision, too!
Exasperated* - And I can't believe the stuff he was saying to Amada-kun either...

Yukari Takeba
Have you seen the headlines?
The ones like, "New Cult Gaining Popularity," and, "Apocalyptic Ideology Spreading"?
Sad - Something tells me it all has to do with Nyx...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Things are getting out of hand in the city...
Sad - Before, you could see the Lost here and there, but now they're everywhere...

Aigis
Many people have been affected by Nyx.
I fear it may get even worse as we get closer to the day of Nyx's arrival.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It's astonishing that Nyx can affect an entire city like this. It just goes to show how strong it is...
But we're the only ones who can do something about it, so we have to fight no matter what.

Yukari Takeba
Everyone's so interested in the cult. There are news reports on it every single day.
Sad - It makes me sick... I hope our school won't be obsessed with it too.

Minato Arisato - Selection
It might be, though.
I'm sure it'll be fine.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Ugh, that would suck... I don't even want to think about it.

Yukari Takeba
I really hope so... It'd be seriously depressing if it wasn't...

Yukari Takeba
I thought at least our school would be safe from that cult crap...
Sad - But I guess I was wrong...
Sad - All our classmates are talking about the end of the world and salvation and stuff.
Sad - Why do we have to go through this at school too...?

Yukari Takeba
That cult is everywhere. All over the city, even in our school...
Everyone is talking about how the world is going to end as if it's fact.

Junpei Iori
Angry - Yeah... How can they give up so easily?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Then again, we can't really expect everyone to think like us...

Aigis
Yes. Every human is different and will come to their own conclusions.
But that's why I believe there are more people out there who won't give up either.

Yukari Takeba
I think Strega is controlling people by taking advantage of their insecurities.
So if people have enough confidence, Strega probably can't influence them.
I mean, for one, none of us have been swayed by their preaching, right?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Right.
I just don't care.
I'd listen to them.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Yeah. So, no matter what, just don't forget who you are and what you really believe in.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Haha, that's actually probably a good attitude to take towards that cult.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Wow, you must be pretty confident, cracking a joke like that at a time like this.

Yukari Takeba
No matter what, we have to hold strong to our beliefs. Let's never forget that.

Yukari Takeba
I don't really know how they do it... But, however they do it, I think they're right to.
I'm actually feeling kind of inspired, so maybe I'll do some studying on my own, too.
Happy - Oh, but I'll also definitely go to Tartarus if you want.

Yukari Takeba
It's getting pretty obvious who believes in the cult and who doesn't.
Do you have any friends besides us who don't believe in the cult?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I think so.
None.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - That's reassuring. I think this kind of thing really reflects a person's virtue.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Oh... That's a little discouraging.
But I'm sure there are more people out there who have strong values and won't be influenced.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - We gave Koro-chan a special dinner today!
Happy - He needs to keep up his strength for the final battle, after all. Aww, look how happy he is!

Koromaru
Happy - Arf!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Heheh, what a lucky boy you are, right, Koro-chan?
Happy - Eat a lot and get strong, okay?

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I was so sad seeing Junpei like that back then...
Happy - I'm so happy for him.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - The timing for this couldn't be worse.
Sad - We have to figure out what we want in the future now of all times? Seriously?
Well, what about you, Arisato-kun? Do you know what you want to do?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yes, I do.
No, I don't.
How about you?

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Wow, you really have it together! Then your consultation will be a breeze, huh?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Well, we are only second-years, so we still have time to think about it.
Happy - Just make sure you're not thinking about it in the middle of a battle.

Yukari Takeba
Yeah, I think I have an idea.

Yukari Takeba
To be honest, I think it's still kinda early to decide what we want to do for the rest of our lives.
I wonder if Fuuka and Junpei already know what they want to do...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - The "Promised Day"... Honestly, I'm still pretty freaked out by the whole thing.
Happy - But... I feel all right, because we're all gonna take it on together.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Don't you get nervous when it's the Dark Hour and you're all alone in your room?
Well, I do... I feel better if I'm in the lounge until it's over.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Geez, how does Junpei's mind work?
How is he so engrossed in instant ramen at a time like this?
I mean, I'd understand if it were a fruit parfait or something.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - My father couldn't stop the experiment from happening...
Sad - When I close my eyes, I see his sad face, just like in that video...
I'm gonna get rid of the Dark Hour so he can smile again.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Oh, hey! I didn't expect to run into you here. Are you shopping too?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yup.
I'm here for something else.
How about you?

Yukari Takeba
Getting some supplies for tonight? Thanks for always being on top of everything.
Happy - I should make sure my weapons are ready when I get back later. Well, let's do our best tonight!

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Yeah, I guess it's a nice time to take a walk and look around, too.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I'm here to check out the new spring collection clothes with Mitsuru-senpai.
Happy - We've never really gone shopping together before, so we thought, "Why not now?"
Happy - Plus, if we start prepping for the battle this early, I'll be worn out before it even begins.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I joined Yukari to go shopping, but...
Happy - There are so many fashion trends and designers I don't know of.
Happy - Heh, I certainly can't let myself forget all this, now can I?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - My dad delayed the Fall until now...
So he could pass the baton to me.
I'm going to run with it until the very end.

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Hey. It's another hot day...
Maybe I'll just stay inside today.
Exasperated* - I was actually gonna go to the film festival with my friend, but now she says she can't go.
Exasperated* - I was honestly looking forward to it, so it's kind of a bummer...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari seems interested in
going to the film festival.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I feel as if we can grow closer thanks to the
 Persona, ****...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I invite Yukari to the film festival?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Invite to the movies
Check Social Link status
Don't invite

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Huh? You want to go?
Happy - All right, then! Sure!
Happy - I hope you're into the kinda stuff they're showing today, though, 'cause we'll be seeing a lot of it!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari seems excited.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I invite Yukari to the film festival?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Invite to the movies
Don't invite

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Huh? You want to go?
Sorry, I wasn't trying to guilt you into taking me or anything...
But I do hate going alone, so yeah, let's go!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari seems excited.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Look at that idiot... How can he eat hot food when it's already scorching in here?
Exasperated* - I feel like I'm getting hotter just watching him!
Exasperated* - You think you could get him out of here for a little? He's seriously starting to bother me...

Junpei Iori
Geez, Yuka-tan, sorry to "bother" you so much... But I'll make it up to ya!
Here, you can have half! But you gotta use my chopsticks, 'cause I don't have any spares.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Why would I want any!?
Whatever. I'm gonna go do my homework. If I can even focus on it in this heat...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari seems busy.
I doubt she's in the mood
to go to the movies...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - All of those movies were great, but more importantly... there was air conditioning!
Happy - Haha, I'm just kidding. I really had fun.
Happy - Thanks for inviting me!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I promised myself I'd do my homework first thing, but my room was too hot, so I came out here...
Sad - My friend's coming to compare notes, so I have to finish... Ugh, sorry, I'm rambling. Just ignore me.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari seems busy.
I doubt she's in the mood
to go to the movies...

Yukari Takeba
I'm almost done with my homework.
Every year, I tell myself I should just finish my homework in July, but then I never actually do it...
Exasperated* - At least I'm not as bad as Junpei. I bet he hasn't even started.
Exasperated* - He can beg all he wants, but I'm not gonna let him copy off mine.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari seems busy.
I doubt she's in the mood
to go to the movies...

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Junpei's still fooling around...
Exasperated* - He'd better get started on that homework, or he'll be in trouble.
As for me, I'm all done! I've got so much stuff I gotta catch up on now that I have free time again.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari seems to have already made plans.
I doubt she's in the mood
to go to the movies...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Right now, the Temperance Arcana
may help me grow even more...

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Hm? What's up?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Come to think of it, Elizabeth asked
me to get a specific item for her...

Yukari Takeba
Huh? You're looking for pine resin...?
Why would I have something like that on me...?
Surprised - Ohhh, do you mean the powder we use on the archery team? The yellow stuff?
Happy - We use it during practice, so it runs out pretty quick... Lemme check if I still have any left.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I found some! Here you go.
Happy - It can get sticky if you use too much all at once, so go easy on it.

===============================================================================================

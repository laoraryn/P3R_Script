Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Hey, can we go look at some earrings?   
Happy - We didn't end up going last time, remember? I still need to check out what new pieces they have!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hm? It's that kid...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, there.   
   
Child   
Mommy!   
   
Child's Mother   
Oh, there you are! You need to stay by Mommy's side, okay?   
   
Child   
Okay!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
He was with his mother today, huh...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's a relief.   
What's wrong?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah. Kinda looked like he was lost again, so I was worried for a second there...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Nothing... I was just remembering something.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I've heard that no matter how careful you try to be, kids just love wandering off on their own...   
Especially when they're that young. Must be hard being a mother.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Anyway, you ready to go?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hmm, none of the earrings caught my eye...   
Maybe I should find a new shop to check out. If I go on a day off, I could look somewhere a little further from home.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - But if I go out on my own again, who knows what creeps might come after me...? The news hasn't been very reassuring.   
Gee, what should I do? If only someone would come with me...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'll go.   
Good luck.   
What's the magic word?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Hehe, thanks! I'll treat you to something when we get there.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Hey, take a hint!   
Fine, I'll be blunt. Could you come with me? I'll treat you to something!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Uhh... Pleeeaaase?   
Exasperated* - ......   
Happy - Okay, sorry. I'll be real with you. I'd love it if you'd be able to come with me.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Haha, so much for being afraid to rely on others, huh? Now it just slips out.   
I'll have to learn to hold back, too.   
I can't ask for too much, but I shouldn't do everything by myself, either...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I guess it'll all balance out if you start relying on me more, too.   
Happy - At least, that's what I think.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, right... I wanted to give you something.   
That's actually why I wanted to hang out today.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
DEV: *Unused message labels.  *If this appears, it is a bug.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You know what it is, right? It's the strap from my cell phone.   
I got it at the opening ceremony for the Moonlight Bridge.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It's been my special keepsake for many years...   
Because my dad bought it for me.   
I used to talk to the little charm attached to it when I was alone in my room.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Haha... You must think I'm nuts, huh?   
But it was pretty much the only thing that got me through.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I can honestly say I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for that little guy.   
Happy - So I was just thinking, maybe it could help you in some way too.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Can I really have this?   
That's intense.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yup. I'm doing better these days, so I'd like you to have it.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Hey, don't look at me like that! Just accept the gesture, okay? Geez.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I can feel the tight bond   
between me and Yukari...

The Lovers Social Link reached its maximum level! You can now fuse **Cybele**, the earth mother!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, right, so as we were saying... It'd be nice to go someplace a little further from home.   
Happy - We've talked about this before, remember? About going out to the mountains or something.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Let's make good on that, okay? We could even go to Destinyland!   
Happy - I can't wait to make some more fun memories together!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - All right, well, now that that's decided, it's time to start planning!   
Happy - Give some thought to where you'd like to go, okay?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari and I returned to the dorm.

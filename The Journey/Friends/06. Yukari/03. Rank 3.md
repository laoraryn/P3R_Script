Yukari Takeba
Happy - Hey, what do you wanna do now? Karaoke?

Child
Mommy! Where are you?

Yukari Takeba
...?

Child
M-Mooommy! Where aaaaaare you!?

Yukari Takeba
Hey, what's wrong? Are you lost?

Child
M-Mommy told me to wait here... and... and... she gave me money, but...
She's... She's not coming back...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Hey, don't cry...
Happy - See, you're okay now.
Happy - I'll stay here with you, all right?

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Hey, look! We can get help over there!

Yukari Takeba
Happy - C'mon, follow me.
Happy - The policeman will know what to do.
Happy - He'll find your mom, so don't worry.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Phew, what a relief... I'm glad he was able to contact the parents.
Angry - What were they thinking, leaving that poor kid all alone!?
Angry - Stuff like that really makes me upset!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - But...
Sad - I guess my own mom's no different.

Minato Arisato - Selection
What makes you say that?
......

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Why do you wanna know?

Yukari Takeba
Sorry, I didn't mean to poke fun at you.
Remember what I told you before, how my mom and I aren't very close?
Well, if you asked me what kind of parent she is, I'd say, "a terrible one."

Yukari Takeba
She wasn't always like that, though.
Sad - After what happened to Dad, she totally changed...
She's probably living with one of her boyfriends somewhere... Honestly, I'd rather not know.

Yukari Takeba
...Don't you want to know what I mean?
You must be trying not to pry... Or is that my own wishful thinking?
Well, I guess you're right, it's a personal matter.

Yukari Takeba
Even if you did ask, I don't know what I'd say. I have no idea what she's up to these days.
Probably shacking up with one of her boyfriends. That's about all I know.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Anyway, I'm done talking about this, okay?

Yukari Takeba
Um... Arisato-kun, could we keep this between you and me? You're the only one I've told.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari has confided in me about her
complicated relationship with her mother.
It seems we've grown closer...

Yukari Takeba
Sorry... I'm not in the mood for karaoke anymore.
Let's go home.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I parted with Yukari and
went back to the dorm...

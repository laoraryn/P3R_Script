Yukari Takeba   
Hm, I dunno about the net café... Why don't we go someplace else?   
Wait, let me see how much money I have...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Oh no! Where's my wallet!? Did I drop it?   
Sad - But, when? I had it when I pulled out my train pass...   
Sad - Wait... Someone bumped into me outside the station!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sorry, I'm gonna go back there and look around. It'll just take a minute!   
Make sure you wait right here, okay?   
I'll be fine, so don't come after me!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Stay right there, you got it!?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari vehemently warned me and ran off...   
What should I do?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Look around   
Wait here   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
......   
I'm starting to get weird looks...   
It doesn't seem like she's coming back...   
Did something happen...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Go look for her   
Wait a bit longer   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I decided to go check up on her.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
......   
More and more people are staring...   
Yukari still hasn't come back.   
I should check up on her.

Fierce Guy   
What'd you say!? You better shut your mouth, bitch!   
   
Smirking Guy   
If you don't behave, you'll lose more than just your wallet.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - ......   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'll take you on.   
I'll call the police.   
What's going on?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - ...!   
   
Fierce Guy   
Huh? Who the hell are you?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Hey, didn't I tell you to wait back there?   
   
Fierce Guy   
Huh? Who the hell are you?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Her boyfriend.   
Her friend.   
Just a passerby.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Hey, wait! What are you saying!?   
   
Fierce Guy   
You really gotta brag, huh? Time to beat the shit outta you!   
   
Smirking Guy   
We've got no business with a measly buddy. If you don't wanna get hurt, then get lost!   
   
Fierce Guy   
The hell? You're askin' for a beatdown!   
   
Smirking Guy   
Then mind your own damn business. You lookin' for trouble? Huh?   
   
Fierce Guy   
What, you tryin' to show off to this chick? You're outnumbered!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Th-Thanks.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari seems appreciative.   
It seems we've grown closer...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - That was a little... intense, though. You didn't have to beat them up so badly.   
Sad - ......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Hey, why'd you come after me?   
Sad - Didn't I say to wait?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Did you think I needed saving?   
Sad - ......   
Angry - I'm not helpless, you know.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - I got my wallet back by myself.   
Angry - I didn't need your help!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'm sorry.   
It's okay to rely on others.   
You're a girl, so...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - ......   
Sad - Don't apologize...   
Sad - I should be the one saying sorry. And... thank you.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - I'll just go on ahead... I'm all right now. Sorry again.   
Sad - See you...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - No it isn't! I'm telling you, I don't want to spend my life relying on men!   
Angry - I...   
Sad - ......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Sorry, I overreacted. You came because you were worried about me, right?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - I'll just go on ahead... I'm all right now. Sorry again.   
Sad - See you...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
[cut 2 2 1]   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - What's that supposed to mean!? So what if I'm a girl!?   
Angry - Am I supposed to just hide behind men all my life, like my mom!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - Don't mock me like this...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very angry* - I never asked for your help. I... I'm fine on my own!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
There's an uncomfortable   
tension between us...   
It seems my words struck a nerve.   
Our relationship is becoming unstable...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - ...I-I'm going home.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I saw Yukari off, then returned to the dorm...

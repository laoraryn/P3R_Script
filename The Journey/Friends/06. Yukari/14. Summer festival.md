Happy - Oh! That yukata is so cute!
Huh... I didn't know they made ones like that.
Sad - If I was gonna bother to wear one, I should've shopped around more before deciding...

Minato Arisato - Selection
You have a nicer figure.
It looks great on you.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Really?
Wait... Since when were you so bold about that stuff?

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I guess I'll take it as a compliment.

Yukari Takeba
But still, yukatas are a bit... how should I say, "breezy"?
It's great for warm weather, but the fabric is so thin... I don't know how people get used to it.

Yukari Takeba
I guess women in the old days were just that laid-back.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Huh!? They gyuh—

I mean, thanks...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Geez... I wasn't expecting that! I tripped over my own words...
Happy - Kind of you to say, though.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Mmm, something smells good...
I guess it's dinner time, huh? No wonder I'm so hungry.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Hey, Arisato-kun, wanna get some takoyaki?
Happy - I don't think I could eat the whole thing by myself, so why don't we share an order?

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Hi, I'd like one order of takoyaki, please!
Happy - Let's see... Could I have some extra seaweed and bonito flakes? And go easy on the mayo!

Takoyaki Vendor
Ohh, you know your stuff!
Gotcha! Comin' riiight up!

Takoyaki Vendor
Here ya go!
I threw in one extra just for you. Hope you and your boyfriend enjoy it!

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Thank you!

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Did you hear that, Arisato-kun? She called you my boyfriend.
Very happy* - Hehe...

Yukari Takeba
Very happy* - Mm... Tashtes hike Octchophia...
......

Yukari Takeba
Sorry... I know I shouldn't talk with my mouth full.
Happy - I was trying to say that it tastes like Octopia. You know, the place by the station?

Yukari Takeba
Hey, wait a minute... Do you think that lady at the stand was the same person?
Happy - Either way, it's delicious.

Yukari Takeba
Oooh, look at those masks...
Happy - I've never seen those in person before!

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Look, there's a dog one! Hey, doesn't it look a bit like Koro-chan?

Yukari Takeba
Oh, right... This shrine is his home.
Do you think they made that mask to honor him?

Yukari Takeba
Then again, this shop only came here for the festival... Maybe I'm just imagining it.

Happy - Nice, Arisato-kun!
I always assumed these things were rigged...
This might be the first time I've seen someone actually win something.

Yukari Takeba
I thought we'd see some of our classmates here, but I guess not.
Happy - I have to admit, I'm a little disappointed.
Happy - Still, I'm glad we got to enjoy the festivities.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Thanks for today! I had a lot of fun, Arisato-kun.
Happy - Let's go somewhere together again soon.
Very happy* - Hehe...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We decided to go back to the dorm.

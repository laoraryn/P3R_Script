Surprised - Oh! Arisato-kun!?
Oh, sorry. I was just thinking about you...
Uh...
......
Sad - Can we go somewhere else?

Minato Arisato - Selection
All right.
Why?

Yukari Takeba - MSG_002_0_0
Thanks...
Sad - Uh... You look like you're not feeling well. Sorry to bother you at a time like this, but I appreciate it.

Yukari Takeba - MSG_003_0_0
Sad - I dunno, sorry...
Sad - You look like you could use some rest anyway... Don't worry about it.
I'll see you later, then...

-----

Yukari Takeba
H-Hey, sorry for calling you out here...
I... actually have a little favor to ask.
Exasperated* - Um...

Yukari Takeba
I-It's about my mom!
I... want you to meet her.
......

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - I-I mean, not— Not in a weird way!
Sad - It's just that... I promised to meet up with her, but I'm still kind of scared.
Sad - If I see her, I... might end up saying some really nasty things...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - What if we end up hurting each other even more? I'm not trying to make her feel bad...
Sad - I haven't fully sorted out my feelings yet.
Exasperated* - But I do want to see her... I think.

Yukari Takeba
That's why I thought it'd be great if you could be there with me, Arisato-kun.
You don't have to say anything, really...
It's just that I'd feel more confident having you around.

Yukari Takeba
With you by my side, I think I could treat my mom with a little more kindness.
Sad - So, if it's not too much trouble... What do you think?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure.
That's a bit much.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - You'll do it!? Thank you!
Happy - Okay, I'll call her up right away! I've been putting this off for so long...
Sad - Sorry to wrap you up in my family situation.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - O-Of course, yeah!
Happy - I mean, meeting anyone's parents is already awkward... Mine would be ten times worse!
That's for sure...
Exasperated* - ......

Yukari Takeba
In any case, uh... it won't be right away. Besides, I still haven't gathered the confidence myself...
I'll just ask her when she's free. And if you don't have any plans that day... Well, think about it, okay?
Sad - ......
Happy - It really would make me happy if you came along.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Hey, um...
Sad - You must be thinking your life would be easier if I didn't have so many problems.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, maybe...
That's not true.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Ow, burn! You're supposed to deny that!
Angry - Geez... You're so dumb!
......

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Haha... Just kidding. I'm the one who said it.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - What, are you saying you actually like my problems?
Happy - Hey, don't worry about it! I was just joking, okay? Geez.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - You know, it's almost spring break.
Happy - It all went by so fast... We're gonna be third-years soon.
Happy - And after that, we'll graduate and go to college and... then become working adults, I guess.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Wow, it's hard to imagine...
Happy - Do you think... we'll still be together at that point?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Of course.
Who knows...?

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Yeah...
Happy - I think so, too.
Happy - ......

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - There you go again...
I get what you mean, though. It's hard to say what things will be like so far into the future.
I wonder what'll happen to us...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Well, let's talk about the near future, then.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Wanna go somewhere over spring break? Oh, how about Destinyland?
Happy - But just the two of us, okay...? You better not invite anyone else!
Happy - ......

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Like... if we stay the night, and stuff.
Happy - ......
Happy - I wonder if anyone at the dorms would notice if the two of us disappeared for a night...
Happy - ......
Happy - That's an embarrassing thought...
Happy - ......
Happy - W-We can talk more about it later.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Don't forget to save some time during spring break, okay?

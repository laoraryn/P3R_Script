Minato Arisato - Selection
Hello?
......
If it's nothing, I'm leaving.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Y-Yes! I'm here!
Whew, sorry. Don't scare me like that.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Oh...
You came... Thanks.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Huh...?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - H-Hey, wait! That's mean!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Er, I guess it's my fault... Sorry.

Yukari Takeba
So... there's something I want to ask you...
Um... Arisato-kun...
Sad - ......

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Why do you spend so much time with me?
Sad - It's gotten you into a whole mess of trouble...
Sad - And honestly... some of the stuff I've said is really not okay.

Yukari Takeba
Is it because we're both Persona-users?
Or are we actually good friends?
Sad - Or... do you, by any chance, have feelings for...?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari's voice is trembling. I'd better
choose my words carefully...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Come to think of it, **I have a special**
**relationship with another person already**...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - What do you really think of me?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I love you.
You're a precious friend.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - What...?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - No way... Are you serious?
Surprised - You're not pulling my leg, are you? You really mean it?

Yukari Takeba
Happy - W-Wow...

Yukari Takeba
Happy tears* - Ah...

Yukari Takeba
Happy tears* - Ahaha... Sorry. It just feels like a weight's been lifted off my shoulders...
Crying - The tears won't stop coming...

Yukari Takeba
Crying - ......
Crying - You're so hard to read, Arisato-kun...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - You're always so kind to everyone.
Sad - That's why I thought you saw me as just a friend, like everyone else.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Lately, I've found myself getting upset when I've seen you talking with Fuuka...
Sad - It made me scared that I was turning into a petty, jealous person... I felt awful about it.

Yukari Takeba
So, um... Arisato-kun...
I'd like it if you had eyes for me...
Sad - And only me...
Sad - ......

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can feel Yukari's affection.
I have entered a special
relationship with Yukari...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
There's no going back now...

Yukari Takeba
Crying - S-So, will you...

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Oh gosh! What am I saying!?
Surprised - I'm gonna go now!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - ...Yeah, I thought so.
Sad - I mean, you're always so nice to everyone.
Sad - It's not like I'm special...
Sad - Even so, uh... as a friend... do you like me?

Yukari Takeba
Happy tears* - I see... I'm glad to hear that.

Yukari Takeba
Crying - Ah...

Yukari Takeba
Happy tears* - Ahaha... Sorry. It just feels like a weight's been lifted off my shoulders...
Happy tears* - Aww, c'mon! Get it together, Yukari!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - ......
You know, Arisato-kun, your "like" and my "like" may be a little different...

Yukari Takeba
But we're connected in another way.
Happy - I think that's something special too. Don't you?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can feel Yukari's affection.
It seems we've grown closer...

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Oh gosh! What am I saying!? I'm gonna go cool my head for a bit!
Surprised - Starting tomorrow, this never happened, okay? I'll go on being your good friend! So...
Surprised - I'm gonna go now! Bye!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari left...
I decided to go back to the dorm.

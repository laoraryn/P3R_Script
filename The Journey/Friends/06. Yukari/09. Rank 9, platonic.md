Minato Arisato - Selection
Hello?
......
If it's nothing, I'm leaving.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Y-Yes! I'm here!
Sad - Oh, sorry... Don't scare me like that.

Yukari Takeba
Oh...
You came... Thanks.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Huh...?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - H-Hey, wait! That's mean!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Er, I guess it's my fault... Sorry.

Yukari Takeba
So... there's something I've been meaning to ask...
Um... Arisato-kun, are you...
......
Are you worried about anything?

Minato Arisato - Selection
What's this about?
Not really...

Yukari Takeba
You always seem to be the one listening to my problems, so...

Yukari Takeba
Are you sure? You don't have to bottle it up. I feel bad that we only ever talk about my issues...

Yukari Takeba
I just thought I could be of some help to you too.
Surprised - I mean, you're an important friend to me! Doesn't seem fair that it's been a one-way street...
Surprised - What I'm trying to say here is...

Yukari Takeba
You don't need to struggle on your own.
It feels like you're always helping others, and not taking care of yourself...
So... I want to be that person for you. I want to look after you the way you do for me.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Thank you.
You're exaggerating.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Hey, I'm the one who should be thanking you.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - I'm not! The fact that I'm always relying on you is proof.

Yukari Takeba
You know, I've always thought there was something special about you.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Remember when we first met? You were able to summon your Persona like it was nothing...
Happy - And unlike me, you were never afraid to face the Shadows head-on.

Yukari Takeba
It's like you're a superhero, saving the day for others in need...
I guess deep down, I thought maybe you didn't need any help from someone like me.

Yukari Takeba
But... just because someone is strong doesn't mean they have to do everything alone.
There's no shame in getting support from other people. And sometimes, that support can help you achieve even greater things.

Yukari Takeba
That's why I want to be there to help you.
I know that might sound weird coming from me.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can feel Yukari's affection.
It seems we've grown closer...

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Geez, it's embarrassing to say that out loud! I'm gonna go cool my head for a bit!
Happy - Point is, you can lean on me as a friend from now on, okay?

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I-I'm gonna go now! Bye!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari ran off...
I decided to go back to the dorm.

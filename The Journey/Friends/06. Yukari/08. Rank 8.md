Yukari Takeba
Happy - Hey, mind if I go take a look at some earrings?
Happy - I've been wanting new ones, but I can never seem to make up my mind.
Happy - They're all so cute, y'know? There are too many options to choose from!

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I know! Why don't you come help me pick something out, Arisato-kun?

Minato Arisato - Selection
All right.
I'm too lazy.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Yeah! C'mon then, let's go!

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Oh c'mon, don't be such a spoilsport.
Exasperated* - ...Well, I guess I'm used to it.

Yukari Takeba
Hang on, I've got a call.

Yukari Takeba
Hello?
Sad - ...!
Sad - Uh-huh...

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - What!? You're not doing it!?
Sad - You want my approval first...?
Sad - Wait! It's fine! You can do what you wanna do!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Uh, what I mean is...
Sad - If that's what you really want, then go ahead. It's your choice, so...
Sad - You really don't have to worry about me.

Yukari Takeba
Looking away - Well, then...
Looking away - Do you want to meet up and talk about it?
Looking away - ......

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Hey, s-stop it, don't cry!
Sad - I'll try to call you more too, okay?
Sad - ...All right. Bye.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - ......
Sad - That was my mom.
Sad - She apologized for everything that's happened.
Sad - She said she won't get remarried until I'm okay with it...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - That's weird... I can't stop shaking for some reason.
Sad - Can we sit for a while?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I sat with Yukari until she calmed down...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Sorry about all that. I'm fine now.
Sad - I was just surprised...
Sad - I never expected this to happen.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I told her we could meet up and talk about her remarriage. I'm nervous just thinking about it...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Will you let her do it?
Do you want to see her?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Well... I don't know.
Sad - To tell you the truth, I don't think it should be about me "letting" her or not.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I don't exactly want to... I'm afraid it might get ugly.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - We haven't seen each other in almost ten years, so it's... not going to be easy.
Sad - I'm afraid I'll get angry and say something cruel.

Yukari Takeba
Still... I think it's time I try talking to her.
I've been saying how wrong it is to run away, so I need to live up to my own advice.

Yukari Takeba
You know, I think she still misses my dad, deep down.
Sad - But she couldn't handle it... Losing someone so important to her...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - That's why she needed someone to lean on.
Sad - I think... losing someone you love and having to go on alone is really, really hard.
Sad - I'm not sure how to explain, but I realized this after being with you, Arisato-kun.

Yukari Takeba
I think being in love means giving a part of yourself away...
Happy - And that's a wonderful thing...
Happy - ......

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - I mean, just in general, you know!?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari's feelings are coming out...
It seems we've grown closer...

Yukari Takeba
I'm not sure how to explain, but...
I realized this after spending time with you and the others from the dorm.
There are a lot of people who support me. And that's a wonderful thing...

Yukari Takeba
But my mom didn't have anyone like that. So all she could do was cling on to whoever she could...
I think... losing someone you love and having to go on alone is really, really hard.
But I still think it's wrong to jump into relationships for a reason like that.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari is trusting in me...
It seems we've grown closer...

Yukari Takeba
The earrings can wait till next time.
Let's just go home for today.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I decided to go back to the dorm...

Happy - Mmm, this is so good! I made the right choice getting the same thing as you, Arisato-kun.

Yukari Takeba
Oh, I was just thinking! Doesn't eating fish remind you of the ocean?
It's a part of our lives, I guess, living along the coast. We even spent our vacation at the beach.
Happy - Hey, after all this is over, why don't we go somewhere different, like the mountains?
Happy - We could have lunch outdoors. Maybe we'll even see a deer or something. What do you think?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sounds good.
Let's go with everyone.
Let's go just the two of us.
No thanks.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Right?

Yukari Takeba
Happy - All right, then. I'll make us lunch!
Happy - I might not look like it, but I'm a pretty good cook! Just you wait and see!

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Hmm, yeah, why not, right? It'll be like a reward for everyone's hard work.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - All right, then. I'll make us lunch!
Happy - I might not look like it, but I'm a pretty good cook! Just you wait and see!

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Hold on, what's this all of a sudden!?
Surprised - Just the two of us...? I-I didn't mean it like that.
Surprised - I mean, it's not that I don't want to! It's just... I'm not ready yet.
Surprised - Oh god, what am I saying!?

Yukari Takeba
Either way, um... I'm sure it'd be fun to hang out somewhere together. I could even make food for us!
Happy - I might not look like it, but I'm a pretty good cook! Just you wait and see!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Huh? Why not?

Yukari Takeba
If you're worried about the lunch, I've got it covered!
Happy - I might not look like it, but I'm a pretty good cook! Just you wait and see!

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Hehe, it's been a while since we've talked about going on vacation. I'm excited just thinking about it!
I'm not sure how to say this, but... when I'm with you, Arisato-kun...
I don't feel so alone.

Yukari Takeba
I mean, I do have friends... And there's everybody at the dorm, but...
Sad - Usually, I feel like the real me is trapped somewhere deep down inside.
Sad - Maybe it's because of my family situation, but... I'm always pushing people away without realizing it.

Yukari Takeba
Lately, though, that's been changing.
Happy - And I think it's thanks to you, Arisato.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari is trusting in me.
It seems we've grown closer...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Well, that was delicious. It's getting late.
Happy - Shall we head out?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I decided to go back to the dorm...

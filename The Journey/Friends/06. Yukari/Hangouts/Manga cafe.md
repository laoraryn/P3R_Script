Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Wow, it's already getting dark out...
Happy - I didn't realize we were in there so long.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Have you ever noticed just how many manga are about high schoolers who get thrown into some kind of battle?
I didn't think about it until now, but... I guess we're just like that now...

Yukari Takeba
But, no one knows about us, huh... Just like a manga.

Minato Arisato - Selection
You look like a hero.
Probably not.
Some people do.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - What's that s'posed to mean?
Is it because I'm in the archery club?

Yukari Takeba
Angry - I mean... Sure, my arms are pretty strong...
Angry - ...But I'm not showing that off or anything!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari seems mad.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - R-Right. I'm thinking too much, huh...
Happy - I guess I'll just have to think of it as our secret?
Happy - A secret, huh...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari seems rather happy.
I learned a little more about her today.

Yukari Takeba
Like who...?
Happy - Oh, you mean like Officer Kurosawa?
That reminds me... I hate to say this, especially since he's been helping us, but...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Don't you think he's kinda scary-looking? Especially his eyes. Don't tell anyone I said that, though.
Sad - Well, it's nice to know that at least someone appreciates what we've been doing.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari and I were able to understand
each other a little more.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Oww... My back's kinda stiff from being in the same position for so long...
Happy - Let's stretch our limbs a little before going back. Whaddaya say?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We walked around together for a
while before returning to the dorm.

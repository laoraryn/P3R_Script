Yukari Takeba
Very happy* - Mmmm... That was sooo good!
Happy - Nothing beats azuki strawberry daifuku!

Yukari Takeba
So, I have a question for you...

Yukari Takeba
Do YOU like azuki strawberry daifuku?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Not really.
I love it.
Never tried it.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Wha—!? But, it's so good!
Happy - I guess everybody's tastes are different. Maybe you'll change your mind if you try it a second time?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari seems to be having fun.
I learned a little more about her today.

Yukari Takeba
Very happy* - Right!? The pink outer skin is cute, isn't it?
I mean, can you really call it a strawberry rice cake if the skin isn't pink?
Happy - I wonder if our tastes outside of food are the same as well...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari seems excited...
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Not even once!? That's crazy.
Sad - I think you're the first person I've ever met who's never tried it...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari seems a bit uneasy...
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - What do you wanna do now? We already ate, so should we just walk around for a bit?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I walked around with Yukari for a
while before returning to the dorm.

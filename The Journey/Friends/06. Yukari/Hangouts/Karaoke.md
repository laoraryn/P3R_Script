Yukari Takeba   
Very happy* - Whew, what a concert! It feels good to sing as loud as you can, doesn't it?   
Happy - Plus, your song choices were pretty unique, Arisato-kun.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Oh, speaking of music, what do you usually listen to?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Western music.   
J-pop.   
Nothin'...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very happy* - Oh, I kinda thought so! You look like you'd be into that kind of music.   
Happy - I'm not really familiar with Western music, so let me know if you have any recs!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I'm trying to broaden my horizons, you know?   
Happy - It'd be a waste to miss out on good music just because it's in a different language.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari seems happy.   
I learned a little more about her today.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Wait, really!? Me too!   
Happy - Hey, who's your favorite band? These days, I've been super into this one that did a song for a popular drama.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Oops, I'm sorry! I got a little too excited about it...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari is flustered.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Huh? But you've always got headphones on...   
Sad - ...Never mind, it's all right if you don't wanna say.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari is sighing...   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Oh, I just remembered I ran out of hand powder.   
It's something we use for archery. I'm gonna go buy some, so you should head back first.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I saw Yukari off, then returned to the dorm...

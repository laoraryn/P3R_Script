The "Willpower!" series...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I was planning on seeing this with a friend from my club... I thought it might help motivate us.
Exasperated* - You might think it's kinda cheesy, though... Now I'm not so sure about this...

Sports Club Coach
Come on, show me some guts! Push your limits! You swore you'd take us to nationals!

Sports Club Coach
And then the big leagues, the World Series, and then the Olympics! That was our promise!

Sports Club Member
I'll never forget! I'm gonna make it! I won't stop running till I reach the sunset!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Hot-blooded sweat is
flying across the screen.
I learned that with enough willpower,
you can overcome anything...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - That was awesome! We were in there for a while, but it went by so fast!

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I guess there really are times in life where you gotta push yourself through with sheer willpower.
Happy - But I'm still young... I haven't really done anything that crazy just yet.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Oh wow, it's getting late. How many movies did we watch?
We saw the baseball one, the judo one, the boot camp one... Oh right, even shot put!

Yukari Takeba
The shot put stuff kinda lost me, but the scenes after that with the main guy running were so good.
Happy - I cried my eyes out when he did the hundred handstands into the sunset!

Yukari Takeba
......

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I'm being weird, huh?

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Anyway, I'm getting hungry. Why don't we grab a bite somewhere before heading back?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I decided to go back to
the dorm with Yukari.

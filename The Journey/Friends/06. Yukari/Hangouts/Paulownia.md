Yukari Takeba
Maybe I should go shopping after this...
Happy - Y'know, since I have someone to carry my bags for me and all... Hehe.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Just kidding!
But for real, it's obvious how much stronger you are than me...

Yukari Takeba
You'd pick up stuff that I'm struggling to carry like it's nothing.
Since my dad wasn't around much when I was little, it was tough to go shopping on my own.

Yukari Takeba
By the way...

Yukari Takeba
I want to ask you something...
Sad - Is it weird for me to be so hung up about my parents at my age?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Not really.
A little.
Leave the bags to me.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - ...I see.
Happy - I'm glad to hear that.
Happy - Sorry for the weird question. Just forget I brought it up, 'kay?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari is smiling.
I learned a little more about her today.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Oh...
Sad - That's what I was worried about...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Oh, don't worry about me. I'm the one who asked in the first place.

Yukari Takeba
Well, you know... I never had a "normal" family...
Sad - So sometimes I worry too much about being different from those around me

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari seems a little sad.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Hey! What kind of answer is that!?

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Haha, but thanks for the offer.
Happy - That's one of the things I like about you, Arisato-kun.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari seems happy.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Yukari Takeba
Very happy* - It's nice to relax and do whatever we want every now and then, huh?
Very happy* - All right, let's get going on this shopping spree!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After shopping with Yukari,
I decided to go back to the dorm.

Happy - Wow, so this is what this place is like.
Happy - I never had the chance to actually look around. They have all kinds of stuff, huh?

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Is this a magazine clipping?
Happy - "Cleanse your soul." "Let's get purified with charmstones!"
Happy - ...Wow, that's a fun way to advertise themselves.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Oh, look, something's written on the wall.
Let's see here... "Choose your favorite color."
"It will reflect your state of mind." Hm...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - What's your favorite color, Arisato-kun?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Blue.
Black.
Green.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Ah, figures. Yeah, I think that really suits you.

Yukari Takeba
Let's see... "People who chose blue"...
..."are holy. They take infinite joy in the end of days."
Happy - That's... interesting, but doesn't seem realistic...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari seems to be having fun.
I learned a little more about her today.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Wow, what a modest choice. Well, I guess that's typical for boys.

Yukari Takeba
Let's see... "People who chose black"...
..."accept the truth. They are lucky to one day reach enlightenment."
Sad - That's... interesting, but doesn't seem realistic...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari is thinking hard...
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Ooh, I like that color too. I wonder if it's true what they say about it being good for your eyes.

Yukari Takeba
Let's see here... "People who chose green"...
..."serve others on their wings. They are harvesters."
Happy - That's... interesting, but doesn't seem realistic...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari and I look at each other and shrug...
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Yukari Takeba
I don't know much about spiritual stuff, but I can see how people find it soothing.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Oh, look, this one is sooo cute! The price... not so much.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After browsing the store together,
we decided to return to the dorm.

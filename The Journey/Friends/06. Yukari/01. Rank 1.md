Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Hey, so, um...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Ugh, never mind! Just forget about it!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - ...I guess saying that only makes you more curious, huh?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It does...   
Not really.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Yeah, I'm not surprised. Sorry about that.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Uh... Well, in a way that makes it easier to talk about.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - So, you might have forgotten all about this... and it's totally fine if you did!   
Sad - But, when we were at Yakushima... I said some stupid things.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - And... I just wanted to say I'm sorry.   
Sad - It's been on my mind this whole time.   
Looking away - ......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You know, I always felt like I wanted to just... be normal.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I wanted to have a family like all the other kids. A mom and dad to come home to...   
Sad - ......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - Why do we have to be different...?   
Looking away - Why us?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Oh, sorry! I didn't mean to lump the two of us together.   
But... I feel like you understand, and have been looking out for me, Arisato-kun.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - At least, that's what I think.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Haha. Is that just wishful thinking?   
That's how I really feel, though.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari is opening up to me.   
It seems the two of us have   
gotten a little closer...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - It's getting cold... Let's go home.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I decided to go back to the dorm.

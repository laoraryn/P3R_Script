Happy - Shall we get going, Arisato-kun?   
We don't have all night, y'know. There's still a curfew!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Hey, let's go to Paulownia Mall!   
Happy - I hear they're gonna have lights up. Everything must feel so different under that kind of atmosphere.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - To be honest, I've been looking forward to it...

I decided to spend   
Christmas Eve with Yukari...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Aww, it's so pretty! This is wonderful...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's beautiful.   
What next?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Yeah... I could look at this all night long.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - Come on... You're ruining the mood.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Did you know they brought in a famous designer for these decorations?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Here, I have a present for you.   
Happy - It's been a while since I've made something like this.

I hope it tastes all right.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Honestly, when I first met you...   
I never thought we'd end up spending Christmas together like this.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I was just so used to being all on my own.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I'm only gonna tell you this because it's a special day, but...   
I actually always dreamed of doing something like this.   
Sad - ......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - I know that with everything going on, it's not exactly the time to be getting all warm and fuzzy...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - But... one night couldn't hurt, right?   
Just for today... I want to be by your side.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I shared a tender moment with Yukari.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Shoot, look at the time...   
Sad - ......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Well, I'm sure it's fine. We can't be the only ones staying out late on a day like this, right?   
Happy - Except for Junpei, I guess. I can't imagine him having a romantic evening out.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Er— Sorry, that isn't the point.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I just... want to stay with you a little longer.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - ......   
H-Hey, are you cold? I-It's chilly, right?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - ......   
Sad - Can I... come closer?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - ......   
Happy - I was... hoping you could keep me warm, maybe?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I spent time with Yukari until night fell.

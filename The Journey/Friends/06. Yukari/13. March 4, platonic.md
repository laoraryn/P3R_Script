Yukari Takeba - MSG_000_0_0   
Surprised - Oh! Arisato-kun!?   
Oh, sorry. I was just thinking about you...   
Uh...   
......   
Sad - Can we go somewhere else?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
All right.   
Why?   
   
Yukari Takeba - MSG_002_0_0   
Thanks...   
Sad - Uh... You look like you're not feeling well. Sorry to bother you at a time like this, but I appreciate it.   
   
Yukari Takeba - MSG_003_0_0   
Sad - I dunno, sorry...   
Sad - You look like you could use some rest anyway... Don't worry about it.   
I'll see you later, then...   
   
-----   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - H-Hey, sorry for calling you out here...   
Sad - I... actually have a little favor to ask.   
Looking away - Um...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - I-It's about my mom!   
Angry - I... want you to meet her.   
Sad - ......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - I mean, not in a weird way!   
Sad - It's just that... I promised to meet up with her, but I'm still kind of scared.   
Sad - If I see her... I might end up saying some really nasty things...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - What if we end up hurting each other even more? I'm not trying to make her feel bad...   
Sad - I haven't fully sorted out my feelings yet.   
Sad - But I do want to see her... I think.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
That's why I thought it'd be great if you could be there with me, Arisato-kun.   
Sad - You don't have to say anything, really...   
Sad - It's just that I'd feel more confident having you around.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - With you by my side, I think I could treat my mom with a little more kindness.   
Sad - So, if it's not too much trouble... What do you think?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure.   
That's a bit much.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very happy* - You'll do it!? Thank you!   
Very happy* - Okay, I'll call her up right away! I've been putting this off for so long...   
Sad - Sorry to wrap you up in my family situation.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - O-Of course, yeah!   
Sad - I mean, meeting anyone's parents is already awkward... Mine would be ten times worse!   
Exasperated* - That's for sure...   
Looking away - ......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - In any case, um... it won't be right away. Besides, I still haven't gathered the confidence myself...   
Sad - I'll just ask her when she's free. And if you don't have plans that day... Well, think about it, okay?   
Sad - ......   
Sad - It really would make me happy if you came along.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Hey, um...   
Sad - You don't think I'm relying on you too much, do you?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I do.   
Not at all.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Whoa, you are brutally honest!   
Happy - In that case, it's only fair for me to help you out when you need it too, okay?   
Happy - Then we'll call it even!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I knew you'd say that.   
But still, this isn't a one-way street! Let me know whenever you need help too, okay?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You know, it's almost spring break.   
It all went by so fast... We're gonna be third-years soon.   
And after that, we'll graduate and go to college... then become working adults, I guess?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Wow, it's hard to imagine...   
Do you think... we'll still be together at that point?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Of course.   
Who knows...?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Yeah...   
Happy - I think so, too.   
Happy - ......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - There you go again...   
I get what you mean, though. It's hard to say what things will be like so far into the future.   
I wonder what'll happen to us...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Well, let's talk about the near future, then.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I told you to think about where you wanna go, remember?   
Happy - I still think the best place to start is Destinyland.   
Happy - It's just a day trip, so that makes planning easy. And it's perfect for bigger groups, too!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very happy* - Oh! But if we decide on the mountains, we should stay the night. If we're gonna travel far, might as well make the most of it.   
Very happy* - Hehe, I'm getting excited just thinking about it!   
Happy - With you, Arisato-kun, it'll be fun no matter where we go.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Oh, crap! I totally forgot to turn in today's assignment. I'd better go do that now!   
Happy - Let's talk about this again soon!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very happy* - Don't forget to save some time during spring break, okay?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I spent time playing with Maiko.   
   
Maiko   
Happy - Hey, hey! What do you wanna do next?   
Happy - It's your turn, okay? You get to pick!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
See-saw.   
Jungle gym.   
Monkey bars.   
I wanna go home.   
   
Maiko   
Angry - Aww, I hate the see-saw! It makes my butt hurt...   
   
Maiko   
Happy - Oh, yay! I love climbing on top of stuff!   
   
Maiko   
Angry - We did that already! I wanna do something different!   
   
Maiko   
Angry - Aww, you're leaving already?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It looks like it'll be getting dark soon...   
   
Maiko   
Angry - I don't wanna go home...   
Angry - I don't like it there.   
   
Maiko   
Can we stay here a little longer?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
After playing together, she seems   
to have taken a liking to me...   
I've become acquainted with   
Maiko, the grade-schooler.   
   
Maiko   
Angry - You know, my mom and dad...   
Angry - All they ever do is fight. And... just the other day...   
   
Maiko   
Angry - They said they were getting a divorce.   
Angry - I told them not to, but they won't listen.   
Angry - They probably don't care about me.   
Angry - ......   
   
Maiko   
Hey... You'll play with me again later, right? We're friends now!   
I'm here on **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays**... You have to come see me, okay?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I parted ways with Maiko,   
then went back to the dorm.

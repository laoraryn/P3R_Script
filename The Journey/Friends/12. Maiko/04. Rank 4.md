Maiko
So, you know how it was my birthday the other day?
Happy - Well, guess what! Mom and Dad both remembered!
Happy - They really do care about me!

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's great news.
Of course they care.
Nah, they don't care.

Maiko
Happy - Yeah! They were smiling and happy and everything!

Maiko
Happy - Yeah, you're right!

Maiko
Angry - Hey! That's not true!

Maiko
Happy - I got so many presents! I even got a birthday cake!
It's been so long since we ate together as a family.
Angry - We used to do it all the time...
Angry - How come Mom and Dad don't get along anymore?

Maiko
I know! I'll just ask them why!
If I know why, I can fix it and make it all better!
I'm gonna make Mom and Dad happy again!
Happy - Wish me luck, okay?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Maiko seems fond of me...
I feel like we're growing closer...

Maiko
Okay... I'm gonna ask them.
Happy - Bye-bye! Let's play again later, okay?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After saying goodbye to Maiko,
I headed back to the dorm.

Maiko   
Happy - Hey c'mon! Let's play on the jungle gym!   
Happy - Then the see-saw, and then kick the can, and then, and then...! Let's play everything!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I passed the time playing with Maiko.   
   
Maiko   
Happy - Whew... I'm tired.   
Happy - No way you'll forget about me now, right? We played so much!   
......   
   
Maiko   
Today... I'm moving far away.   
   
Maiko   
Um... Dad told me I would always be his daughter.   
No matter how far away, we're still family...   
So I don't have to be sad!   
   
Maiko   
Family is special...   
Do you think I'll have a family of my own one day?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'm sure you will.   
No idea.   
   
Maiko   
Yeah, you're right! I hope...   
   
Maiko   
Angry - Hey, don't tease me!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Maiko seems mad.   
   
Maiko   
So, um...   
When I'm all grown up...   
Can we get married?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure.   
I'll think about it.   
   
Maiko   
Happy - Really!? You promise!?   
   
Maiko   
Angry - No! You're supposed to say yes! I don't wanna marry anyone else...   
   
Maiko   
Take this, okay...? I made it just for you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
UNUSED. If you see this, it's a bug.   
   
Maiko   
Happy - Someday, let's get real wedding rings!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Maiko is blushing...   
Apparently, she just proposed to me...   
   
SYS_017_0_0   
The Hanged Man Social Link reached its maximum level! You can now fuse **Attis**, the god of sacrifice!   
   
Maiko   
Close your eyes, okay?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
...!?   
I felt a kiss on my cheek...   
   
Maiko   
Happy - Hehehe! Don't be so shy!   
Well... bye-bye.   
Happy - We'll see each other again, okay? I just know it!

Hm? You're...
Ah, Arisato-kun, right?
I'm... Maiko's father, if you remember.

Maiko's Dad - MSG_001_0_0
Do you have a minute to talk? I've been dwelling a little on what happened...

Minato Arisato - Selection
All right.
I'm a bit busy today...

Maiko's Dad - MSG_003_0_0
Perfect. If you don't mind, let's take a walk down to the takoyaki stand. I'll buy you some—my treat.
The food there sure is good... But you knew that already, didn't you?

Maiko's Dad - MSG_004_0_0
Oh. That's too bad...
I was just thinking of Maiko when you happened to show up.
Sorry for imposing.

Maiko's Dad
When I see this place, I remember all the times I'd come here with Maiko...
She came here when she ran away from home, too.

Maiko's Dad
She really loved the takoyaki...

Maiko's Dad
She's a good girl, wouldn't you agree?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah...
Was she?

Maiko's Dad
She's so good that I wonder if she's really my own child sometimes.

Maiko's Dad
Oh... Were you not that close? Well, I thought I'd at least let you know.

Maiko's Dad
She actually sent me a letter recently.
It's chock-full of details about her new life.

Maiko's Dad
She said she's made a lot of friends.
Let's see... She's in charge of the rabbits at her new school, and has had to get up early to clean the cages.
They scolded her for forgetting her P.E. uniform... She forgot her homework and had to copy a friend's...

Maiko's Dad
I guess she can be a bit absentminded. I never knew that about her...
Oh, and she did so well on her recorder test that she was asked to perform in front of everyone.

Maiko's Dad
Then she went on to talk about how she plays at the park by the school with her friends every day...
Her mother's doing well, too. They're having a lot of fun together.

Maiko's Dad
......
Having fun... Must be nice.
Nowadays, I just come home to an empty house... The rooms feel so big without those two around.

Maiko's Dad
I wonder if she feels the same way, living in a home with no father in it.
We put her through so much because of our own problems...
I feel terrible about it.

Maiko's Dad
By the way... I've actually got a bone to pick with you too!
Maiko must have really liked you, huh? She wrote all about it.

Maiko's Letter
"I can't wait to grow up!"
"That's why I'm drinking lots of milk."
"I'm going to marry him someday!"

Maiko's Dad
...
......
.........

Maiko's Dad
What the hell is that about, you little punk!?

Maiko's Dad
Y-You were taking advantage of my little Maiko, weren't you!?
Maybe I haven't been the best dad, b-but I'm still her father, dammit!
And I'm not letting a guy like you touch my daughter with a ten-foot pole!

Maiko's Dad
I-I'll never let you marry her! And don't you forget it!

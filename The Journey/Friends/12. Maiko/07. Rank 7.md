Maiko
Angry - Thank you for always helping me... But I gotta say bye for now.
Sad - Yup, I have to run away now.

Maiko
Remember not to tell Mom and Dad, okay? Bye-bye!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
...?

Woman
Hey, you!
Have you seen a little girl? She's in elementary school...

Man
Will you just take a second and calm down?

Woman
Calm down!? What if something happens to her!?

Man
Oh please! This is what happens when you force a child to study non-stop!

(SE) Woman
Why are you always like this!? Everything has to be MY fault!

(SE) Man
That's because it IS your fault! This never would have happened if you'd been watching her!

Man
Look, we don't have time for this!
I think I know who you are. Arisato-kun, right? Maiko's told me about you.
She said she played with a high school kid instead of practicing piano.

Woman
What!? This is the first I'm hearing of this!
What the hell did you do to my daughter!?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The woman is extremely agitated...

Man
Shut up! Stop jumping to stupid conclusions.

Man
I'm sorry about this... We're Maiko's parents.

Maiko's Dad
We haven't seen her since this morning.
When we checked her room, we found a note that said, "I'm running away."

Maiko's Mom
She's never done anything like this before!

Minato Arisato - Selection
We should look for her.
It's probably your fault.
Just leave her alone.

Maiko's Dad
R-Right. She might be around here somewhere.

Maiko's Mom
Excuse me!? You don't know anything!

Maiko's Mom
Don't be stupid! What if something happens to her out there!?

Maiko's Mom
Maiko... Why...?

Maiko's Dad
Listen...
If you have any idea where she is, I'm begging you to tell us.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Maybe the music store.
Maybe the takoyaki stand.

Maiko's Dad
The music store...? Why would she have gone there?
Well, let's try looking!

Maiko's Dad
Takoyaki stand? Oh, that place!
Right, let's try looking!

===============================================================================================

Maiko's Mom
*huff* *huff* What's going on? She's not here!

Maiko's Dad
Where else would she go...?
Wait... Maybe she went to get takoyaki!
She must be hungry by now, right? Takoyaki is her favorite!
Let's go!

===============================================================================================

Maiko's Mom
Maiko!

Maiko
Mom!

Maiko
Dad... And you too...
Sad - Well, I... Um... I...

Maiko's Mom
Maiko, are you okay? You're not hurt anywhere?

Maiko
Sad - I-I'm okay...

Maiko's Mom
Oh, thank goodness...
Why would you do such a thing!? I was worried sick!
Do you think that's funny, giving me a heart attack like that!?

Maiko's Dad
Hey, that's enough...

Maiko
Crying - Um... You made me worry too! I was so scared...
Crying - You said you were getting a divorce, and I didn't know what to do!

Maiko
Crying - I... I don't want you to get divorced!
Crying - Waaaaaaaaaaaah!

Maiko's Dad
Oh, so that's what this is all about...
We're really sorry, Maiko... Why don't we go home and talk about it?

Maiko's Dad
It's awful we pulled you into this... I'm not sure what else to say...

Maiko
Sad - Hey... I told you to keep it a secret...
Sad - But... thank you...

Internal MES - MND_010_0_0
Maiko seems relieved to see
that her parents care about her.
I feel like we're growing closer...

Maiko
Sad - Um... Bye-bye...

Internal MES - MND_012_0_0
Maiko went home with her parents,
so I decided to go back to the dorm.

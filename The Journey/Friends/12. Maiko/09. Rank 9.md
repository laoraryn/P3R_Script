Maiko   
Hey, I know! Let's get some takoyaki!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Maiko   
So... I think I know now.   
I'm gonna go with Mom.   
She can't cook or clean or do anything on her own.   
   
Maiko   
Happy - So I'm gonna be there to help her!   
I think Dad's gonna be okay by himself.   
He can get along fine without me.   
   
Maiko   
So, um... Mom and I are gonna move away soon.   
Sad - ......   
   
Maiko   
Sad - Hey...   
Sad - Even if I'm gone... we'll still be friends, right?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Friends forever.   
I might forget about you.   
   
Maiko   
Mhm...   
Friends forever! Forever and ever and ever, okay?   
   
Maiko   
Sad - Nooo! You have to remember me...   
   
Maiko   
You can't forget about me. Never, ever! Okay?

Maiko seems very fond of me...   
I feel like we're growing closer...   
   
Maiko   
I gotta get ready to move, so I have to go home now.   
See you later, okay?

After saying goodbye to Maiko,   
I headed back to the dorm.

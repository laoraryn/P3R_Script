Hurt - M-My side is killing me... I might've overdone it a bit.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Don't push yourself.   
Toughen up!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Hurt - I'm not giving up yet. I can keep going.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Easy for you to say... But honestly, you're probably onto something.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
How 'bout you? You okay? You've really been pushing it.   
You don't even look tired... Uh, what kind of training regimen do you have?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Just a normal routine.   
A very special routine.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
You say that like it's no big deal. Meanwhile I'm dying over here.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
I figured as much. Else I wouldn't be dying over here...   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
You're pretty crazy, Arisato.   
It kinda sucks... You totally destroyed me.   
I knew the standards were high around here, but I never thought someone so good would be right in front of me.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Angry - Okay, I've made up my mind!   
Angry - Listen up, Arisato! I'm gonna make you eat my dust!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Looks like Miyamoto sees me as a rival.   
I feel like we're becoming closer...

Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sorry, I didn't mean to get so worked up.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Hurt - Let's get go— Argh!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What's wrong?   
Come on, hurry up.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Hurt - I think I might've... twisted my knee.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Ah, forget it. Let's go.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I parted ways with Miyamoto   
and went back to the dorm.

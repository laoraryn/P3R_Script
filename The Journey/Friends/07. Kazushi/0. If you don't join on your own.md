Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
The track team is training hard.

===============================================================================================

Ms. Toriumi
Arisato-kun, I have a favor to ask of you.
It's about our track and field team. They don't have enough members, unfortunately.
Sad - The coach came crying to me about how they can't carry on like this!

Ms. Toriumi
Sad - Please! Do your teacher a favor, would you?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Ms. Toriumi looks pretty desperate...
I get the feeling she won't
let me leave unless I say yes.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Okay, I'll join the track team.
I really don't want to...

Ms. Toriumi
Surprised - Really!? You'll do it!?
Happy - Thank you! Yes! Just scored me a free lunch!
Ah, forget that last part.
Happy - Okay then, don't forget to turn in your membership application after school!

Ms. Toriumi
Angry - Sorry, can't hear you.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I ended up joining the
track and field team.
Looks like I have no choice, so I'll
go to the field after school today.

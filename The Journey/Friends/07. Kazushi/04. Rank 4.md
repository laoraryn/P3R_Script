Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I don't see Miyamoto...

Well, we're outta here.   
   
Second-Year Club Member   
Take it easy!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Good hustle out there!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - You'd better wrap up too, Arisato-kun. See you next practice!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I started on my way back   
to the dorm after practice.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Surprised - Whoa! Arisato!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Wh-What's up? I was just gonna sneak back into practice.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Where have you been?   
Did you ditch?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - M-My mom's been on my case!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - She took me to the hospital. She insisted after I told her about my knee.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Angry - No way! I had a legit reason!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - I was at the hospital. My mom insisted. I shouldn't have told her about my knee.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
She made the appointment without telling me, so there was nothing I could do!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
How did it go?   
That really sucks.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Angry - Hell if I know.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Ah, sorry, I know you're just worried about me.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - You said it. I don't get why my mom and the rest of the team are acting like this.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - It's exhausting having everyone up in your business!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Today, they took some X-rays. They'll give me the results in a few days.   
Not sure why that has to take so long...   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Oh, hey! Don't tell anyone about me going to the hospital, alright?   
Sad - I'm counting on you, Arisato!   
Sad - I feel bad for always asking you to keep things quiet. Sorry 'bout that.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Miyamoto seems appreciative of me.   
I feel like we're becoming closer...   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Alright! The doctor told me to take it easy today, but we should still get to practice!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Oh, wait... If you're leaving, that means practice is already over.   
Sad - Well, I guess I'll just go home.   
Sad - See ya, Arisato.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I decided to go back to the dorm.

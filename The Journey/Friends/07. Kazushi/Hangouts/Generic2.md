Kazushi Miyamoto   
...I guess I kinda stand out like a sore thumb. Maybe I shouldn't have worn my track suit...   
Eh, I'll just think of it as part of my mental training.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
This is kind of a weird thing to bring up, but I actually, uh... How do I put it...?   
I crack under pressure. Like, I get really nervous and stuff. I've gotten a lot better lately though.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
The more I want to win, I can just feel myself tense up...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's a part of who you are.   
You can get through this.   
Winning isn't everything.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - But if you don't try to overcome your weakness... isn't that kinda like running away?   
Sad - You know how they say you gotta "run away to fight another day"? Yeah, that's not my style.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Miyamoto's mood has soured.   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Yeah, you're right! Whining won't get me through this—only mental strength will!   
Sad - ...Actually, I dunno, man. Maybe that won't be enough this time. What exactly am I missing...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Miyamoto is deep in thought.   
I learned a little more about him today.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
So, you're telling me not to think about it? I dunno if I can, man...   
Happy - But... I see where you're coming from. That's kinda deep.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Miyamoto seems impressed.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Wish they'd hurry and tell me what's up with my knee though... The suspense is killing me.   
Happy - I'm feeling pretty good today, so maybe I'll jog a bit on my way back home.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
After I saw Miyamoto off, I decided   
to head back to the dorm.

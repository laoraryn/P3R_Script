Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - Dude, my knee just keeps getting worse...

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - The stairs were killing my knee...

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - Man, why do I even bother anymore? What's the point of going through all this pain just to win...?

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's just who you are.
For your nephew.
Figure it out yourself.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Yeah... Yeah, you're right! I hate losing! Er, was the answer that simple?
Happy - Sorry for getting all whiny on you... That's not me. Thanks for the wake-up call. I'm good now!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Miyamoto looks grateful.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Y-Yeah! If I give up now, he might never find the courage to walk on his own two feet...
But I can barely deal with my own problems right now... Can I even help him with his?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Miyamoto seems lost in thought.
I learned a little more about him today.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - C'mon, dude, don't be like that... I couldn't figure out anything, so that's why I came to you.
Sad - We're friends... Right?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Miyamoto looks sad.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Kazushi Miyamoto
Guess all I've got now is my last resort: divine intervention.
After we finish eating, I'm gonna stop by the shrine. I'll make sure to toss in more coins than usual when praying.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After seeing Miyamoto off to the
shrine, I headed back to the dorm.

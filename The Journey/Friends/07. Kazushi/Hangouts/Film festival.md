A war movie, huh? Sounds pretty heavy. Alright, let's do this!   
   
Soldier A   
Don't you die, Ryan! You swore we'd go back home together! You swore!   
   
Soldier B   
Hey man, don't gimme that look. You know I... I can't live without your smile... bro...ther...   
   
Soldier A   
Ryan...? Ryan! Ryaaaaaaan!

......   
I feel braver after watching the   
fearless soldiers in that movie.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Angry - Dude, that was insane! I wish I had that kind of fire in me.   
Happy - Okay, I'll see you later!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I parted ways with Miyamoto   
and went back to the dorm.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Wouldn't it be funny if all my knee problems turned out to be growing pains?

Kazushi Miyamoto
But, honestly, I don't wanna get any bigger than I am right now. It's not like I'm gonna go into pro wrestling.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Oh, you can have my rice if you want... Here, take it.
I'm trying to cut down on carbs.

Minato Arisato - Selection
You prefer bread?
Are you on a diet?
Are you feeling sick?

Kazushi Miyamoto
What, you think I'm a bread guy just 'cause I don't want my rice?
Happy - Y'know, I honestly was not expecting you to say that. Didn't take you for a jokester.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Miyamoto seems to be having fun.
I learned a little more about him today.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Yeah. I gotta watch what I eat these days so I can build muscle mass.
I'll do whatever it takes to win the regionals... Remember, it's all about the mindset, Arisato.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Miyamoto has shown me his resolve.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - Dude, you think my dedication is that weak? Remember, I'm ready 24/7.
Sad - I always keep my body in perfect condition... 'Cept my knee right now, I guess.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Miyamoto looks a little sullen.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - Ugh, dammit... I really do want some rice. Just having it right in front of me is torture...
No, I gotta snap out of it. This is perfect mental training. Go ahead and eat it, Arisato!
C'mon, just shovel it down!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After finishing the meal under Miyamoto's
watch, I headed back to the dorm.

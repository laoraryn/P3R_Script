Kazushi Miyamoto
This is the only place I could think of where I wouldn't have to use the stairs.
Happy - But maybe I shouldn't have come here in my track suit, heheh...

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - Ever since everyone found out about my knee, they've been giving me a hand with things. It's nice and all, but...
Sad - I've been getting less and less practice in. These days, I can barely even walk...

Kazushi Miyamoto
Can I ask you something? And just give it to me straight...
With everything that's happening to me right now... do you really think I can still win the regionals next year?

Minato Arisato - Selection
It's all mental strength.
It's all up to you.
Sounds impossible.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Stop joking around. I'm being serious here...
Sad - I thought I told you to give it to me straight... C'mon, man.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Miyamoto has gone silent.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Kazushi Miyamoto
Yeah... You're right.
Sad - I know I talked big on toughin' it out... But it ain't that simple this time.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Miyamoto is deep in thought.
I learned a little more about him today.

Kazushi Miyamoto
...Yeah, figures. That's the logical answer. Becoming the national champion's no walk in the park.
Happy - Thanks for being honest though. I'm glad we had this talk.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Miyamoto looks grateful.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Kazushi Miyamoto
I'm gonna rest here for a little while so I don't strain my knee. You can head out without me.
Happy - I'll cover the check. Thanks for today, Arisato.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I parted with Miyamoto and
headed back to the dorm.

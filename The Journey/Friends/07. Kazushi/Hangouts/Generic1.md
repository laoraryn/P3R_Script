Kazushi Miyamoto
Surprised - Dang, dude... You sure know how to dress to impress.

Kazushi Miyamoto
I wanna get some new threads, but I don't have time for that now.
On the weekends, I just wear my track suits—helps me get my head in the game and all that.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Happy - That way, I'm ready to go 24/7, y'know? That's real dedication, man.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Impressive.
I don't really care.
You need to chill.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Happy - It's mental strength, man. That's what I'm all about.
Happy - Nobody out there can beat me! Well, in spirit. You're not half-bad though, I'll give you that.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Miyamoto seems to be having a lot of fun.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Happy - Heh, you think you're some kinda big shot now just 'cause you beat me once?
Happy - You better watch out, pal, 'cause next time you're goin' down! Er, once I'm in better condition...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Miyamoto seems to be having fun.
I learned a little more about him today.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - ...Yuko told me the exact same thing.
Sad - I thought she just didn't get the whole dedication thing... But if you're saying it, too, then maybe I'm coming off a little too strong?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Miyamoto seems a little depressed.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Kazushi Miyamoto
Happy - So, what's the plan? Should we just walk around and find a place to eat?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We walked around the strip mall for a little
while before I had to head back to the dorm.

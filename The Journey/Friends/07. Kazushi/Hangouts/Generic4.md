Sad - I'm not one for taking days off from practice. That's BS.
Sad - That's why nobody on the team can know about my knee...

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - I've been doing track since middle school, and they're telling me to stop now?

Kazushi Miyamoto
Dude, at this rate, I'm gonna end up like one of those freaks on the news...
You know, that Apathy Syndrome thing.

Minato Arisato - Selection
I doubt it.
That's worrying.
Hang in there.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - Well, gee, thanks for your "concern," man.
Sad - I'll have you know, I'm not as tough as I look.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Miyamoto seems offended by what I said.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Kazushi Miyamoto
Happy - I-I was just kidding, man... I'm fine, promise! I'll show up to practice and everything.
Happy - I'm sure I can hide my knee injury... somehow. Thanks for looking out for me.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Miyamoto seems to be happy.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - Yep, just gotta make sure to keep my cool even if my knee starts hurting... Can't have the team find out and all.
Sad - I can't even imagine NOT going to practice after school. I have to power through this somehow.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Miyamoto looks grim.
I learned a little more about him today.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Well, gotta get my fill of nutrients if I wanna recover.
We athletes gotta take care of ourselves when we're not on the track!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After enjoying a meal together,
I headed back to the dorm.

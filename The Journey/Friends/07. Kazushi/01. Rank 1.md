Track Team Advisor
...So, starting today, he's an official member of the team.

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'm Minato Arisato.
Nice to meet you.

Female Student in a Jersey
Welcome aboard, Arisato-kun. I'm Yuko Nishiwaki.

Track Team Advisor
She's our team manager. She'll answer any of your questions.

Yuko Nishiwaki
You're a second-year, right? Since we're in the same grade, you can just call me "Yuko."

Track Team Advisor
Let's see... Hey! Miyamoto!

Miyamoto
Yes!

Track Team Advisor
This here's our future team captain. He's a great runner and places well in competitions.
You two are in the same class, right? Miyamoto, keep an eye on the new guy here, okay?

Miyamoto
You got it.

Miyamoto
You're the guy who went out with Takeba on the first day of school, right? You're practically a celebrity.
I'm Kazushi Miyamoto. You've seen me around, right?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah.
Nope.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Happy - Then long story short, from now on, you're mine after school.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - Ouch, man... Kinda hurts my pride. Everyone knows who I am.

Kazushi Miyamoto
You better not think you're getting the easy treatment just 'cause you joined mid-season!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Miyamoto's given me a warm welcome...
I joined the track team and made
friends with my new teammates.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Since this is your first practice, just have a look around and then call it a day.
We have practice on **Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays**. There's no practice the days before tests, though.
I'll make sure your uniform is ready for next time.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After looking around, I decided
to go back to the dorm.

Last one! Go for it!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I don't see Miyamoto today, either...
I started on my way back
to the dorm after practice.

===============================================================================================

Kazushi Miyamoto
Surprised - Wh-Whoa! Arisato!
Man... I keep running into you at the weirdest times.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Back from the hospital?
Did you ditch?

Kazushi Miyamoto
You remembered what we talked about last time? Nothing gets past you, eh?

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - No way. I'd never do that.

Kazushi Miyamoto
So, yeah... I just got back from the hospital.
They had the results from my last exam.
Sad - And well... Arisato, I...

Kazushi Miyamoto
Angry - Agh!

Kazushi Miyamoto
Angry - You gotta be kidding... Why can't I... stand up!?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Take my shoulder!
I'll carry you!
I'll go get help!

Kazushi Miyamoto
Ngh...
Happy - Thanks.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Surprised - Dude! What the hell!? I'm not a kid!
I appreciate the offer, though. Could I maybe just borrow your shoulder instead?

Kazushi Miyamoto
Angry - W-Wait! I don't want to cause a scene!
Sad - Please, it's fine. Could you maybe just lend me a shoulder?

Kazushi Miyamoto
Funny, huh? All from just crouching down to tie my shoes...
Sad - Good thing you were around. If it were anyone else, then the rest of the team would've found out.
Happy - Thanks, man. I'm really grateful to have you as a friend.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Miyamoto seems to really appreciate me.
I feel like we're becoming closer...

Kazushi Miyamoto
Happy - Alright, I'm gonna go train by myself.
Even if practice is over, I can't skip out on training. The big meet's not that far off.
Happy - You're heading home, right? Then we'll train together next time. Take it easy!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I parted ways with Miyamoto
and went back to the dorm.

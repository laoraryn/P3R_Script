Doesn't Miyamoto seem slower lately?   
   
Third-Year Club Member   
Yeah, he's not keeping his usual pace.   
   
Second-Year Club Member   
He thinks he'll make it to the nationals like that?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
If you guys have nothing better to do, then why don't you give me a hand with the laundry?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Angry - The only thing they're good at is kicking up dirt...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Hey, Kaz! Coach wants to see you in the office!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
'Kay! Be right there!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
......   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - Hey, Arisato-kun...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - ...Ah, never mind. I think we can wrap up practice for today.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I started on my way back   
to the dorm after practice.

Someone's Voice   
Hey, Arisato!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Let's walk home together.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - So, the coach told me my performance has been slipping.   
Sad - I know you didn't say anything. I just think he can tell something's up.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
How's your knee?   
Can you hide it?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
It's sore, sure, but I managed to make it through practice today.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - O-Oh, yeah! It's still sore, but, uh, I think can play it off like nothing's going on.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
He said I'd be suspended from the team if I'm hurt. But I told him I was fine.   
Angry - I've already missed practice three times this year! I'm gonna have to seriously step up my game!   
Angry - Otherwise, I won't be able to keep my promise to my nephew!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You have to get tougher!   
You can't win like this.   
You need to take a break...   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - You're right! In the end, it's the toughest one who wins!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - You're right. I've fallen way behind by missing practice, anyway.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
I know you mean well, but that's not an option for me.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
I've decided that I'll take my chances for my nephew's sake.   
...Even if I mess up my knee for the rest of my life.   
If that happens, I want you to be the next captain, Arisato.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Miyamoto opened up about his decision.   
I feel like we're becoming closer...   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
It's, uh, not exactly the happiest topic.   
B-But that's just the worst-case scenario!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Angry - I'm gonna keep my promise and win the meet, then the nationals! Then I'll take care of my knee!   
Angry - Nothing can stop me now!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I walked part of the way   
home with Miyamoto.

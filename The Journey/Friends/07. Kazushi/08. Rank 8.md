Miyamoto!

Kazushi Miyamoto
Wh-What is it? And what's with the scary look?

Track Team Advisor
What do you think you're doing!?

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - Just... practicing?

Track Team Advisor
Well that's enough practice for you. Get your butt to the nurse's office.
The rest of you, get back to it!

Second-Year Club Member
The nurse's office?

Third-Year Club Member
Miyamoto, did something happen?

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - ......

Yuko Nishiwaki
Angry - I knew it. He's such a bad liar. You can totally tell he's going easy on one knee.

Yuko Nishiwaki
I know you have something to do with this, Arisato-kun. Sorry, but you're coming, too.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I headed to the nurse's office with Yuko.

===============================================================================================

Track Team Advisor
I just had a call with your mom about your knee.

Mr. Edogawa
You're throwing caution to the wind, young man...

Kazushi Miyamoto
Angry - That blabbermouth!

Track Team Advisor
I want you to stop before things get any worse, you got that?

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - Please, don't do this to me... I need to practice.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - I heard, Kaz.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Yuko!? And Arisato, too!?

Yuko Nishiwaki
Take some time off, Kaz! Practice can wait till you're all better.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Angry - I can't! I don't have time!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Angry - Huh? What's the rush? Why do you do these things to yourself?

Track Team Advisor
Arisato, you've been hanging around with Miyamoto lately, right?
You must know what's going on.

Minato Arisato - Selection
I don't know anything.
......

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - Stop. Stop... I don't want you to lie for me.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - ......

Kazushi Miyamoto
W-Wait! Arisato has nothing to do with this!

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - I don't want you to get dragged into this, so I'll come clean.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Miyamoto is trying to protect me.
I feel like we're becoming closer...

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - So the truth is...

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - ...And that's the gist of it.
Angry - So I need to practice! I have to win, or else...

Track Team Advisor
I know how you feel, Miyamoto, but...

Kazushi Miyamoto
Angry - It all depends on me if my nephew ever walks again!

Someone's Voice
So that's what's going on.

Second-Year Club Member
I don't mind if he competes in the regionals.
It's just the individual competition, so we don't have to worry about him bringing us down.

Track Team Advisor
Hey, what happened to practice?

Third-Year Club Member
We were worried about Miyamoto.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - Guys...

Track Team Advisor
I'll let you keep training for now, and we'll see how things go.
But if I tell you to stop, I'm sorry. You're gonna have to listen.
And I want you to go home today. Your mother will be upset with me if I let you stay.

Kazushi Miyamoto
Sad - Sorry, Coach. Everyone, I...

Track Team Advisor
I think we're done here. The rest of you, back to training!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I finished training with everyone
and went back to the dorm.

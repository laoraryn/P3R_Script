Eager Student
Mochizuki-kun!

Lively Student
How was your first day after transferring? I hope you like it here, Mochizuki-kun.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - Oh, I do. And please, call me Ryoji.

Cheerful Student
Hey, do you have plans today? If not, maybe we can go somewhere for tea...?

Ms. Toriumi
Surprised - Oh, Mochizuki-kun.
Sorry to interrupt, but could you stop by the faculty office?
I'd like to give you a copy of the paperwork for your transfer.

Ms. Toriumi
Surprised - And, let's see...

Ms. Toriumi
Arisato-kun, could you come along too?

===============================================================================================

Ms. Toriumi
Go ahead and take that home with you. That should just about do it.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Thanks. Guess I'm done here, then.

Ryoji Mochizuki
See you tomorrow, Arisato-kun.

Ms. Toriumi
Sad - Ahh, sorry, hold on...

Ms. Toriumi
Could you two take these boxes over to the music room?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Why me?
All of them?

Ms. Toriumi
Surprised - Why...? Well, you happened to be around...
Sad - I think the boxes are packed full of sheet music. They're really heavy, so be careful not to hurt yourselves.

Ms. Toriumi
Yes. You know where the music room is, right?
Sad - I think the boxes are full of sheet music. They're really heavy, so be careful not to hurt yourselves.

Ms. Toriumi
Sad - I signed for these packages on behalf of the music club, but I can't keep them here forever...
Sad - That damn Ekoda— I mean, Mr. Ekoda has been talking my ear off, nagging me to get them out of here.

Ryoji Mochizuki
C'mon, we can't let the poor teacher carry all that herself. Let's help her out.

Ms. Toriumi
Happy - Ooh, now that's what I like to hear, Mochizuki-kun!
Happy - Why don't I bump both your Composition grades up a little? Joking, of course.

Ryoji Mochizuki
I wouldn't mind handling this by myself, but I did just transfer here...
Do you think you could show me the way to the music room?

===============================================================================================

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - Whew... I think that's all of it.
Happy - That was harder than I expected, but the teacher needed our help, right?

Ryoji Mochizuki
I gotta say, though...

Ryoji Mochizuki
You are stronger than you look, huh? Do you work out or something?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I have extracurricular activities.
It's a secret.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - Oh, are you on a sports team? Like baseball, or soccer? I think there's a track team too.
Happy - I'd like to join one too, but I guess they're not recruiting right now.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - Haha, come on, don't give me that.
Happy - Or is it really something you can't tell me? Well, I hope you can let me in on the secret someday.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Oh, that's right...

Ryoji Mochizuki
This caught my eye when we walked in.

Ryoji Mochizuki
I noticed you're always wearing headphones. I take it you're really into music?
Happy - How about I play you a song to break the ice between us? Sound good?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure.
You can play?
Not interested.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - Great. Then here goes...

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - Well, see for yourself.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - Oh, don't be like that. It would be such a wasted opportunity.

Ryoji Mochizuki
......

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - Haha, how was that? Any good?

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - I thought if I impressed you, it might be a good way for us to hit it off.

Ryoji Mochizuki
There's so much that I'm not comfortable or familiar with yet.
Happy - So I want to keep learning, and trying new things.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - I heard you transferred here too, back in spring.
Happy - Seems like we have a thing or two in common. Do you think we can be friends?
Happy - What do you say?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Nice to meet you.
We're already friends.
Try someone else.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - Likewise, and thanks.
Happy - Somehow, it already feels like we've known each other for a long time.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - Oh, haha, thanks.
Happy - It does somehow feel like we've known each other for a long time already.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Sad - Wow, that's harsh...
Well, whatever you say. We're classmates, so I'll be counting on you either way.

Ryoji Mochizuki
So, uh, what are we supposed to do in this situation?
Happy - Oh, right. I think we exchange phone numbers.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Sad - Er— Sorry... I don't have my phone right now.
Why don't you just give me your contact info? I'll note it down and get back to you later.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - Thanks! I'll be in touch.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Looks like we still have some time before it gets dark.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - How about you show me around the school? Just whatever parts you're familiar with.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After giving Ryoji a tour of the
school, I returned to the dorm.
There's something about him
that lingers in my mind...

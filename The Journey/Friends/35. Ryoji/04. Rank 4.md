Ryoji Mochizuki
...Hey.
Thanks for coming.

Minato Arisato - Selection
What happened?
Are you not feeling well?
Can this wait until tomorrow?

Ryoji Mochizuki
Looking away - Well...

Ryoji Mochizuki
Sad - Oh, right. I was absent today... Well, that's not exactly it.
Looking away - It's just...

Ryoji Mochizuki
Looking away - I was thinking the same thing, but... No, it can't wait.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Sad - How do I put this...? I suddenly just got this feeling that I'm running out of time...
Sad - And... I felt like I had to see you. I had to talk to you.
Looking away - ......

Ryoji Mochizuki
Sad - ...Sorry.
Sad - I'm not even sure what I wanted to say to you.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - So... I guess for today, I'd like to say thanks.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Thanks?
I don't get it.

Ryoji Mochizuki
It hasn't been that long since we met...
But I feel like I've learned so much by spending time with you.
Happy - I just... really wanted to thank you for that.

Ryoji Mochizuki
You showed me around the school and the city... I got to hang out with you and the others...
Happy - I even got to go on a trip with you... That was a lot of fun.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - It's been a joy to experience and learn new things every day.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - ...Just like this.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Wow.
When did you learn that?
Can I join you?

Ryoji Mochizuki
Sad - ......
Sad - I guess... I wanted you to hear this song.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - Haha, that's an interesting suggestion.
Happy - I'm sure it'd be wonderful if we could play together. But maybe we'll save that for another time.

Ryoji Mochizuki
When I saw those couples in Kyoto, or when I visited you guys at the dorm...
I realized that's what it really means to build a connection with someone.
It's that feeling of overcoming something together, and keeping each other going...

Ryoji Mochizuki
Both sides need to come to an understanding. That's how connections are built... Right?

Ryoji Mochizuki
I want you to know that you're important to me.
I know I said I wanted us to be friends, but... I actually want to be something more.
What about you...?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Why are you bringing this up?
I don't understand.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Sad - ......
Looking away - I don't really get it myself. But, I...

Fuuka's Voice
Excuse me...

Fuuka's Voice
Oh, it's you, Arisato-kun.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Sorry, I hope I didn't interrupt?
Happy - I was just passing through the hall, and I heard someone playing a beautiful song on the piano.
Happy - So I thought I'd stop by to watch the performance...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Who was the one playing? Was it you, Arisato-kun?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Not me.
Ryoji was just...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, I wanted ask. It might've just been my imagination, but...
I thought I sensed Ryoji-kun's presence in this room...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Were you not with him?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Arisato-kun...?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
......
Fuuka and I left the music room
and returned to the dorm...
The melody Ryoji played on the
piano remained fresh in my mind...

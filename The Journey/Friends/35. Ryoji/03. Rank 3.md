Ryoji Mochizuki
Oh, Minato-kun. I had a favor to ask.
Yukari-san told me there's a riverbank nearby with a great view.
Happy - Would you like to check it out with me tomorrow?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I spend my free time
with Ryoji tomorrow...?

Ryoji Mochizuki
We shouldn't let this opportunity slip by. If you're up for it, let's go check it out tomorrow.
Happy - It's really close by, too. What do you say?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I spend my free time
with Ryoji tomorrow...?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Promise Ryoji
Not now

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - Great! Sounds like a plan.
Happy - I'll come find you when we start heading back tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it!

Ryoji Mochizuki
No...? Oh, did you already make plans?
Well, let me know if you change your mind. I'd prefer to finalize my plans now, if possible.

Ryoji Mochizuki
I'll come find you when we start heading back tomorrow. I hope it won't be too cold out.

===============================================================================================

Ryoji Mochizuki
Wow, I didn't know you could come all the way down here.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - Going on trips is great, huh?
Happy - I've seen a lot of the sights here now, and everything is so fascinating.
Happy - There's so much I've never seen before, my mind's having trouble keeping up.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - I even bought myself a souvenir.
Happy - Look, it's a music box.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - Doesn't it sound nice? I don't know the name of the song, though.

Minato Arisato - Selection
I think I like it.
You could buy that anywhere.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - Haha, I'm kinda glad to hear you say that.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - Haha, is that right? But I think it's chance encounters like this that end up holding true meaning.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Sometime, way down the line, I'll listen to this melody...
And when I do, I'll think back fondly on this trip.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - The evening sun is so bright reflecting off the water's surface.
Happy - It's different from the view we get from the school roof. I wonder if this is the reason why people come to visit.

Ryoji Mochizuki
But did you know? A long time ago, this place used to be an execution site.

Minato Arisato - Selection
How do you know that?
That's ominous...

Ryoji Mochizuki
Well, that teacher with the helmet, um... Mr. Ono—he was talking about it.
He said there are numerous records of historical figures being publicly executed here.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - Haha, sorry. I didn't mean to darken the mood all of a sudden.
Happy - And that stuff happened a long time ago. Besides, it's still nice and bright out right now.

Ryoji Mochizuki
I've heard rivers have long been thought to be a border between this world and the afterlife.

Ryoji Mochizuki
But with so many couples around, it doesn't really give that impression, huh?

Ryoji Mochizuki
You know, I've been thinking...
Every one of us will die someday, right?

Ryoji Mochizuki
Eventually, the time will come when we have to part. So then, why? Why do people try so hard to connect with each other?
I'm not just talking about romance, either. It's the same for friends, family... Everyone.
For each person you connect with, it just makes saying goodbye that much harder. So what's the point?

Minato Arisato - Selection
It's necessary to survive.
We don't want to feel lonely.
Those connections are inevitable.
I don't know.

Ryoji Mochizuki
So you mean... we're forced to help each other in order to survive?
But look at everyone around us. They all genuinely like each other, don't they?
Sad - They want to be together. They're not being forced... That doesn't add up.

Ryoji Mochizuki
So you mean... we just can't stand the pain of being alone?
But look at everyone around us. They've chosen their partners out of a large crowd, haven't they?
Sad - So it's not about loneliness. They genuinely want to be with each other... Right?

Ryoji Mochizuki
So you mean... you can't escape it?
But from what I can tell, everyone around here wants to have that kind of relationship.
Happy - If they were just forced together by circumstances, I don't think they'd look so happy.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Sad - Right? It just doesn't make sense. But still...
Sad - ......
Sad - Perhaps reaching our end before we figure it out is for the best.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - Whoops, sorry, the conversation got a bit heavy there.
Happy - Looking out at the river just made me think about things for some reason.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - If you follow the flow of water, you'll eventually reach the ocean, right?
Its destination is already decided, but it takes so many different forms before it gets there.
Sometimes it's quiet and calm... Other times it's choppy rapids. Sometimes it's clear, but other times murky...

Ryoji Mochizuki
I imagine we're the same way.
We're all in the midst of a long journey, with all kinds of things happening as we go along.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - I never realized any of this until coming on this trip with you.
Happy - Everything feels that much more fascinating when you're here. I guess you could say... it expands my horizons.
Happy - Time spent talking together with you like this just feels... precious to me.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - ...Ahaha, it kinda sounds like I'm confessing my love or something, huh?

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - The wind is chilly out here by the water...
Happy - We should probably head back. Don't want to get in the way of all the couples.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I walked along the riverbank with
Ryoji, then returned to the hotel...
I feel like I understand
him a little better now...

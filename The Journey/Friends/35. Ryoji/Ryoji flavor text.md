Happy - Hey, you're Minato-kun, right? It's nice to meet you.   
Happy - You know, there are a lot of cute girls at this school. I've already asked many of them out.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
The school trip is coming up.   
Aren't you excited?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Definitely.   
Not really.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - I'll make sure we have a great time while we're there.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Oh, come on... It'll be fun.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Kirijo-san wasn't very receptive when I asked her out...   
What did I do wrong? Maybe I should've suggested a different restaurant...?   
She seems like a tough nut to crack...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Tomorrow, we leave for our trip. I can't wait.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
That trip was a blast. Especially the hot springs...   
Happy - Oops, sorry. That was supposed to be a secret, wasn't it?   
Happy - But sharing secrets is fun, too.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Did something happen to Junpei-kun? He seems kinda down...   
Sad - It's hard to see him like that. I hope he bounces back soon...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
It seems like Aigis-san has been staring at me a lot lately...   
I hope she's not going to embarrass me again.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Did you know the hot spring here is really famous?   
Happy - Every few hours, there's a surprise. *chuckle*   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
I hear there's a place somewhere around here where you can dress up like a geisha.   
Maybe I should take Yukari-san and Aigis there...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Beautiful scenery, beautiful women... Kyoto is the place to be.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
As they say...   
"A friend in need is a friend indeed."   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Hot springs are so relaxing...

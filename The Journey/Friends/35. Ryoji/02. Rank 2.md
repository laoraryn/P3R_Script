Ryoji Mochizuki   
Oh, Minato-kun. Are you free?   
I'm going out with a few ladies later, but I guess some of their friends want to talk with me first...?   
Maybe we can all go together! Wouldn't that be so much more fun?   
I think they're waiting for me on the roof. Want to come along?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Ryoji's invited me to join him. This might be a   
good opportunity to get to know him better.   
Should I spend some time   
after school with Ryoji?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
...Minato-kun, are you busy right now?   
I've got a meeting on the roof in a moment. Why don't you come along?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Ryoji's invited me to join him. This might be a   
good opportunity to get to know him better.   
Should I spend some time   
after school with Ryoji?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Spend time with Ryoji   
Not now   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Great! Then let's go.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Oh, that's unfortunate...   
I'm not very familiar with the people I'm meeting... Hopefully it isn't too awkward...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Um... It's nice to meet you...?   
Sad - So, you said you needed to talk to me?   
   
Angry Student   
Yeah, keep your hands off our girlfriends.   
   
Dissatisfied Student   
All I've been hearing her talk about is "Ryoji-kun <3"...   
   
Timid Student   
Y-Yeah, you need to stop talking to every girl you see...!   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Oh...   
Sad - Um, sorry...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
I actually have no idea which girls you're talking about. There's been too many that have come up to me.   
   
Dissatisfied Student   
Wha—? Is this a joke to you!?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - I'm sorry if I offended you...   
Sad - But I haven't made any moves on anyone. I just invited them out for a bite to eat.   
   
Angry Student   
That's exactly what we call making a move!   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - That's a problem then...   
Sad - I've made a promise to go out with them. I can't just cancel due to my inconvenience...   
   
Timid Student   
Q-Quit messing with us...!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Ryoji could get in danger if this continues...   
I should probably intervene...   
   
Angry Student   
Gimme your phone! I'm gonna delete all the contact info you have!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Calm down.   
Sorry about this.   
He doesn't know any better.   
   
Angry Student   
...Who the hell are you? This is none of your business.   
   
Dissatisfied Student   
Are you taking his side?   
   
Timid Student   
H-Hey, it's Arisato, from 2-F...   
I heard he's friends with Sanada-senpai and the student council president... They live in the same dorm...   
Wh-What do we do? If he tells them, then...   
   
Angry Student   
Tch...   
   
Dissatisfied Student   
Look, just stay the hell away from our girlfriends and delete 'em from your contacts, got it?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Surprised - ......   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Angry - All right... I'll do it.   
   
Dissatisfied Student   
Better watch out, or he'll steal your girlfriend too.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Sorry... I didn't mean to make trouble for you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Well, you did.   
It's tough being popular.   
It's not your fault.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Hmm... Guess so, huh. I really didn't expect them to be so angry.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Haha, is that what you call it? That wasn't really my intention...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - No... Considering how angry they were, I'd say I probably was at fault here.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
From now on, I will ask if they have a boyfriend first before inviting them out.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Hey, thanks for having my back.   
Happy - You're very kind.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - What a great view... The ocean looks so beautiful.   
Happy - ......   
Happy - I do like seeing it from the monorail to school each morning, but it looks so different from up here...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
...I wonder why those guys were so mad.   
Sad - If you're in a relationship with someone, that means you like each other, right?   
Sad - I don't think me getting in the picture would change that, would it...?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
I wonder what it means to like someone...   
Do you have someone like that?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yes.   
No.   
That's a secret.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Wow, that must be nice.   
Is it anybody I know? I wonder what you two talk about.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Oh, you don't, huh?   
Happy - I'm sure you'll find someone like that before long.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Haha, is that how it is?   
Happy - Well, maybe you can tell me once we get to know each other better.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
I guess there's still a lot that I don't understand...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Look at the world out there, the people in this city, our classmates in school, and you...   
......   
I want to know more about all of it.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - All right, since I dragged you into this mess today, let me make it up to you.   
Happy - I'll treat you to ramen. I just had some with Junpei-kun the other day.   
Happy - And while we're at it, maybe you can show me around town? I'd like to know what kind of places you like going to.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I spent some time with Ryoji,   
then returned to the dorm...   
I feel like I understand   
him a little better now...

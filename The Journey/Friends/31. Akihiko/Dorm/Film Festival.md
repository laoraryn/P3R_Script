Akihiko Sanada
So today's theme is the "Hidden Fist: Martial Arts" series...
Exasperated* - Somehow I get the feeling we're gonna see a lot of clichés in here.
Oh well. Let's check it out.

Bodyguard
Red Three... This can't be! You should have already reached your limit! How are you still standing...!?

Red Three
Limits exist to be broken. Now, witness my ultimate technique! Goenji Rekka Shinken: Final Form...!

Bodyguard
Ohh! Such an impressive ability... But it is I who shall prevail! Hrraaaaah!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
...The action scene continues.
I cheered for the main character,
who pulled himself up every
time he was knocked down...

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Did you see that move? His hands were on fire...

Akihiko Sanada
And the way he jumped so high... It looked like he was suspended from the ceiling.
I guess that's why they call it "wire fu," huh?

Akihiko Sanada
......
But from what I saw, I didn't really spot any specialized training.

Akihiko Sanada
They won't give up their secrets that easily. Must be why it's called the "Hidden Fist."
Angry - Ngh... I've gotta train even harder!

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - All right, I'm gonna do squats on the monorail the whole way back!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I went back to the dorm with Sanada.

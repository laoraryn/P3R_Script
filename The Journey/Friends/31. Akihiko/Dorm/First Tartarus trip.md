Akihiko Sanada
All right... It's finally time.
I know we've put a lot on you guys, but that's over now.

Minato Arisato - Selection
We're counting on you.
Don't overdo it now.
What are your strengths?

Akihiko Sanada
Scheming - Don't worry, I've been preparing for this day. You won't be disappointed.
Scheming - I'll follow whatever orders you give. You're the leader here.

Akihiko Sanada
Scheming - Heh, don't worry. I'm in perfect condition.
Scheming - I almost feel sorry for our enemy. Well, just give me a chance and you'll see.

Akihiko Sanada
I'm a power fighter that overwhelms my foes with my fists.
Scheming - ...Or so you'd think, right? But that's definitely not all there is.
Scheming - I've been sharpening my skills as well, and that includes the ability to target an enemy's weakness. Just wait, you'll see.

Akihiko Sanada
I'll make up for all that time I lost before you know it.
Plus, I've gotta show my stuff as one of the veteran members. Just make sure to put me in the advance team.

Do you know how to use the DVD player here? I thought I'd might as well use it once in a while.   
I have this compilation of some of the greatest matches between boxing legends.   
Watching professional techniques like this will surely help us in our own battles.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's important to let your muscles rest now and then, even if there's no competition the next day.   
Happy - I was thinking of doing just that today. Instead of my usual training, I'll watch a DVD.   
It's a compilation of some of the greatest matches between boxing legends.

Watching a boxing DVD with Sanada

Akihiko Sanada   
Wanna watch it together if you have time now?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's watch together.   
Not now.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'm thinking of watching another boxing DVD here today.   
It's a documentary about two champs who were rivals.

Akihiko Sanada   
Hey, good timing. Wanna watch another DVD together?   
Happy - It's a match with the heavyweight champ who many consider to be the greatest of all time.   
I burned the TV recording of it onto a DVD a while ago, and I suddenly feel like watching it again.

Happy - I'm not sure if this will help with your tournament tomorrow, but hey, maybe you'll be inspired.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Sanada's eyes are glistening   
with excitement...   
Watching a boxing DVD with him might   
help me gain more ...   
Sanada might gain a new ability soon...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
What do you say? We can start it right away if you're up for it.

Akihiko Sanada   
Boxing has a long history, and there are still many great fights to this day.   
I borrowed a new DVD from the guys on my boxing team. Feel like watching it with me?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I've heard that watching sports other than your own can be good for studying, too.   
Like boxing. It has a long history, and there are still many great fights to this day.   
Happy - I borrowed a new DVD from the guys on my boxing team. Feel like watching it with me?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It doesn't seem like Sanada will gain any more   
new skills even if I watch a DVD with him...   
But watching a boxing DVD with him might   
help me gain more ...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
A collection of the best KO's and a ranking of the greatest bouts of all time... Sounds interesting.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's watch together.   
Not now.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - All right, let's start watching.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All right, let me know if you feel like it later.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Oh, you want to watch too?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It doesn't seem like Sanada will gain any more   
new skills even if I watch a DVD with him...   
But watching a boxing DVD with him might

Akihiko Sanada   
I'll get it ready now if you want to watch it.

------   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Sanada is watching the match intently...   
I watched a boxing DVD with Sanada.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That final round was one of the greatest in the history of boxing.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel like my  has improved   
from watching the boxers fight so hard...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - All right, we should probably call it a night. Early to bed, early to rise, as they say.   
Happy - Might not be a bad idea to take some protein before you sleep. In this situation, casein would be more effective than whey...   
   
-----   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Just from looking at a single jab, you can tell how different everything is at the top level.   
And not only are both fighters strong, they each have their own unique fighting style.   
Well, what kind of fighter is your favorite?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
A boxer with a strong punch.   
A fighter with slick footwork.   
Someone with a big mouth.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah, it's exciting to see when someone's at a disadvantage, but they can instantly turn the tables with a single, crippling blow.   
You don't see it much in amateur matches because they wear headgear, but KO's are one of the most thrilling parts of boxing.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I get that. The essence of boxing is to land hits without getting hit yourself.   
I tend to rely on footwork in my matches too, but someday I'm hoping to master the style of in-fighting.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Haha, yeah. Some of the great champions are great performers, too. They really know how to put on a good show.   
A lot of people go to watch these matches, so knowing how to keep them engaged is part of the job.   
So if you're just looking to get strong, professional boxing might not be the path to take.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Now that I'm watching these again, I can see there's a lot to learn from professional matches.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Plus, when I do it here, I have someone to discuss things with.   
Happy - Let's do this again next time you're free.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel like my  has improved   
from watching the intense boxing matches...

Akihiko Sanada   
Man...   
Happy - Watching those guys fighting is making it hard for me to sit still.   
Happy - You wanna head to my room and whale on the punching bag for a bit?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - In this fight, each side had one win and one loss. A serious all-or-nothin' match.   
Happy - And the fact that they were lifelong rivals only helped them push each other to the top.   
Do you have anyone you'd consider a rival?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I think so.   
Nope.   
You're my rival.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Well, good. Make sure you don't lose to them.   
Happy - They must be pretty good if they're on your radar. Kinda makes me wanna see how I'd fare against them.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Haha, yeah. I can't imagine there are too many people out there who can match you.   
Happy - If you ever do find someone though, I'd be curious to see how I'd fare against them.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Heh, interesting. I think facing off against you would make for a good match.   
Happy - But I have no intention of losing. Maybe we should try sparring sometime.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Anyways, you'd have to be really lucky to find a partner like that.   
Happy - All the athletes from the other schools avoid me, so it's tough finding an opponent to spar with.   
And I don't think a longtime childhood friend is quite the same thing as a rival...   
Happy - But hey, the world is a big place. I'll just keep polishing my skills until I find the right person.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Haha, sorry. We were supposed to be relaxing, but I just ended up talking the whole time.   
Happy - Let's do this again. I'll put on some real good matches then.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel like my  has improved   
from watching these two rivals clash...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Ah, I didn't notice the time.   
Happy - Before you go to sleep... you wanna crack a raw egg for some protein first?

Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - All right, today we're gonna see some of the greatest matches the champs have ever—   
   
Hm?   
   
Female Announcer (SE)   
...And here we are with the first match of the qualifiers. In the red corner, we have...   
Akihiko Sanada-kun, from Gekkoukan High School!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's me...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
This is footage from my first official match. My coach from back then recorded it for me.   
Ah, sorry, looks like I put on the wrong video. Let me switch it out.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I want to see this.   
You look so young.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Exasperated* - Hey, come on. It's not that interesting.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah, I guess it has been quite some time.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - But I guess this might be a good opportunity. Let's watch it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
......   
I look so stiff and nervous. And my form is all over the place...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
How did I even win this? At least I can tell I've improved since then.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Here's where I get my left straight in.   
   
Female Announcer (SE)   
And the winner is Sanada-kun, from the red corner!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Check out my face. I'm trying to look calm, but on the inside I can barely contain myself.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - I know I said before that I just wanted to learn how to fight with my bare hands, but this might actually be why I stuck with boxing.   
This victory gave me confidence. I wasn't so stiff in any of my later matches.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Are you the type to get nervous in front of a bunch of people like that?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Not really.   
I'd say so.   
I don't know.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - That's what I like to hear. You're just as reliable as a leader ought to be.   
Happy - If you ever wanna try getting in the ring, I'd be glad to have you.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Well, that's a surprise. You don't seem like you let the small things bother you.   
Happy - But I guess you're good at not letting your weakness show, huh?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Yeah, I guess you wouldn't really know how tense that feels without experiencing it for yourself.   
Happy - If you ever wanna try getting in the ring, I'd be glad to have you.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I've learned a lot from boxing, but there's a strict rule I follow when it comes to winning.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Find your opportunity, then strike without hesitation.   
It's easy enough to remember, but hard to apply. You could say the same thing about fighting Shadows, too.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I've always tried to keep those words in mind, but now I'll be even more conscious of them.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Sanada seems to have found new potential   
within himself after watching the DVD.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Scheming - You know, I never thought you'd see me like that... But it did help remind me how I felt when I was starting out.   
Happy - Anyway, sorry you had to sit through that. We'll save the champion matches for next time.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel like my  has improved   
after seeing Sanada fighting his hardest...   
   
Female Announcer (SE)   
...Now we move on to round two of the qualifiers.   
In the red corner: Akihiko Sanada-kun, from Gekkoukan High School!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - ...There's another one? Well, since we're already here, wanna watch some more before we go to sleep?

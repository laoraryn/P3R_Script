Akihiko Sanada
Hey, do you know how to cook?
I have to eat enough to make up for what I burn during training, so it ends up being a lot of food.
It's easier to just cook it all at once. I'd appreciate your help, if you have the time.

Akihiko Sanada
By the way... do you know how to cook?
Sad - I need to make up for what I burn while training, and even more so with our next operation soon.
So it's a lot of food, but it's easier to just cook it all at once. I'd appreciate your help, if you can.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Looks like Sanada wants
me to cook with him...
Should I spend the evening with Sanada?

Akihiko Sanada
So, can I count on you?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure, I'll help.
Maybe another time.

Akihiko Sanada
Oh, Arisato.
Can you help me out with cooking again? It's a lot for me to do by myself.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Looks like Sanada wants
me to cook with him...

Akihiko Sanada
I already have all the ingredients. So, can you help me?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure, I'll help.
Maybe another time.

Akihiko Sanada
Oh, perfect timing.
Happy - I got some good news, so I was thinking of splurging and cooking up something nice.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Oh, perfect timing.
Happy - I got some good news, so I was thinking of splurging and cooking up something nice.
Happy - Plus, our next operation is coming up. Probably not a bad idea to replenish your strength, right?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
...Sanada seems enthusiastic.
Sanada might gain a new ability soon...
Should I spend the evening with him?

Akihiko Sanada
How about it? Why don't you join me?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure, I'll help.
I'm a bit busy today...

Akihiko Sanada
I'm about to run out of my protein-packed food stock.
If you aren't busy, wanna help me make more?

Akihiko Sanada
I mentioned earlier that I expanded my training menu, didn't I?
Sad - Well, because of that, I'm about to run out of my protein-packed food stock...
If you aren't busy, wanna help me make more?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It doesn't seem like Sanada will gain any
more new skills even if I cook with him...

Akihiko Sanada
Of course, you can take a portion for yourself, too.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure, I'll help.
Not now.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Thanks. Then let's get to it.

Akihiko Sanada
Oh, okay. I'll see you later, then.

Akihiko Sanada
Hm? Did you decide to help me?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It doesn't seem like Sanada will gain any
more new skills even if I cook with him...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I spend the evening with Sanada?

Akihiko Sanada
It's a bit much to do all on my own, you see.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure, I'll help.
Not now.

Akihiko Sanada
Meat and eggs are essential for building a healthy body, and there's no better choice than chicken.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I cooked food an athlete
would eat with Sanada.

Akihiko Sanada
This should last a while. Let's put it in the freezer.

Akihiko Sanada
Thanks for always helping out. Let me know when you want some more.

Akihiko Sanada
Chicken tenderloin, eggs, broccoli... We're gonna boil 'em one after the other.
This is a staple for an athlete. Full of valuable nutrients, and not too hard to cook, either.
The problem is what comes after.
Next you gotta portion everything out, and then put it in the freezer. It's a lot of work.

Minato Arisato - Selection
You sure work hard.
Sounds like a pain.
The protein powder's not enough?

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Not really. I'm just lazy, so I want to do everything in one go.
Happy - But if I want to get stronger, I have to do whatever it takes.

Akihiko Sanada
Well hey, can't just eat it all at once. Your body needs some time between meals.
The human body needs a lot. You just gotta learn to deal with it.

Akihiko Sanada
Getting all of your protein from supplements isn't really realistic.
Plus, protein powder is expensive and food gives you other nutrients, too.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - All right, let's get started.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - It's done. This should last for a while.
Happy - That really went by fast. The work is so much more efficient with two of us.
Happy - Here, you take some, too. It's perfect for a midnight snack, since it won't really put on fat.

Akihiko Sanada
I know your diet is important for building a strong body, but I'll admit, I'm not much of a cook.
Happy - I could use your help again sometime, if you don't mind. I might be able to try something more elaborate with your help.
Happy - Maybe I should buy some pig's feet. I hear they're rich in collagen.

Akihiko Sanada
I recently expanded my outdoor exercise regimen, and I wanted to boost my nutrition to match.
So I got some pork liver today because it's supposed to be rich in iron.
But I don't think it'll taste like much if I just boil it like usual...
That's why I'm gonna try cooking a pork liver stir-fry. I already looked up how to make it. Think you can help out?

Minato Arisato - Selection
You bet.
That sounds hard.
Do it yourself.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Good to hear. You like this dish, too?

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - I thought so too, but the recipe is actually pretty simple.
...The only thing I can't handle is flipping the food in the pan. So I'm hoping you can manage that part.

Akihiko Sanada
Hey, don't be like that. I don't think I can flip the food in the pan myself.
Come on, call it a favor. This is supposed to be a really healthy dish.

Akihiko Sanada
I've already cleaned the meat ahead of time.
All that's left is to cook the liver, then stir the chives and bean sprouts in, and that should be it.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Wow, this is great!
Happy - I guess it was a good thing I took the time for all that prep.
Happy - They say a boxing match is decided before the bell even rings. Maybe this is kind of the same thing.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Oh, sorry. Obviously this wouldn't have been possible without your help.
I've still got a lot to learn, but it's hard to make time for it with all my training and stuff.
...Maybe if I attach weights to the pan when I'm flipping, I could kill two birds with one stone!

Akihiko Sanada
I'll handle the cooking. You just eat, and then take care of cleanup afterwards.
Happy - This time I wanna try hotpot. I can probably handle that, right?

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - ...Hey, don't worry.
We've got chicken, onions, carrots, mushrooms, tofu... Nothing strange here, just regular ingredients.
All right, why don't you go get a plate and sit tight?

Akihiko Sanada
I've been so busy lately, I've had to leave most of the boxing team activities to the junior members.
Happy - But they actually won a team event at a rookie tournament, so I thought I'd put together this little celebration for them.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Congrats.
That's the way, captain.
Why hotpot?

Akihiko Sanada
It was just a small tournament that a third-year like me couldn't even enter, but still, they really came together as a team to win it.
Happy - So even though I wasn't much of a captain for them, I'm still proud of their achievement.

Akihiko Sanada
Actually, I've been so occupied with my own problems that I haven't been able to coach them much.
Happy - Still, they appreciate the work I do put in, so I'm proud of them.

Akihiko Sanada
Why? Because it looks fancy, doesn't it?
Happy - Plus, it's nutritious. It's everything an athlete could ask for.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - I gotta say though, hotpot is an interesting concept.
Happy - Every ingredient adds its own flavor, and the end result is so great.
It'd be nice if SEES could mesh just as well, with our ragtag group of members.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Everyone's too different.
I think they could.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - But isn't it your job as the leader to find out how to make everyone better than the sum of their parts?

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - I know everyone's wildly different from each other, but if there's anyone who can make it work, it's you.

Akihiko Sanada
Anyway, when I'm out there on the front lines, I'll make sure I'm in a position to showcase my strengths.
Boxing's taught me that once I get into the rhythm of battle, nothing can stop me.
Scheming - That's my fighting style. Don't forget it.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Sanada is passionate about the
success of his boxing teammates.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - It's nice to be able to share a hotpot with someone else like this.
Happy - Maybe I'll do this with the boxing team too, if I ever get a chance.

Akihiko Sanada
All right, now how do we finish the broth?
Maybe udon, or rice porridge... Or how about some protein dumplings?

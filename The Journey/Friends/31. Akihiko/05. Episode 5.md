   
Akihiko Sanada   
There you are. Are you free now?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend the evening with Sanada?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Are you free tonight? Let me know if you have some time to spare.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend the evening with Sanada?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Spend time with Sanada   
Not now   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - All right. Have you decided what you want to eat?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I see. I'm sure you have a lot going on right now.   
   
-----   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - All right, I think it's finally time for me to pay you back for everything.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
I see you two are together again today.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Kurosawa-san, I don't usually see you around here. Is there something wrong?   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
No, I'm just helping patrol the area.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
...You might've noticed already, but the city's been feeling a little different lately.   
We can't be sure what'll happen. Make sure not to stay out too late.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Thanks. You be careful, too.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
I will.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
At any rate, this is perfect timing. There's something I've been wanting to ask you.   
Recently, your friend here's been bothering me about my work.   
I don't know what he's up to, but I'm hoping you might have an idea.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Not a clue.   
He feels guilty.   
He looks up to you.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I just figured I should get to know Kurosawa-san better since he's done so much for me.   
...And maybe I just want a bit of a reference for the future. I'll tell you about it later.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Exasperated* - What're you talking about? Even if that were true, Kurosawa-san wouldn't buy that.   
We all know he's as stubborn as a mule. It'd be faster to just come clean and apologize.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
...I'm right here, you know.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
Oh? You thinking of becoming a police officer?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
No... Well, I haven't really thought that far yet.   
I just figured I should get to know you better, Kurosawa-san, since you've done so much for me.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
......   
I've had my eye on this guy for a long time, but I have to say... he's changed a lot this past year.   
Is this your doing? If it is, then I hope you'll keep looking after him.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
He has a tendency to get himself into trouble when you're not watching.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
Oh, and just to illustrate what I mean...   
...At the end of last year, we had an incident where a large number of gang members were found knocked out at Naganaki Shrine.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
Seemed to be the result of a fight, but no matter who we asked, they all claimed it was their own fault. The attacker is still unknown.   
We thought it might've been a clash with another gang in the area, but some of our sources suggest there were only two culprits.   
The most surprising part is, no one found at the scene had any actual injuries.   
It's kind of unbelievable, considering their sheer numbers. Whoever did it must have been pretty skilled...   
......   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
But in the end, the victims were just a group of infamous punks.   
They probably pushed their luck one too many times and got what was coming to them.   
It's very likely the other side acted in self-defense. And with no injuries, we probably don't need to pursue this case any further.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You're dropping it?   
Thank goodness...   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
...I have no idea why the two of you would look so relieved to hear this.   
I may be an officer of the law, but I'm a human being first.   
If there are those with integrity who know how to use the power they're given, then I'm not above helping that cause.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - ......   
...I think I'm starting to see the path I need to take.   
Thank you, Kurosawa-san.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
I haven't done anything to deserve thanks. I was just musing to myself...   
Things may have turned out fine this time, but you'd better avoid pulling a stunt like that again.   
Nowadays, it's becoming more common for goons like them to carry guns.   
Maybe it's inevitable, given how connected the world is, but things just seem more dangerous lately.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sounds scary.   
It's not that big of a deal.   
Sanada can handle it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah, guns are pretty common in other parts of the world, not to mention all the tough fighters abroad.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I wouldn't be so sure. Against a gun, your best bet is to feint and approach from the side.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I don't know about that. Against a gun, you'd have to feint and approach from the side.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Living abroad, though... Now that's a thought.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - I'll have a lot of freedom once I graduate. It might be fun to see how far my fists can take me.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
There he goes again...   
Jokes aside, you certainly get a lot of opportunities when you're young. I do miss that sometimes.   
Maybe the three of us can get together for a drink someday. Well, I'll be on my way.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Someday, huh...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You know, I've had to do a lot of thinking about the future lately, what with entrance exams and all.   
No matter what path I take, I intend to keep on fighting.   
But I'm sure there are some things out there I won't be able to do alone.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - That's why, someday, I want to become a leader, just like you.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...Well, I'm getting ahead of myself. We've got a job to do before that.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'm gonna protect you and all my friends. I'm gonna fight for our futures.   
And I'm gonna be the big brother she'd be proud of.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That reminds me, I should give these to you before I forget.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
DEV: *Unused message labels.    
*If this appears, it is a bug.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Go ahead and use those if you want. I'll teach you how to wrap them later.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Why give me these?   
Is there a reason for this?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
No particular reason...   
But if you have those on, they'll stabilize your grip on your weapon during battles. Just take 'em for now.   
They're what let me use my fists to their full potential. In a way, you do the same thing for me.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - All right, how about we end the night on a high note with some good eating?   
Happy - Anything goes today, so don't be shy. I'll be taking care of the check.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Wow, generous.   
You sound like an old man.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
For tonight at least.   
You and I will be going strong for years to come. You'll get your turn eventually.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Haha, do I?   
Kurosawa-san told me it'd put us on better terms if I said that.   
Happy - Well, I'll work on it. You and I will be going strong for years to come. Just call this a practice run.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - All right, let's go.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The two of us ate and had a spirited   
discussion about the upcoming battle...   
   
SYS_042_0_0   
You have forged a powerful bond with Sanada! You can now fuse **Horus**, the god of the skies!

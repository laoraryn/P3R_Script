   
Akihiko Sanada   
...Oh, Arisato.   
Happy - Today's the day I finally return the favor. Are you free?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend the evening with Sanada?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Today's the day I finally return the favor. Are you free now?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend the evening with Sanada?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Spend time with Sanada   
Not now   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - All right, then let's go.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I see...   
Sorry that I only have time at night... Let me know the next time you're free.   
   
-----   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All right, this time let's have a nice meal as we talk about our future battles...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Or do you not care, as long as you're the one who gets to do the fighting?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - ......   
Sad - ...Our future battles, huh...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What's wrong?   
Are you tired?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I-It's fine, don't worry about it. First things first, let's get some food.   
   
Passing Woman (SE)   
Hey, what's going on...?   
   
Shopping Woman (SE)   
This doesn't look good...   
   
Rough Voice   
There you are, Akihiko Sanada.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Oh, you're the guys from before...   
   
Unfriendly Man   
Turns out you're pretty famous, huh? An up-and-comin' boxer, that it?   
   
Tough Guy   
Time to pick up where we left off. Show me what you got.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - ......   
   
Tough Guy   
Kickin' your ass is gonna do wonders for our rep. No way we're gonna pass this up.   
   
Underling   
Champ or not, look at our numbers. You ain't got a chance!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
This isn't fair.   
Take him one on one.   
I'm calling the police.   
   
Unfriendly Man   
Psh, boxers are tough, ain't they? What, you can't handle a challenge?   
   
Underling   
You're welcome to join him though, pipsqueak. See, we're reasonable, right? Hahahaha!   
   
Unfriendly Man   
Go on then. It'll only take a second for us to beat the shit outta you.   
   
Man Showing Off   
Maybe you wanna call an ambulance instead? Hahahaha!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - You said beating me would do wonders for your rep.   
Angry - I thought this was about testing each other's strength.   
   
Tough Guy   
You idiot. I'm just gonna have fun kickin' your ass 'cause you're full of yourself.   
And who the hell cares about any of that, as long as you win. Isn't that how you roll too?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - ......   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It looks like a fight is going to break   
out. I have to do something...   
   
Tough Guy   
...So you wanna go first, or what?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Get back, Arisato!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Officer, over here!   
Look out, it's a fire!   
   
Tough Guy (SE)   
Are you shitting me!? Get back here!   
   
Unfriendly Man   
Hey! Nobody runs away from us!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Exasperated* - Phew... Running away is easy enough. It's losing them that's the hard part.   
Happy - Still, made for a good workout, right?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That was some quick thinking, by the way. Just what I'd expect from our leader.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Not a problem.   
That was close.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I don't exactly like turning my back to an opponent, but it doesn't matter in the end if I can't protect the ones beside me.   
And being outnumbered increases our risk of injury or damaging our surroundings.   
Happy - What I mean is you made the right call. I owe you one.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Hm...?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's addressed to me... Says it contains "fruits, snacks, and beverages."   
Looks like it's from my parents. I'll take it to my room later.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Your parents?   
There sure is a lot.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah. My foster parents that adopted me.   
I haven't kept in touch lately since I'm so busy, but it sounds like they're doing well.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah, it's probably because they think I'm a growing boy and all that.   
I haven't kept in touch lately since I'm so busy, but I should probably write back and thank them.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I appreciate how much they care, but this is a little too generous. Wanna take some of it off my hands?   
Sad - Then again, you'll hardly make a dent in this either...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's call the others.   
You can share with everyone.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Good idea. Would you mind gathering everyone up?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi (SE)   
Oh my!   
   
Junpei Iori (SE)   
Ooh!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo (SE)   
Oh?   
   
Yukari Takeba (SE)   
Wow...   
   
(SE) Ken Amada   
Oh, wow!   
   
Aigis (SE)   
Intriguing.   
   
Koromaru (SE)   
*pant* *pant*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Everything is such high quality. I can tell just by looking.   
Your parents must really care about you.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - At least you know how to behave in front of your parents, Akihiko.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Exasperated* - ...Don't you ever have anything nice to say about me?   
My parents have been good to me. I obviously haven't told them about what we do here, though.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Wow, when it comes to bein' considerate of others, you're a heavyweight! Glad to have you in our corner, Senpai!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - There he goes again...   
Happy - These sure look good, though. Thanks for sharing, Sanada-senpai.   
   
Akihiko Sanada (SE)   
Take whatever you want.   
   
Yukari Takeba (SE)   
Hey, this looks really good.   
   
Junpei Iori (SE)   
Oh, goin' for that one huh, Yuka-tan?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi (SE)   
Hey, Kirijo-senpai, what's that?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo (SE)   
Oh, this looks like it was meant for royalty...   
   
(SE) Ken Amada   
Oh, I see!   
   
Aigis (SE)   
Much appreciated.   
   
Koromaru (SE)   
Arf, arf!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That took care of most of it. I'm surprised they were so happy.   
......   
I've really gotta show my gratitude. To my parents, and to everyone here.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well...   
All this talk about my parents reminded me of some things from the past, like why I'm here right now.   
I guess I feel like I remember my reason for fighting.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I don't really get it.   
Glad to hear it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Well, don't mind me. Let's just say I've got a lot of room to grow.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - The dorm's gotten so much busier. The orphanage used to be something like this, too.   
Happy - We all lived under the same roof, just having casual conversations. I'd forgotten what it was like, but it wasn't so bad.   
I remembered after you suggested we share with everyone.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You're exaggerating.   
Let's do it again sometime.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - You think so?   
People are always telling me I need to be more aware of things like that, though.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Tell that to my parents.   
I've really gotta repay you in particular though, or we'll never be squared away.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All right, it's pretty late now. I guess we should clean up and call it a night.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
...?   
There's something mixed in here. It's a letter,   
and some sort of hand-crafted object...   
It looks like a gold medal   
that's made of cardboard.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
What? Is there something there?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - This is...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Is it also a gift?   
Is it yours?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - No, this is mine...   
You won't understand what it means, but it's from a long time ago.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - ......   
This medal doesn't really belong to anyone. It's from a long time ago.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Do you mind if I ask you something?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You take on the role of our leader, and you're stronger than anyone else in your own right.   
That's more than just being talented. Where do you get that strength from?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I train.   
It's thanks to the bonds I have.   
I don't do anything.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
So you mean you're putting in work behind the scenes?   
I thought I put a lot of time into training myself, but now I'm not so sure.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Oh, I see. You mean you feel motivated because you have people in your corner?   
...Bonds with others, huh. That might be something I'm missing.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Heh, so you don't even know what your own secret is? You're on a completely different level.   
But you know, I think that's just how it is for the ones who have true strength.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well, whatever it is, you've clearly got something that I don't.   
But being jealous or trying to copy you isn't gonna help me. That strength is yours alone.   
I'm going to get stronger... But I'll do it my way.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sorry, we were supposed to be cleaning up. I'll take care of the rest.   
Things got so busy that I missed out on my chance to thank you again.   
Hopefully the food was enough for today. I'll invite you out again some other time.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I took Sanada's gesture of appreciation,   
then returned to my room...   
I feel like my  has   
improved after seeing how   
Sanada cares for his parents...

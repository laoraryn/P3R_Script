Akihiko Sanada
Thanks for coming. It's pretty cold today, huh?
You saw my text, right? Wanna get moving and warm up a little?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I spend the evening with Sanada?

Akihiko Sanada
I wanted to talk to you about something.
I know it's a little late, but feel like getting a quick warm-up in?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I spend the evening with Sanada?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Spend time with Sanada
Not now

Akihiko Sanada
Cool. Let's do this.
Happy - I know this wasn't your idea, but I'm not planning on letting you cut corners.
Happy - All right. First on the list is jogging to Naganaki Shrine. Let's go!

Akihiko Sanada
I see. Well, I'm not gonna force you.
But it's not so bad once in a while, you know? Let me know if you're up for it another time.

-----

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - You were actually able to keep up with me on my training regimen. I'm impressed.
......

(SE) Akihiko Sanada
Hmph...!

Akihiko Sanada
So, what do you think?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Of what?
I'm tired.

Akihiko Sanada
Well...
The reason I asked you to join me today is...

Rough Voice
...We finally found you, Akihiko Sanada.

Tough Guy
We've had a good run up until now, but today's where it ends.

Lackey
Don't feel bad about screamin' if you gotta. No one's comin' to save you, though.

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - These guys just don't know when to quit.

Underling
There's no gettin' away this time. Not for you, and not for your chicken-shit buddy, either.

Tough Guy
Not that it'd matter anyway. You guys live at the dorm nearby, don't you?

Lackey
Yeah, we saw some girls there, and a kid too. I sure hope they're keeping safe... Hahahaha!

Minato Arisato - Selection
You won't get away with this.
You're the scum of the earth.

Akihiko Sanada
...Stay back, Arisato.
Angry - I'll create an opening so you can escape.

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - If you're going after my friends, then I'll be your first obstacle.
Angry - Come on, make your move.

Tough Guy
Ngh...

Tough Guy
...D-Don't you know what'll happen if a trained guy like you hits an amateur?
The boxing team'll be suspended, and you'll be expelled! Or worse, you'll go to prison and your life'll be over.
Is that what you want? Huh!?

Akihiko Sanada
That is true. I could never do something like that to my supervisor, or my boxing teammates.

Lackey
Heheheh.

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - ...But even if that's how I feel, I can't back down now.
Angry - I'll carry that responsibility, and pay for it the rest of my life if I have to.
Angry - I will protect what's important to me... That's why I have these fists.

Underling
What the hell're you goin' on about...!?

Akihiko Sanada
Surprised - Oh, Arisato...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's get 'em.
It's legitimate self-defense.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Heh, all right then.
I'll trust my back to you. Just try not to hurt 'em—I'm sure you can handle that.

Tough Guy
Cocky little bastards!

Akihiko Sanada
Looks like that does it. That was quite the challenge, considering their numbers.
Are you all right, Arisato?

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - ...Don't ever show your face around here again.
Angry - If I ever hear you're threatening my friends, you know what'll happen next.

Tough Guy
G-Got it...

Akihiko Sanada
Come on, it's getting cold. Plus, someone might've called the police.
Let's go to my room for now.

===============================================================================================

Akihiko Sanada
...Well, I'd like to put out some tea, but I have to take these off first.

Minato Arisato - Selection
What are those?
Stylish.

Akihiko Sanada
They're hand wraps, mainly for protecting my hands and wrists.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - They're more than just fashionable. These hand wraps protect my hands and wrists.

Akihiko Sanada
Not only do these protect me, but they can affect the power of my punches depending on how I wrap them.
Whether my fists deal damage or not depends on these. I guess they're like my partners in the ring.

Akihiko Sanada
Anyways, make yourself comfortable.

Akihiko Sanada
So, the reason I asked you to join me today... It's because I wanted you to know what I've been working on.
I spent a lot of time training and gaining more experience...

Akihiko Sanada
And I thought I'd finally reached a point where I could feel confident in my abilities.

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - ...But after hearing what the Appriser said, I felt afraid.
Sad - I felt anger too, knowing that all the training I'd put myself through was meaningless.
Sad - I told myself I'd face things head-on, but I'm still as weak as I was before.
Tell me... Do you think I'm strong enough now?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Definitely.
I don't know.
Don't lose hope.

Akihiko Sanada
Heh. I'd like to think so, but I did lose my way.

Akihiko Sanada
Fair enough. Maybe I'll find my answer in the near future.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Heh, you're totally right. I'm sure I'll find my answer soon enough.

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - Everyone loses confidence in themselves from time to time, and that's when their weakness rears its ugly head.
Sad - Being on the verge of grasping something, but grappling with the fear and frustration of losing everything again... It's so hard to overcome.
Sad - And it's a feeling I understand all too well.

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - I know we've pushed this crucial decision on you, and I can only imagine how hard that must be.
But... try not to blame Junpei and the others.

Minato Arisato - Selection
I know.
They can make it up to me.
A little late for that.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Huh. You really are strong, you know that?

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - That's fine. I know they'll come through.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - I guess I could've saved you some trouble if I spoke up sooner, huh?

Akihiko Sanada
Anyway, as someone who was there too, I just wanted you to know.

Akihiko Sanada
...No matter what you decide, I'm still gonna do what I have to do.

Akihiko Sanada
I've faced off against countless opponents to get where I am now.
If I said all my training was meaningless, then that would be spitting on all of their efforts, too.
And that would be absolutely unacceptable. Wouldn't you agree?

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Sorry, I didn't mean to go on a tangent like that.
Not only did I ask you to join me today, but you got dragged into my fight, too. I've gotta at least pay you back for that...

Akihiko Sanada
Hmm... I'm pretty sure my special protein blend is around here somewhere...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
......
I can see a familiar handmade
craft on the desk.
It's that cardboard gold medal
that Sanada's sister made...

Akihiko Sanada
Oh, that.
I was thinking of sending that back to my parents when I write them a New Year's card.
Sad - We don't know how the future's gonna turn out. It's better if it doesn't stay with me...

Minato Arisato - Selection
This belongs to you.
Don't run away.

Akihiko Sanada
Surprised - ...!

Akihiko Sanada
You're one unusual guy. I was thinking this during the fight earlier, but...
Happy - For some reason, I feel like I can trust you to watch my back. Together, we can overcome anything.

Akihiko Sanada
For a long time, all I cared about was having the power to protect others.
And I thought being hard on myself and competing with others was the only way I was gonna do that.
Although, it is true that I've gotten more capable through my reckless approach.

Akihiko Sanada
But now, there are others who fight alongside me.
So I have people who I want to protect, but at the same time, I want them to be there fighting with me.
...In the end, it's because I have all of you that I feel like I can become even stronger.

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - ...I still don't know if I'm strong or kind enough to deserve this medal.
But this is my starting point, and it's something that I should keep with me.

Akihiko Sanada
You've taught me another valuable lesson today. Now, where to put this...?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let me see it.
Display it.

Akihiko Sanada
Oh, sure...

Akihiko Sanada
Surprised - ...!

Akihiko Sanada
......

Akihiko Sanada
Yeah, I think I will.

Akihiko Sanada
......

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - ...I did it, Miki.

Minato Arisato - Selection
You deserve it.
Keep working hard.

Akihiko Sanada
...It's a huge honor. I'll fight to protect it like a champ guarding his title.

Akihiko Sanada
Heh, if you say so. I'll keep fighting like I'm up for a shot at the title belt.

Akihiko Sanada
...I may not be very good at motivating people with words, or communicating how I feel.
But you can trust I'll never back down from a fight.
Even if I'm battered and on the ground, I'll get back up every time.

Akihiko Sanada
I'll never give up. That's my duty to all of you.
So you can count on me... I swear I will protect you.

Akihiko Sanada
...That being said, there's still so much I owe you for.
I'll be doing what I can to pay back that debt. I haven't really thanked you for all your help until now, either.

Akihiko Sanada
Ah, right. I was going to at least thank you for what you did today.

Akihiko Sanada
......
Sad - Damn... Looks like I'm out of protein powder.
What else do I have...? Ah, here. You can have these dumbbells.

Akihiko Sanada
Just a minute. I'll get them ready for you.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - You can change the weight on these ones to match whatever your muscle strength is.
Happy - In your case, I'd start with 8kg... No, actually I think you can handle 10.
Happy - You could also use a machine, but you gotta do some resistance training with free weights, too.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I quietly acknowledged Sanada's
determination, then returned to my room.
I feel inspired by his enthusiasm...

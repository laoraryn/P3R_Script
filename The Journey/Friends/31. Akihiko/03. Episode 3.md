   
Akihiko Sanada   
Ah, there you are.   
Happy - I've actually finished my shopping already...   
Do you have some time now? I want your help for something.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend the evening with Sanada?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - There's something I want to try.   
If you're free, I'd like you to accompany me.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend the evening with Sanada?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Spend time with Sanada   
Not now   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Thanks. Then let's head back to the dorm together.   
...Ah, crap. I forgot to buy eggs.   
Sorry, but can you go back first and make sure no one uses the kitchen? I'll meet you there in a bit.   
Don't worry, I won't keep you waiting long. I'm quicker on my feet than you are, you know.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I see. That's fine.   
Maybe next time. Let me know when you're free.   
   
-----   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It looks like Sanada isn't here yet...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sorry I'm late. I ran into some unexpected trouble.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All right, here goes. Back me up, would you?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'm gonna make pancakes. Think you can help?   
Happy - I guess you could say I've got a craving... I used to eat them all the time at the orphanage.   
Happy - I know they sell frozen ones nowadays, but nothing beats freshly cooked, right?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Why now?   
You're making a lot...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I don't really need a reason, do I? I just felt like it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You think so? I just thought more would be better than less.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well, let's go on and get started. Okay, first things first...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...Uh, what exactly do we do first?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I think the recipe said to use lots of butter and to regulate the pan's temperature with a damp washcloth.   
...Wait, we put a washcloth in the pan? Won't it burn?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Want me to do it...?   
Please, just let me handle it...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You sure? Thanks. I don't know how to cook anything besides the stuff I use for bodybuilding.   
I can break the eggs and mix the batter. I'll leave the actual cooking part to you.   
   
Akihiko Sanada (SE)   
Oh, so that's how you use the washcloth.   
   
Akihiko Sanada (SE)   
How about we add some protein powder...?   
   
Akihiko Sanada (SE)   
Hey, don't look at me like that.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
   
Akihiko Sanada (SE)   
Oh, I better go get the plates.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - All right, I think this'll be enough.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Oh, check it out!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Wow, look at all the pancakes! I knew something smelled good.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Yeah, just give me a minute. We can eat once I bring them out.   
Happy - Would you mind getting everyone else? And don't forget Amada.   
   
Yukari Takeba (SE)   
Happy - Okayyy!   
   
Fuuka (SE)   
Happy - Okay!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Whoa... It's like a Tartarus of pancakes!   
   
Ken Amada   
Did the two of you make all of these yourselves?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Yeah, although Arisato was the one who cooked 'em. I said I had a hankering, but we might've made too much.   
Happy - I like pancakes, but no way I can eat all of these myself. If you guys could pitch in, that'd be great.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - ...So you like pancakes too, Sanada-san.   
Happy - Thank you! I can't wait to have some!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - I'll make some tea. I've got some leaves that'd be great for the occasion.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - It's pancake party time! ...As they say.   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Arf!   
   
Ken Amada (SE)   
...These are so good! I could eat them all day.   
   
Akihiko Sanada (SE)   
Oh yeah? Good to hear.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi (SE)   
The flavor brings a smile to my face!   
   
Junpei Iori (SE)   
Would ya say it... takes the cake?   
   
Yukari Takeba (SE)   
What are you, the chairman?   
These really are good though!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo (SE)   
They've been cooked to absolute perfection. My compliments to the chef.   
   
Aigis (SE)   
What is the difference between pancakes and hotcakes?   
   
Koromaru (SE)   
Arf, arf!   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Thanks for the pancakes. They were really good.   
Happy - Tasted like a lot of care went into them.   
Happy - If you ever make some again, I'd like to help out, too!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - For as many as we made, they sure did disappear fast.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Cooking's not really one of my strong points.   
A certain someone would always say, "If you pour protein powder on the ingredients, then you shouldn't be in the kitchen, dumbass."   
Most of the time I only ever got to watch someone else cook, so I never really learned myself.   
Happy - Anyways, thanks for helping out today. I'm hoping that cheered everyone up a little.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You planned this from the start?   
What made you want to do this?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah, pretty much.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
They did things like this back when I was at the orphanage. I just wanted to re-create it.   
My sister used to cry all the time there, but the pancakes always brought a smile to her face.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
......   
...Do you remember that medal you found in the package from my parents?   
My sister, Miki... She made that back when we were at the orphanage.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Based on the letter that came with it, I guess my parents found it when they were cleaning.   
Miki was gonna give that to me after we learned I was getting adopted out and leaving.   
Sad - ...But then that fire happened right after, and this medal was all that was left of her.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sounds like you two were close.   
I'm sorry to hear that.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...Apparently, Miki used to always say she wanted to thank me for being so strong and kind.   
She was really quiet, and she'd always be following me around.   
I don't really remember doing anything special for her, but I guess she was relying on me as her older brother.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Seeing that medal made me think.   
Would my sister be proud of who I am now?   
Am I really strong and kind enough to deserve that medal?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - If I'm being honest, I don't really know what it means to be strong or kind.   
Sad - Everyone who's ever said that to me has left without telling me the most important part.   
Sad - You saw how I was today... This is all I'm capable of right now.   
Sad - I haven't grown at all since I was a kid. They'd laugh if they saw me now.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's not true.   
You're plenty strong and kind.   
Can't fight on an empty stomach.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...Maybe my sister would say that, but you know not everyone would cut me that much slack.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Heh. I'm glad you feel that way, but I've still got a long way to go.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - That's true. Sweet foods can relieve fatigue. I think I'll be ready to fight again by tomorrow.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I realized I'd just been running away all this time, making excuses about having my own problems.   
But from now on, I'm gonna protect it all.   
We promised we'd become strong together... I won't let him down.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I know you can do it.   
I'll help whenever you need.   
Best of luck.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Well, if that's how you feel, then I better not disappoint.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Thanks, I really appreciate that. I'll be counting on you next time.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Yeah. I've got people like you looking up to me, so I can't let them down.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Heh, the point of this whole thing was to cheer everyone up, and yet I'm the one getting supported here.   
Happy - You know, I think you're the kind of person my sister would've looked up to.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All right, that's enough talking about the past. Let's hurry up and finish clean—   
   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hurt - ...Ngh.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What's wrong?   
Are you hurt?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well, I ran into that group of punks on my way home from shopping today.   
There were even more of 'em this time, and one guy managed to get a good hit in.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Don't worry though. I didn't do anything that would get me in trouble with the police.   
I just let them throw as many punches as they wanted until they got tired and gave up.   
I thought I could dodge them all, but, uh... I guess I've still got room to improve.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I finished cleaning up with Sanada,   
then went back to my room...   
I feel like my  has improved   
after seeing how caring Sanada is...

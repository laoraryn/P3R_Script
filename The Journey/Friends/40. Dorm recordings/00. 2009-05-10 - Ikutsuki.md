...!?
It's the command room. Ikutsuki
is alone, writing something.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Hm... A Shadow in the middle of town... It managed to take over public transportation.
Happy - I should investigate whether this means it's finally begun...

Shuji Ikutsuki
The monorail...

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - I bet this subject would make a good "one-liner"...!

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Hehe... Ahahahaha!
Happy - Oh, I need to note that one down...

Shuji Ikutsuki
Unfortunately, lady luck played a large part in our victory...
Especially toward the end. If he hadn't guessed at the right controls, things could have been very bad.
For Shadows to work in a group to overrun large machines is unprecedented.

Shuji Ikutsuki
The engine...

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - That was an engine-ious move!

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Ahahaha! What is it with me today!? I'm on a roll!
Happy - Ah, better write that one down too...

Shuji Ikutsuki
Angry - Always be prepared for heavy lifting during a mission...

Shuji Ikutsuki
Angry - Because Shadows aren't light!
......

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Whoa, I'm getting a little off-subject... But who cares!?
Hey... I should write all these down and show them off the next time everyone gets together!

Shuji Ikutsuki
Angry - "Don't care for seafood? They also serve GROUND beef!"

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - Hehe... Ahahaha! This has nothing to do with the status report anymore, but I'm having a blast!
Let's see, what else...?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The recording ends here...

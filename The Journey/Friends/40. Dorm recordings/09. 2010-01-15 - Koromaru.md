Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
...!?   
It's the third floor lounge.   
Koromaru's looking this way.   
   
Koromaru   
Ruff!   
   
Fuuka's Voice   
Speaking of, career counseling is coming up.   
   
Yukari's Voice   
Yeah. What are we even supposed to talk about the whole time?   
   
Koromaru   
Woof!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, Koro-chan.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You're gonna get sick if you go sleeping anywhere you want, you know.   
   
Aigis   
Hm?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
What's up, Aigis?   
   
Aigis   
There's a miniature camera near the ceiling. It's been camouflaged.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Wha!?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
So it's been recording everyone who walks past here?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Oh, yeah... I forgot you can see anywhere in the dorm from the command room.   
   
Aigis   
Does that mean one has been placed in each of our rooms as well?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - I-I never thought about that.   
Sad - But... I think it might. I did use the system last year.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Huh!? I-Is that true!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - W-Well, you need a key to use it, and I doubt any of the guys would have the guts to look in our rooms.   
Sad - ......   
Angry - If they did, Nyx can wait. I'll tear them apart first!   
   
Aigis   
Are you experiencing the psychological breakdown known as "dying of shame"?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - A-Anyway, we don't need that stupid system anymore! Let's ask Mitsuru-senpai to have it removed!   
   
Koromaru   
Woof!   
   
Aigis   
Yes, that's right.   
The camera's recording right now.   
   
Aigis   
Yoo-hoo.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The recording ends here...

...!?
It looks like Yukari's room...

Yukari Takeba
Like this, I guess...?

Yukari Takeba
Happy - "Welcome! I'll be taking care of you today!"
Happy - "Are you ready to order, or do you need a little more time?"

Yukari Takeba
Hmm, it's too bad the school festival got canceled...
I already went to all the trouble of putting this on, so maybe I should wear it around the dorm for the day.
......

Yukari Takeba
Happy - "'Sup, Yuka-tan? Hey, does that mean you gotta call me Master?"

Yukari Takeba
Angry - "What's going on, Takeba? You planning to work at Mitsuru's mansion or something?"
Angry - ......

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Ugh... Forget it.
I've been meaning to return this, but now that I look at it, it's a real uniform, huh? It's not just a costume.
Oh, I should take a picture before I give this back to Senpai.

Fuuka's Voice
Yukari-chan, are you there?
I need your help with something...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Sure, one sec!
Happy - I know! I'll drag Fuuka down with me! At least then I won't be alone in the embarrassment...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Yukari-chan... Those clothes—!

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I've got a couple spares, if you wanna try one on. How about it?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Huh?
Surprised - Um, wait...!

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Don't worry! Just hold still.
Happy - It's a little tricky to put on, so it'll be faster if I help.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Um, wait— Yukari-chan! Eep!

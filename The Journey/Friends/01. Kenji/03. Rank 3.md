Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Despite its simple appearance,
the soup has a complex flavor
that's enhanced by the noodles.

Kenji Tomochika
Sad - Maaan... I'm so sick of this, dude.

Minato Arisato - Selection
What, of ramen?
What, of school?
What, of life?

Kenji Tomochika
Sad - No, not that. Wouldn't be here if I was sick of ramen.

Kenji Tomochika
Exasperated* - Dude, I've been sick of school since day one.

Kenji Tomochika
Exasperated* - Life? Dude, you watch too much reality TV.
Sad - But I guess, yeah, you could say I'm sick of life.

Kenji Tomochika
I mean, I get up, go to school, sit through lame-ass lectures, eat, watch TV, and go to bed.

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - Okay, that settles it, Arisato. I'm gonna get myself a girlfriend! Right now!

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sounds impossible.
Good luck!

Kenji Tomochika
Angry - What're you talking about!? I'm a smooth operator! Smooth as hell!

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - What a cool thing to say! Soon I'll have a girlfriend and be just as cool as you!

Kenji Tomochika
Alright, I think I'm gonna pull the trigger on my secret plan.
I told you about the teacher, right? I'm gonna ask her out and get her to fall in love with me.

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - Her name is Ms. Kanou. You heard of her? She teaches third-year ethics. We get along pretty well.
Happy - She's not mainstream beautiful, but she's really pretty. She's got these cute little eyes, a sexy body...

Kenji Tomochika
Surprised - Uh, don't tell anyone about this, okay? You're the only one who knows.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Tomochika told me more about his plan.
I feel like our relationship is stronger...

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - Dude, I'm getting so psyched! Let's cook up a plan of attack!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Tomochika and I chatted
on the walk home.

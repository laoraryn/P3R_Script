Happy - Another day, another bowl of ramen!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Despite its simple appearance,   
the soup has a complex flavor   
that's enhanced by the noodles.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Damn, this really is some bomb ramen. How could I ever leave this city!?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
......   
Ms. Kanou must be in Kyushu by now. I wonder if she had her wedding already.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
......   
Maybe she did.   
I'm stealing your egg!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Exasperated* - You really don't you have anything to say to me?   
Exasperated* - Nothing inspiring or encouraging?   
Exasperated* - Anything? Dude, you gotta learn when to say the right words if you want to land yourself a girl.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
And you know what else? My favorite show had its finale, and I didn't even notice.   
Happy - My mind was really on one track for a while, huh? Kinda funny in a weird way.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Surprised - Heeey! Dude, give that back!   
Angry - That egg's all I got in this world, man! Hand it over or else!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
We chatted for a while...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Man, it's always a blast hanging out with you. That said... I still want a girlfriend!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You don't know when to give up...   
You've got this!   
Want me to find you a girl?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Hell no! Men and women can't help but be attracted to each other. That's just biology, dude.   
Happy - C'mon, I just dropped some serious knowledge there. See how much I've been studying?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Yeah, dude! And you can be my wingman! Let's go pick up some chicks!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Surprised - Really? Who? Someone from your dorm?   
Happy - Sounds like I should be making more surprise visits.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Surprised - Ah, no, no— I'm getting off track!   
I've been doing some thinking after everything that went down.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
When Emiri left, I was sad, sure. But on top of that, I felt... really dumb.   
Did I really love Emiri, or did I just love the idea of dating a teacher?   
I thought about it a lot.   
......   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
But I couldn't figure it out.   
What I did figure out is... you're a true friend.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
...Are we still talking about love?   
That's right! We're great friends.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Surprised - We're talking about the heart, dude! Don't you feel it? Just shut up and feel it!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Exasperated* - Ugh, dammit! Why do I say such embarrassing things!? God, I'm such a dumbass.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Anyway... Here, take this.

Happy - I made it for you. Figured you could pull it off.   
Happy - Your fashion sense is kinda meh, so I wanted to help you out. I mean, that's what best friends do, right?   
Happy - It's a symbol of our friendship!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Tomochika told me I'm his best friend.   
I feel a strong bond with Tomochika...

The Magician Social Link reached its maximum level! You can now fuse **Futsunushi**, the warrior god!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Exasperated* - Man! I worked up an appetite acting all weird around you!   
Exasperated* - More eggs, please! Make it ten!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Tomochika and I spent hours hanging out.

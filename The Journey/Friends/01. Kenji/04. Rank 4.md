Kenji Tomochika
Hey, thanks for coming, man. You mind waiting here for a sec?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure.
Why?

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - Okay listen, but don't freak out!
Happy - I'm gonna go ask Ms. Kanou out! Like, right now!

Minato Arisato - Selection
Good luck!
Don't do it.
Whatever, man.

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - Thanks, man! Time to go get myself a girlfriend!

Kenji Tomochika
Exasperated* - Don't scare me like that, dude. A little encouragement would be nice.

Kenji Tomochika
Sad - Don't be so cold, dude. I mean, there's still a chance she'll turn me down, right?
Sad - And I'll be way too sad to walk home alone if that happens, y'know? So just hang back a sec!

Kenji Tomochika
Alright, this is it... Here I go!

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - Dude, dude, dude! Oh man, listen to this!
Happy - She said yes! I can't believe it! This is crazy!
Happy - I was just about to ask her out, but then she asked me if I wanted a private lesson!

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - For real, dude, I owe you! I owe you big time for hearing me out!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It sounds like Tomochika's
secret plan went well.
I feel like our relationship is stronger...

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - I'm about to head over to her house. Oh man, I'm not ready for this!
Happy - I shouldn't expect anything too crazy from the get-go, right? Then again, she is an adult, so...

Kenji Tomochika
Oh, Arisato, forgot you were there. Sorry, but I gotta jet!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
......
It's getting dark, so I decided to head home.

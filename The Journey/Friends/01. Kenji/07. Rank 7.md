Sad - You sure you wanna know?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Huh? Oh, yeah, sure. Go ahead.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - I don't think we're gonna get to eat together like this anymore.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
To be honest, something's been on my mind.   
Sad - I saw a magazine in Emiri's room. Guess what it was called.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
In Fashion?   
Occult Living?   
Bride-to-Be?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - Why would I have a problem with that?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
It was a wedding magazine! So it got me thinking...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Surprised - Dude, I wouldn't be going out with her if she was into that!

Kenji Tomochika   
Angry - And I've made up my mind, man. As soon as I graduate high school, I'm gonna marry Emiri.

Congrats!   
You're rushing things.   
Sure, whatever.

Happy tears* - Arisato... Thanks, dude!

Sad - Sorry. I just want you to back me up, y'know...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Tomochika seems dead set on this plan.   
I feel like our relationship is stronger...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
We should get going. I wonder how many more times I'll get to walk home with you like this.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I decided to walk home with Tomochika.

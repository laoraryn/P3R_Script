Exasperated* - Ahh, Arisato.
Exasperated* - Sorry, man, but I've gotta pass this time.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Just like that?
Why?

Kenji Tomochika
Sad - I'm just so torn. I really do wanna hang out with you.

Kenji Tomochika
No... No time for ramen today. I gotta go check out that cram school.

Kenji Tomochika
Sad - I forgot I have to go check out that cram school today. Sorry, man.

Kenji Tomochika
Exasperated* - No time for ramen today.

Kenji Tomochika
Sad - I mean, getting into college is pretty important, don't ya think? You think about the future too, right?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I've got plans already.
Yeah, more than you do.
Not even a little.

Kenji Tomochika
Surprised - Whoa, dude! I didn't know you were so serious about your future!

Kenji Tomochika
Angry - Whaaat? You don't need to be a dick about it.

Kenji Tomochika
Surprised - Dude, are you for real!? You gotta take this seriously!

Kenji Tomochika
I never really thought about my future until Emiri told me I should. She said I'd end up a loser if I didn't.
Sad - But the future's a long way off. I mean, I still have to go to college first, right?

Kenji Tomochika
Sad - Apparently a bunch of Emiri's students go to good colleges.
Sad - She must be thinking about our future together...

Kenji Tomochika
You oughta think about your future too, man. I'd hate to see you end up becoming a loser, y'know?
Happy - That's why we gotta work our asses off! For our futures!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Tomochika seemed to be sincerely
worried about my future...
I feel like our relationship is stronger...

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - Later, Arisato! I'm heading to cram school!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I went back to the dorm by myself.

Happy - But yeah, Emiri is— Oh, that's Ms. Kanou's first name. Anyway, Emiri's really popular with the guys.
Happy - And I kinda took her away from them, y'know? Like, she became my girl before they even had a chance.

Kenji Tomochika
Turns out Emiri's a really strict teacher when it comes to grades.
Happy - At home, though, she's a real sweetheart! I love how her attitude changes when she's with me...

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - Yeah, good-looking people just flock together, y'know? It's like a law of attraction.

Minato Arisato - Selection
...Is that so?
Okay...
Good-looking, huh?

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - Aw, hey, I didn't mean to hit a nerve! C'mon, don't worry. We're still gonna hang out, alright?

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - I know, right!? It's like we're actually in a TV show!

Kenji Tomochika
Sad - Hey, I'm just messing around, man! Don't take me so seriously!
Well, Emiri is pretty gorgeous...

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - Anyway, what about you, Arisato? Make any progress with Takeba-san?
Happy - I feel guilty hogging all the happiness, so I'm gonna wish for you to be happy, too.

Kenji Tomochika
Surprised - And hey, don't tell anyone about me and Emiri, okay? 'Cause teachers aren't allowed to date students.
Happy - I only told you because I trust you.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Tomochika really trusts me...
I feel like our relationship is stronger...

Kenji Tomochika
Shoot, look at the time. I'm way behind on my favorite show.
Happy - Well, I guess that's because real life is way better than any show right now.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I don't think Tomochika's ever
going to stop talking...
I ended the conversation at
a good spot and went home.

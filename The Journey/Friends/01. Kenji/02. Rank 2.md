Happy - Man, this always hits the spot. This flavor's pretty addictive, huh?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Despite its simple appearance,   
the soup has a complex flavor   
that's enhanced by the noodles.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
By the way, dude, why the hell is your dorm co-ed?   
Happy - Can you, like, just waltz on into Takeba-san's room and stuff?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Of course.   
No way.   
That's a secret.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Angry - O-Of course!? Well, I mean, it's not that crazy!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Yeah, that's what I thought. Can't win 'em all, I suppose.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Secret? Yeah, sure, the only secret is that nothing is going on between you two.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Well, I'm not interested in girls her age, anyway.   
I'm more into older women. How 'bout you?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'm into older women, too.   
I prefer girls my age.   
I like them all!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - No way! Really!? Not a lotta guys out there who feel the same way!   
Happy - Man, you're cooler than I thought!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Exasperated* - Psh, you don't know what you're missing, man.   
Older women are smart, sexy, and sophisticated.   
Exasperated* - Damn, dude. I thought you'd understand.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Surprised - Really? So you don't discriminate, huh?   
Happy - Interesting, interesting. That's an impressive lifestyle, man.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - To tell you the truth—and this stays between us—I have my eye on someone.   
Happy - This is the "secret plan" I was talking about. Basically, I'm just gonna ask this girl out.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - But get this—she's a teacher at our school.   
Happy - Not like that's gonna stop me from making my move. But you gotta promise you won't tell anyone, okay?   
Happy - It might look weird if a teacher and a student are having a thing, y'know?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Tomochika told me his secret plan.   
I feel like our relationship is stronger...

Surprised - Oh, crap! My favorite show's about to start! See ya!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I parted ways with Tomochika   
and went back to the dorm.

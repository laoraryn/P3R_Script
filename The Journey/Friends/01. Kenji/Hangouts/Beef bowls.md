Happy - Damn, that was good. How do they even make it that good?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Well, dude... I've made up my mind.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
That was the last beef bowl I'm ever gonna eat!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
......   
Why?   
Don't be an idiot.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Think about it, dude. I can't be going out for beef bowls when I'm dating an adult woman like Emiri.   
I've given this a lotta thought, man... So don't try to talk me out of it.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Tomochika looks lovestruck...   
I learned a little more about him today.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Hehe, curious?   
Happy - Well, I gotta be more "adult" now that I'm with Emiri, so I decided that's what I'm gonna do.   
Happy - Pretty cool, huh?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Tomochika is explaining excitedly.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - C'mon, dude, I'm serious! At least ask me why!   
Sad - I'm trying to be more "adult" now that I'm with Emiri. I guess you wouldn't understand...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Tomochika seems disappointed...   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
I guess I should think about my wardrobe, too. I better get a magazine on the way back.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
After going to the bookstore, I saw   
Tomochika off and returned to the dorm.

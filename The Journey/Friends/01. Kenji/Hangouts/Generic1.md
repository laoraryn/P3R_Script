Kenji Tomochika
Sad - Thanks for coming, dude. I tend to get lost in my own head when I'm alone.

Kenji Tomochika
I still haven't heard from Emiri. I think she's ignoring me...
Sad - *sigh*

Kenji Tomochika
Sad - ...You know how there's been a lot of talk about Apathy Syndrome lately?
Sad - Maybe I caught it or something...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Maybe you're right.
No, you didn't.
You shouldn't worry about it.

Kenji Tomochika
Sad - It makes sense, right? I never feel like doing anything, and I'm always bummed out...
Sad - I don't want to give up on Emiri, but I just don't know what else to do...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Tomochika continues to sigh...
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Kenji Tomochika
...Yeah, maybe not.
Those eyes they have are kinda freaky. I was kinda wondering if I look like that...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Tomochika seems relieved...
I learned a little more about him today.

Kenji Tomochika
Yeah, you're right, dude. I have to snap outta this...
Happy - I should be thinking about my future with her... Thanks, man.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Tomochika seems like he's doing better...
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - Well, whatever happens from here on, you'll be the first to hear about it.
Happy - Guess I'll start saving up some money... If you know of any good jobs around here, let me know.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After talking with Tomochika for a bit,
I decided to go back to the dorm.

Happy - Dude, I just got the greatest plan from that manga I was reading!
Happy - I'm totally gonna get Ms. Kanou this way. Ya wanna hear it? Huh? Do ya? Ya know ya do!

Kenji Tomochika
Okay, so this is what I'm gonna say to her...
Sad - "Hey, Ms. Kanou... I'm having a really hard time with this problem..."

Kenji Tomochika
And then she'll be like...
Happy - "Oh, don't worry, Tomochika-kun. I'm here to help you. Just you leave everything to me..."

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - Well? Whaddaya think? Perfect plan, right?

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's not gonna work.
Yeah, it's perfect!
I've got a better plan...

Kenji Tomochika
Sad - Man, why do you gotta be such a downer? It totally worked in the manga...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Tomochika seems disappointed...
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - I know, right!? It's totally gonna work!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Tomochika seems excited.
I learned a little more about him today.

Kenji Tomochika
Surprised - Whoa, serious!? Man, you're a good guy to have around.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Tomochika seems very excited.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - Alright, let's continue our research so that I get my happily ever after!
Happy - I'm counting on you, dude. If you come up with something good, I'll buy you dinner or something.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I parted ways with Tomochika
and went back to the dorm.

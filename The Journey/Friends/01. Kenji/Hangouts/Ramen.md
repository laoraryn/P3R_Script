Kenji Tomochika
Hey, sorry to ask you to hang out all of a sudden.
The rest of my family's out today. Kinda didn't want to eat all by my lonesome, y'know?
That's when I remembered you eating ramen like it was your favorite thing ever! Great minds, yo.

Kenji Tomochika
I don't trust guys that don't enjoy their food.
I mean, it's one thing if the food's really nasty.
Happy - Then there's those guys that pretend it's good even if they don't like it. Can't trust them either.

Kenji Tomochika
By the way, are you picky about your food?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'm pretty picky.
Not at all.
I refuse to eat certain things.

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - Heh, me too.
Happy - I just can't stomach probably like half the food in the world. I don't even consider them edible.
Happy - Oh, but if a gorgeous girl was the one cooking, I might be able to. That's different, y'know?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Tomochika seems to sympathize with me.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Kenji Tomochika
Yikes, you serious? You must be overly forgiving...
I just can't stand some stuff, personally.
Like vegetables. They're pretty much just leaves. I'm not a bug, ya know...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Tomochika sighs.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - Oh, I totally hear ya! There are just some things that make you wanna scream, "This ain't food!"
I mean, mushrooms are just fungus, right? Seafood's kinda pushin' the limits too...
And I hate stuff like ginger and beefsteak plants. Why in the world would you eat roots and leaves?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Tomochika seems to sympathize with me.
I learned a little more about him today.

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - Well, now I know what your taste in food is like. Next up: what type of girl do you like?
Happy - You into the cute type or the sexy model type? Long hair or short?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After Tomochika's interrogation,
I decided to return to the dorm.

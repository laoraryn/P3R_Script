Sad - Hey, uh, about last time... I looked like a complete idiot, huh?

Kenji Tomochika
So, um... You know...

Kenji Tomochika
Can you just... forget that ever happened?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure.
Of course not.
Forget what happened?

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - Heh, thanks, dude!
When I try to sleep, I keep remembering how I acted then, and it makes me want to scream...
Happy - I haven't gotten over it yet, but... for now, I just wanna forget about it!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Tomochika seems relieved...
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Kenji Tomochika
Sad - Oh...
Well... I guess if it's just my best friend who saw me at my lowest, that's not so bad...
Sad - ...Nah, actually, screw that, dude.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Tomochika's smile looks forced...
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Kenji Tomochika
Surprised - Oh, nothing! If you don't remember, then don't worry about it!
Happy - End of conversation!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Tomochika seems relieved...
I learned a little more about him today.

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - Man, talking so much is giving me an appetite again.
Happy - Maybe I've gotten back to my usual groove! Anyways, you should eat some more, too.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The two of us hung out for a while before
I decided to go back to the dorm.

Sad - Dude... That movie was friggin' terrible...
Sad - Was that supposed to be a comedy or something?

Kenji Tomochika
Surprised - Um...
Surprised - Just so you know, I really do have a girlfriend. It's not like we never hang out or anything.

Kenji Tomochika
Emiri just always wants me to go to her house...
But I really want to take her out to dinner somewhere or something.

Kenji Tomochika
Sad - Hmm... Maybe it's because of that Apathy Syndrome thing that's going around.
Sad - Maybe she's scared of catching it... Is it contagious?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, it is.
No, it's not.
I don't know.

Kenji Tomochika
Surprised - Seriously!? Dude, what are we even doing here, then!?
Sad - We gotta stay inside or we could catch it! Damn, that's scary to think about...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Tomochika seems very worried...
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Kenji Tomochika
Happy - Oh, good. So, if I let her know, then she'll probably let me take her out somewhere, right...?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Tomochika seems relieved...
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Kenji Tomochika
Exasperated* - Yeah, I guess you wouldn't know either. Nobody really knows that much about it, huh?
I can't really blame Emiri for being worried...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Tomochika looks a little grim...
I learned a little more about him today.

Kenji Tomochika
If we go out on a date, it should be somewhere with less people around, just in case...
Maybe I'll get a magazine to find some places like that. Mind if we stop at a bookstore?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After the bookstore, I decided
to go back to the dorm.

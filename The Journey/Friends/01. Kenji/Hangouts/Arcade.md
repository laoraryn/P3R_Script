Happy - Dude, I'm a dancing machine! Someday, I'm gonna get the high score!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Surprised - Hey, so, uh...   
Totally changing the subject, but... I need to ask you something.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
D-Don't laugh, okay...? But, uh, I wanted to know if, um... if you've ever kissed a girl before...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I have.   
I haven't.   
Yeah, tons of times.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Surprised - Y-Yeah, of course, that's what I thought. I just, you know, had to ask.   
Sad - I mean, I don't wanna hang around someone who's never even kissed a girl before. Haha...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Tomochika seems a little sad...   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Surprised - Wait, really? Wow, dude, I totally would've thought you had...   
Happy - I mean, it's no big deal or anything. It's not like I've ever kissed a girl before, either.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Tomochika seems happy about something...   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Surprised - Whoa, seriously?   
Surprised - Wow, dude... I didn't know you were such a playa...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Tomochika seems impressed...   
I learned a little more about him today.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
...Sorry. That was a weird question, huh? Let's just forget about it.   
Happy - So, where to next? Wanna go check out the CDs?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The two of us hung out for a while longer   
before I decided to go back to the dorm.

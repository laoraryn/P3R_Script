Hey, dude! Let's grab some seats up front!   
   
Refugee Woman   
Ahh! They're all over the third floor already! This is it... We're gonna die here!   
   
Refugee Man   
Stay calm! We can't give up now! There's always hope, no matter how damned the world is!   
   
Refugee Man   
As god as my witness, I won't die in this mall!

Watching the humans fight for survival

Kenji Tomochika   
Oh, man! My hands were sweating like crazy. Everything was so well done.   
But dude, three movies in a row is way too much. Anyway, it's getting dark, so let's bounce.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I parted ways with Tomochika

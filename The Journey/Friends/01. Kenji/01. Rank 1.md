Happy - Yo, what's up?   
Hey man, I'm gonna get some ramen after school. You wanna come?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Why are you asking me?   
Why so out of the blue?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - No reason, really. Just don't have anything to do later.   
Happy - Plus I figured we could finish our chat from this morning.   
Happy - So how 'bout it, man? Let's get some ramen at the mall and talk.

I'm going to hang out with   
my classmate after school.   
According to Igor, the strength of a   
Social Link is the strength of a Persona.   
...I decided to go with him.

Kenji Tomochika   
Whew! Now that's what I'm talkin' about!   
Well, was I right, or was I right? The soup here tastes great, doesn't it?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Angry - They've gotta put some special ingredient in it—something no other ramen shop would ever use.   
Sad - Maybe there's a secret clue in the shop's name...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Ah, my bad.   
I always geek out a little whenever I eat here.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I know what you mean.   
Just shut up and eat.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
You do? Really? You taste the magic, too?   
Man, wasn't expecting that. I think I'm liking you more by the minute.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Ah, yeah man, you're right. The noodles'll get soggy if we talk too long.   
It's just... the way you're savoring your soup, it seems like you really appreciate its flavor.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
By the way, I hear you and Takeba-san are pretty close.   
Damn, and you just transferred here, too!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Well, I can't blame you. A man's gotta be aggressive in this day and age.   
Hey, let's hang out after school again sometime. Lemme know when you're free.   
Happy - I'll tell you all about my secret plan. Dude, you're gonna flip when you hear it!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Kenji Tomochika seems to   
have taken a liking to me.   
...!?   
A voice is ringing inside my head...

Surprised - What, it's already dark? Damn, I missed my favorite show!   
Exasperated* - Man, for real...? Oh, well, let's get going.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Ah, but first, let's swap numbers. Bust out that cell phone!

I decided to return to the dorm.

Listen well, Minato-dono!
Happy - I have come up with a great idea to get my uncle to appreciate Japan's charm!

Bebe
Happy - I will show him a kimono! When he sees it, he will understand the beauty of Nihon!

Minato Arisato - Selection
Will that be enough?
That's a great idea.

Bebe
Sad - You of all people still have doubts?
Angry - Don't worry! Even if my back is to the wall, I will make him understand!

Bebe
Happy - Oui! With you in my corner, I have nothing to fear!

Bebe
Happy - The kimono is a Japanese treasure, full of culture and history!
Happy - If I show it to my uncle, he will surely let me stay in Nihon.

Bebe
As for the design...

Bebe
Happy - It will be inspired by the mascot of Azuki Arai! Simple, but deep!
I choose this design because, well...

Bebe
Happy - You are the one who took me there!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Bebe really seems to trust me.
I feel like we're growing closer...

Bebe
I can see everything clearly now!

Bebe
Happy - I shall hurry and make the kimono!

Bebe
Happy - I must sew! Sew like the wind!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I spent the day working with Bebe,
then went back to the dorm.

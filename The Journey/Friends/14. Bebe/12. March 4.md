André... Laurent... Jean... Geraux?

Too long! A samurai's name should be simple and short!

...Oh, Arisato.
This letter was sent to the school. It looks like it's addressed to one of our students...
...Wait, is this actually for you? The writing's so shaky, I didn't recognize your name.
It's from an André... something. I don't recall a student with such a foreign name.
The only one that comes to mind is Bebe...

The sender's name is listed as
André Laurent Jean Geraux...
It's from Bebe... I should read this letter.

Letter from Bebe
"Hello, Minato-dono.
It is me, Bebe."

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Bebe's unsteady scribbles
fill the page...
I can picture Bebe's smiling face.

Letter from Bebe
"Writing in your language is difficult, so forgive me if it is hard to read."
"I learned a lot in Japan, but I still need lots of help."
"I write this with a dictionary."

Letter from Bebe
"I showed Uncle the kimono. He said many wonderful things about it."
"He said Japan is a great country. I was thrilled to hear it!"

Letter from Bebe
"So I tell Uncle that I want to go back to Japan."
"I tell him over and over. Finally he says, 'Okay!'"

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can really feel Bebe's joy
coming through in his letter.

Letter from Bebe
"But I decided not to go back."
"I am sorry, Minato-dono. I said I would come back, but it was a lie."

Letter from Bebe
"I didn't know."
"My aunt was not the only one who helped me study abroad."
"Uncle, relatives, neighbors... So many people helped me."

Letter from Bebe
"They all wanted me to go back. They said they would help pay for it."
"But Uncle is sad after he lost my aunt."

Letter from Bebe
"While Uncle grieves, I would not be able to enjoy myself in Japan."
"I cannot take everyone's money for my own fun."

Letter from Bebe
"Besides, I can learn about Japan here in France, too."
"And so, in France I will stay."
"Someday, I will return to Japan on my own, without anyone's help."

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can feel the determination
in Bebe's words.

Letter from Bebe
"I reflected on how fun it was to make clothes with you, Minato-dono, so I enrolled in fashion school."
"I made some clothes for the school contest, and I won first prize!"
"I have come up with a name for my winning design."

Letter from Bebe
"'Minato'... A very wonderful name, I think."
"It is a name that means a lot to me."
"Japan and France, Minato-dono and me... All so far apart."

Letter from Bebe
"But I am always here for you. No amount of distance will ever change that."
"Every day was so much fun. More fun than I've ever had."

Letter from Bebe
"I hope I get to see you again someday."
"To my precious friend, Minato-dono
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Bebe"

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The words near the end are smudged...

Happy - Today, our work is done—fini!   
Say, Minato-dono! Could we go to the tea shop, Azuki Arai, together?   
It will be my first time going. Will you maybe, how do you say, show me the ropes?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure, let's go.   
You like sweets?   
There's nothing to show.   
   
Bebe   
Happy - Ohhh! You are my hero! Katajikenai!   
   
Bebe   
Happy - Japanese sweets are très oishii—delicious!   
Happy - The flavors are simple but perfect. Japanese culture is so fascinating—omoshiroi!   
   
Bebe   
Surprised - There isn't!?   
Sad - What a relief... I was afraid I might offend someone if I did not know the proper etiquette.   
   
Bebe   
Happy - D'accord, let's be off, then!   
   
Bebe   
Happy - We'll go together, my tomodachi!

The azuki desserts here are amazing. Red bean is so oishii!   
Happy - I love the culture of Nihon! Japan is sugoi—amazing!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I totally agree.   
What about your country?   
It's not that great.   
   
Bebe

Bebe   
I have an aunt who lives back home. She has been helping me.   
Happy - I have to tell her that I've made a wonderful new tomodachi!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Bebe seems really grateful.   
I feel like we're growing closer...   
   
Bebe   
Surprised - Ohh, look at the time!   
Sad - But I wanted to ask you more about Nihon... I must dream a bit longer, I suppose.   
   
Bebe

I parted ways with Bebe

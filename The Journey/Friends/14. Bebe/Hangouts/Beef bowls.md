Happy - Umiushi Bowl... Truly a one-of-a-kind delicacy! So very oishii!

Bebe
Happy - The meat goes so well with the rice! A combination that brings out both flavors!

Bebe
Speaking of rice... What is your favorite dish with it, Minato-dono?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I don't eat rice.
Ochazuke.
Curry.

Bebe
Angry - Honto!? Really!? What a shame. How can you be Japanese and not eat rice?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Bebe seems offended.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Bebe
Happy - Ah yes! Green tea over rice, ochazuke! A Japanese staple!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Bebe seems very happy.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Bebe
That is also an excellent dish!
But I think ochazuke is the best. A simple dish, just green tea over rice, but a Japanese staple!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Bebe seems happy.
I learned a little more about him today.

Bebe
Of course, I plan to have rice for dinner as well! Nothing beats ochazuke!
But first, I must buy some tea. Will you accompany me?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After shopping with Bebe,
I returned to the dorm.

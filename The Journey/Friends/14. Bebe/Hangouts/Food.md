Bebe
So delicious! Ah, this must be true bliss!

Bebe
Angry - Still, I cannot help but feel anxious...

Bebe
Angry - Perhaps this is not the time to obsess over food.
Angry - I must hurry and complete the kimono.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Go finish it now.
Patience.
Just relax.

Bebe
Angry - I do not have a sewing machine at my house! I must endure until we are able to return to school!
Angry - A true samurai must persevere through whatever life may throw at them!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Bebe looks anxious.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Bebe
You are right! A true samurai must persevere through whatever life may throw at them!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Bebe seems motivated...
I learned a little more about him today...

Bebe
Surprised - "Relax," you say!?
Happy - ...Yes, of course, of course! Rushing will not help! I must keep my composure and relax!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Bebe seems very motivated...
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Bebe
That reminds me... There is a wise Japanese proverb for this very occasion.
You cannot fight on an empty stomach! So now I eat, and eat I shall!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After enjoying a meal together,
I headed back to the dorm.

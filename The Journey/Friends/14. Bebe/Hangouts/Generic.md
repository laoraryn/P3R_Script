Bebe
Thank you for coming with me. I think I feel a bit better now...
Sad - ......
Sad - *sigh*

Bebe
Sad - I used to call my aunt on the weekend and on holidays...
Sad - If she was still alive, I would call her today...

Bebe
Sad - Perhaps I am feeling homesick...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Are you going back?
You should stay in Japan.
Will you go to the funeral?

Bebe
Angry - That is something I hope to avoid.
Sad - Since my aunt is no longer there to support my studying abroad, I fear I will not be able to return here...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Bebe seems devastated.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Bebe
Happy - That is exactly what I intend to do!
Since my aunt is no longer there to support my studying abroad, I fear I will not be able to return here...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Bebe looks delighted.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Bebe
Happy - Oh, you are thinking of my aunt? Thank you very much! Arigato! You are very kind!
I do wish to attend the funeral... But I cannot go back at this time.
Since my aunt is no longer there to support my studying abroad, I fear I will not be able to return here...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Bebe looks happy.
I learned a little more about him today.

Bebe
Ah, my aunt will be turning in her grave if I stay like this any longer.
Happy - I will go home and put myself to work at the sewing machine. Thank you for today, Minato-dono.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I saw Bebe off before returning to the dorm.

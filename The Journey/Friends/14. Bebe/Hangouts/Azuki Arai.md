Happy - Oishii! That was very delicious!

Bebe
Happy - Japanese sweets do a great job showing the appeal of sugar.

Bebe
Azuki, though small, is packed with such divine flavor...
What exactly is it? It just looks like the eggs of an insect to me.

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'm not sure.
It IS insect eggs.
It's beans.

Bebe
Sad - Not even you know, Minato-dono?
Sad - This is quite problématique then—very puzzling indeed. Perhaps we will never discover the truth...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Bebe looks troubled.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Bebe
Surprised - Honto!? Really!? Do you mean to say that my guess was correct!?
Happy - Once again, I have learned something new about Japan!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Bebe seems happy.
I learned a little more about him today...

Bebe
Surprised - Beans!? You mean to tell me something so red and soft is a bean!?
Happy - I have once again learned something new about Japan!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Bebe seems very happy.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Bebe
So then the secret to Japanese sweets must be hidden within the azuki...
Where would I be able to buy some? Come, let us search for azuki, Minato-dono!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After shopping with Bebe,
I returned to the dorm.

Happy - That was so much fun! Very tanoshi!   
   
Bebe   
Sad - But... I thought we would be playing more traditional games?   
   
Bebe   
Sad - Like where you fly a kite? Takoage? Or spin a top like in komamawashi?   
Sad - Does no one play those games anymore?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
We do on New Year's.   
Nope, not anymore.   
I dunno.   
   
Bebe   
Surprised - What!? You only play these games on New Year's? I did not know...   
Happy - But now I have learned something new about Japan!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Bebe looks at me with admiration.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Bebe   
Surprised - Honto!? Really!?   
Sad - That is so sad... Yet another Japanese tradition lost to time!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Bebe looks disappointed...   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Bebe   
Sad - You are not sure either, Minato-dono? Then perhaps the tradition has died out...   
Sad - It is so sad to see Japanese traditions fade away and disappear like that!   
Happy - I will take part in them at once! That way, everyone can see how great these traditions are!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Bebe seems determined.   
I learned a little more about him today.   
   
Bebe   
But... now that I think about it, the games in the arcade were all made in Japan as well.   
Surprised - Meaning they are also games of Japan... Perhaps they are even new Japanese traditions!   
   
Bebe   
Surprised - To think it took me this long to realize that... I must go back and confirm this!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
After we were done playing arcade games,   
I decided to head back to the dorm.

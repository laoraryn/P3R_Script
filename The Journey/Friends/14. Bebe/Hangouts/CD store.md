Happy - I bought a CD with traditional Japanese folk songs!
Happy - These songs are simple, yes, but they are rich with the history of their region of origin!

Bebe
Ah, speaking of music in Japan...
I love the sound crickets make. It is very soothing and very melodic.

Bebe
Do you like it, too, Minato-dono?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, I do.
I don't, actually.
It's okay.

Bebe
Happy - Just as I thought! Crickets are indeed an international sensation, a global hit!
Happy - I would very much like my aunt to get the opportunity to hear these crickets...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Bebe is singing merrily.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Bebe
Sad - Oh my! The sound is not to your liking? How sad...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Bebe seems disappointed.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Bebe
"Okay"? It is only okay? Then you must know of a sound that is even better! Hmmm...
Happy - Perhaps nightingales? Or maybe bamboo fountains or cicadas? Japan does have many sounds that are soothing to the ear!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Bebe seems impressed.
I learned a little more about him today...

Bebe
I just had a great idea... I will collect all the beautiful sounds of Japan and send them to my aunt!
Now I must purchase a cassette tape to record these sounds. Come, Minato-dono!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After shopping with Bebe,
I returned to the dorm.

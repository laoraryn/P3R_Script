Yuko Nishiwaki
Oh, I forgot to mention. During lunch break today, that girl was trying to bother me again.
You remember, right? She's the one who put gum on my shoe locker.
Angry - Well this time, I told her what I thought right to her face. That she should find what she really wants to do in life.

Yuko Nishiwaki
She probably didn't get what I was saying, but ever since I figured it out for myself, I feel like I've been able to see the bigger picture.
Happy - I mean, I kinda used to be the same as her, you know? I guess I've learned how to empathize better now.
Not to mention, you did end up becoming my boyfriend, so...

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - But uh, that's not what why I invited you here!
I guess I could've told you this next part at school, but I wanted to talk somewhere quiet.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Is it that important?
What is it?

Yuko Nishiwaki
Hmmm, sort of? Oh, but it's not serious or anything.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Surprised - D-Don't be so impatient! I'm getting to that. Oh, why am I the one panicking now...?

Yuko Nishiwaki
So you know the kids we coached?
Happy - They each left a message for us.
Happy - I know they were kind of a handful, but they also have an endearing side to them, don't you think?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah.
Not really.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Oh, Arisato-kun, you're so sweet.
Sometimes I can't believe how open-minded you are... I think I need to learn from you.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Hahaha, that's pretty harsh.
Happy - But I know you were always looking out for them. I think you'd make a pretty good coach, actually.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Here, this one's for you.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I got (ITEM NAME)!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - The kids told me to "give it to my boyfriend"... Aren't they cute?
Happy - That's what I invited you here for.
......
Well, actually, that was just an excuse.
Sad - Because today... Well, my parents aren't home, so...

Minato Arisato - Selection
I see.
What does that mean?

Yuko Nishiwaki
Y-Yeah. So, um...

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - ...I-I just mean, you can stretch out and relax! We won't get yelled at for being too noisy. H-Haha...

Yuko Nishiwaki
Surprised - D-Don't make me say it! I am a girl, you know...

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - H-Hey, don't stare so much. I know my face is all red...

Yuko Nishiwaki
It's just... I was able to find my true calling thanks to you, Arisato-kun.
Happy - ...I'm so glad I met you.
Happy - Those are my true feelings, and I hope you feel the same.
So, will you stay with me awhile longer?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yuko has expressed her love for me.

The Strength Social Link reached its maximum level! You can now fuse **Atavaka**, the wisdom king general!

Yuko Nishiwaki
I... love you.
Happy - I really do.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I shared a special evening with Yuko.

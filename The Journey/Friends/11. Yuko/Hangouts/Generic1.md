Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Ahh, finally... I'm glad we made time to hang out instead of settling for rushed hellos between classes.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Nice threads, Arisato-kun. You got some pretty good taste.
Sad - Unlike Kaz, who just wears his track jacket everywhere... Embarrassing, honestly. You gotta have clothes that aren't school swag.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Take me, for example. How's my outfit?

Minato Arisato - Selection
It's cute on you.
You look mature.
It's pretty slick.

Yuko Nishiwaki
...You think it's cute, huh?
Maybe it's just me, but getting called "cute" feels a little patronizing.
Happy - But I know you don't mean it like that, so I'll take it as a compliment.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yuko looks kind of embarrassed...
I learned a little more about her today.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Angry - ...Arisato-kun, what the heck are you talking about?
Angry - What do I look like, a grandma? Geez, you'd think I was wearing a pantsuit... "Mature"...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yuko seems upset.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Yuko Nishiwaki
Surprised - For real? Do you mean that?

Yuko Nishiwaki
Surprised - I mean, I'm not gonna tell you you're wrong or anything, but...
Happy - I guess I don't usually hang around people who say nice things to each other off the cuff... Thanks!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yuko seems really happy.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Let's wander around a little more and find a bite to eat. But... let's not get takoyaki.
Happy - Nothing ruins an outfit like a big flake of seaweed stuck in your teeth.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We hung out for a while longer
before going our separate ways.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Phew... It was pretty crowded in there, huh?
Sad - I wanted to give the punching machine a try, but the line's gotten so long I'd rather not...
Let's come back when it's less packed—


Yuko Nishiwaki
Oh my gosh...

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Look! It's so cute! Plus... we might be able to get it in one shot.
Happy - It's been a while since the last time I've played. I may not look it, but I'm pretty good at these.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Surprised - H-Huh...? I couldn't grab it at all...
Angry - What!? No way! That's such bull! This has to be rigged or something!

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's just calm down first.
Man, you suck.
Want me to give it a shot?

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Oh. Yeah. Right.
If grabbing it doesn't work... I'll just have to slowly shift its position till it drops.

Yuko Nishiwaki
It's kind of a pain, but slow and steady wins the race.
Same thing with sports, right? People who are dedicated to training become world-class athletes.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Oh... Kinda went on a tangent there. Anyway, let's give this another shot!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yuko seems motivated.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Angry - No, I don't! It's the friggin' claw! It's too weak!
Sad - Ugh... Guess I just have to slowly adjust the position till it falls.

Yuko Nishiwaki
In the end, slow and steady wins the race... even though it's a total drag.
But it's the same with sports. People who are dedicated to training become world-class athletes.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - ...But that doesn't matter right now. All right, time to win this thing!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yuko looks serious...
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Yuko Nishiwaki
Surprised - Huh? Oh, thanks for the offer, but don't worry.
Happy - If I just keep nudging it in the right direction... I should be able to knock it down.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Kind of a pain, but slow and steady wins the race, y'know?
Same thing with sports. People who are dedicated to training become world-class athletes.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Anyway, time to put my game face on. I'll keep at it until I win this thing...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yuko seems really focused.
I learned a little more about her today.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - Well, at least I got it in the end...
Sad - But I'm so tired now... I've definitely run out of stamina and money.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - Let's head back, Arisato-kun. I need to eat dinner and recuperate.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After saying goodbye to Yuko,
I headed back to the dorm.

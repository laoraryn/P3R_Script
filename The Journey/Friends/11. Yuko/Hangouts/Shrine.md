Yuko Nishiwaki
There's been a lot of talk lately about that Apathy Syndrome stuff...

Yuko Nishiwaki
But I'm sure it won't affect those kids one bit. They're so excited about the race, you know?
Happy - They're pretty amazing kids...

Yuko Nishiwaki
I'm a little envious... since I don't really have anything I'm passionate about.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Don't give up yet.
You'll find something.
You're amazing too.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Angry - Huh? Where'd that come from? I haven't given up. I just haven't found the right thing for me yet, that's all.
Sad - Sorry... You were just trying to cheer me up, right?
Sad - What is with me today? Maybe I'm just nervous because the kids' race is coming up...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yuko suddenly fell silent.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Y-You really think so? Thanks. Hearing that from you makes me feel a little better...
Happy - I've just been so busy as team manager and as a coach for those kids... Not that I mind, of course.
Happy - I don't have much free time these days, but... I dunno, it feels really... fulfilling, you know?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yuko seems very happy.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Aw, c'mon... You're giving me way too much credit here.
Happy - But it does sound pretty cool to say that I'm both a team manager and a coach.
Happy - I'll tell you what... If those kids win their big race, then you can sing my praises.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yuko looks a little embarrassed.
I learned a little more about her today.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Okay, I think I'll pray for a little luck. I just want those kids to show how hard they've practiced.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - So, uh... if you don't mind, do you wanna visit the shrine with me?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After praying at the shrine with Yuko,
I decided to head back to the dorm.

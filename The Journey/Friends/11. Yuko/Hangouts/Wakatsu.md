Yuko Nishiwaki   
...You can have mine if you're still hungry.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
D-Don't worry. I'm not feeling sick or anything like that...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Hey, Arisato-kun, you got some sauce around your mouth.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Oh, thanks.   
It's fine.   
Will you wipe it off for me?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - You're welcome.   
...Aren't ya gonna wipe it off? It's kinda bugging me.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko seems to be enjoying herself.   
I learned a little more about her today.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Really? It's pretty obvious, you know?   
C'mon, wipe yourself up. Here's a napkin...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko looks a little exasperated.   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
You're more childish than you let on, Arisato-kun.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Okay, fine. Here, I'll get it for you...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko is blushing.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - ...The meals here are pretty well balanced nutrition-wise.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
They're low in fat and the side dishes help you get the vitamins and minerals you need...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Hey, Arisato-kun, you got some sauce around your mouth.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Oh, thanks.   
It's fine.   
It's a fashion statement.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - No problem.   
...Aren't ya gonna wipe it off? It's kinda bugging me.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts

Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Oh no it's not. Wanna check yourself in a mirror?   
Happy - You look like you've got a mustache or something. Kinda like some old, wise man, haha...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko is laughing at how I look.   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Uh-huh, totally. It's all the rage these days...   
Happy - Yeah, right! Haha... C'mon, wipe yourself off.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko seems to be enjoying herself.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, hey, since we're already at the strip mall, maybe I'll stop by the bookstore on my way home.   
Happy - ...What? You surprised? Haha, well, yeah, I admit I'm not really the bookish type.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
After Yuko headed to the bookstore,   
I decided to head back to the dorm.

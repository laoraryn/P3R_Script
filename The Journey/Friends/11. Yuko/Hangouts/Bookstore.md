Yuko Nishiwaki
Thanks for coming to the bookstore with me today.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - But still, can't believe I'm buying books for studying, of all things.
Happy - Who would've thought the day would come, am I right?

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - I must be in my prime!

Minato Arisato - Selection
Hopefully.
Definitely.
This is only the beginning.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Well, either way, I better keep this up.
Maybe I'll start with the subjects I'm not so good at today. I'm feeling real motivated for some reason.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yuko seems to be taking this seriously.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Yeah. I gotta do everything I can.
Happy - Usually, I can't stay motivated, so I end up quitting... But not this time!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yuko seems to be enjoying herself.
I learned a little more about her today.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - You're right. We're still teenagers.
Happy - I've still got a long road ahead of me. Thanks, Arisato-kun!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yuko seems impressed by what I said.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Thinking hard while surrounded by books this whole time is kinda making me hungry.
Happy - Let's grab a snack from somewhere. Maybe something sweet?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After getting something to eat with
Yuko, I decided to return to the dorm.

Happy - Straighten your back! And don't forget to swing your arms!   
   
Meek-Looking Girl   
Coach! Guess what, guess what! I beat Yuki-chan!   
I swung my arms really hard, just like you said!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Wow, seriously!? That's amazing!   
Happy - Okay, next time I want you to try running with your toes raised.   
Happy - You'll go even faster that way.   
   
Meek-Looking Girl   
Got it, Coach!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - Phew...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
I did a lot of research on this, so I'm glad to see it's actually working.   
I mean, now that I've agreed to coach them, I gotta do a good job, right?   
I even used the school library for the first time, to put together a training routine.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - I gotta say though, I'm amazed how much their times have improved just from correcting their form.   
Happy - Elementary school kids really learn fast, don't you think?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You're right, it's impressive.   
That's not normal?   
It's because you teach so well.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - I know, they have so much room to grow!   
Happy - And it's motivating for us too, when we can see the results.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
What, seriously?   
I guess it might be for someone as athletic as you...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Oh, I don't know about that.   
Happy - ...But hearing you say so does make me feel like I can do anything.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - These kids really give it their all...   
Oh?   
   
Spunky Boy   
Hrrraaaaaah! Thousand Demon Sprint!   
   
Spunky Boy   
*pant* *pant* Okay, one more round!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Surprised - Hey, hold on a second!   
Surprised - You're all supposed to be on break right now!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Angry - It's important to take time to get good rest.   
Angry - Kids your age need to be careful not to overdo it. You could get really hurt.   
   
Spunky Boy   
Yeah, but, there's no time for that!   
We can keep going! C'mon, we gotta show our fighting spirit!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - Hmm, I suppose we do only have so many days to train here...   
Sad - I don't know... What do you think, Arisato-kun?   
Sad - Should I change the training routine? Maybe they should be running more.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You shouldn't change it.   
Maybe you should rethink it.   
I trust whatever you decide, Yuko.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
...Really?   
Yeah, you're right. Our number one priority is not getting hurt.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
...No. I don't think so.   
Our number one priority is not getting hurt. All right!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Arisato-kun...   
Happy - You know what, you're right. I am the one who did all the research on how to avoid straining yourself. All right, listen up!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Angry - I'm your coach now, so you stop running when I tell you to stop!   
Angry - That's a promise you've gotta keep!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - But in return, I'll make sure you get faster than you've ever been!   
Happy - How does that sound? Think you can keep that promise?   
   
Spunky Boy   
Auntie Coach, you're on fire...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Angry - What did you just call me...? All right, those who agree to the terms, go back to your break!   
   
Kids   
Okay!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Sometimes I can't tell if they're actually listening to me or not.   
Happy - But this kinda feels good, doesn't it? Like some coming-of-age story.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - ...So, um, thanks for giving your input earlier. Honestly, if I was on my own, I would've let them keep running.   
Happy - I'm glad I asked you to coach with me. It means a lot having you here, Arisato-kun.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko is starting to trust me more.   
I feel like our relationship has grown...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Oh, by the way...   
Happy - The kids seem like they want to run with you.   
Happy - Do you think you could do just one lap? It'd be setting a good example for them.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I practiced with the children   
until the sun went down.   
I should head back to the dorm...

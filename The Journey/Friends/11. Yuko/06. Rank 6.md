Yuko Nishiwaki
We only have so much time to train here, so you have to practice on your own if you want to win!

Spunky Boy
Yeah, we can do that!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Good! And don't forget: Know your limits, and make sure you stretch properly!
Happy - ...Oh, Arisato-kun, why don't you give them some advice too?

Minato Arisato - Selection
You guys got this.
Show some guts!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Yeah! But don't forget to stay focused till the end!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Yeah! Guts! Spirit! You can do it, I know you can!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Now, listen. No matter what...
Angry - Think positive, and don't give in to fear!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The kids went home after
finishing their training.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Those kids are going to challenge the sixth graders soon.
Apparently, the winners will get to use the schoolyard.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - Earlier, they asked me to write the challenge letter for them... I'm a little worried, actually.
Sad - Not just about the race, but also about whether or not I spelled something wrong.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - So, what's your honest opinion?
Sad - Age difference really matters when you're as young as they are. Do you really think they can beat the sixth graders?

Minato Arisato - Selection
It's gonna be tough.
As long as we believe in them.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - Yeah, no way around that, I guess...

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - Some of the boys that age are even bigger than me. There's just so much difference in their physical strength.
...But even so!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Yeah, you're right! A coach has to believe in her team!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - And they've all trained so hard too!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - They'll be fine, right!? After all, they learned from us!
Sad - Then why am I feeling so nervous...?
It's gonna be okay. I'm sure they can win!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I feel a bond forming with Yuko.
It seems we've grown closer...

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - Come to think of it, I should've asked you to write the challenge letter, Arisato-kun...
Sad - I probably should've used bigger words... Ugh, I'll be so embarrassed if those sixth graders laugh at it.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yuko and I walked home together.

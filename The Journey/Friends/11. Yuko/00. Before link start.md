It's Yuko, the team manager.
Should I say hello?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I think I will.
Maybe not.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I left without Yuko noticing...

Yuko Nishiwaki
Oh, Arisato-kun. What's up...?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Wanna walk home together?
Nothing, see you tomorrow.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Actually, no. I'm in a hurry today.
Happy - See ya!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yuko went home alone...
I decided to go back to the dorm by myself.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Yeah, see ya!

Hmm... Okay, sure!
Happy - Why don't we stop somewhere along the way?

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Yeah, see you tomorrow!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Hey, Arisato-kun!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - If you're free today, do you wanna walk home together?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure.
No.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Great! Let's stop by the café on the way home.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Come on, don't be like that. Let's just take a little detour, okay?
Happy - I wanna talk about our club activities, too. Don't worry, I won't keep you too long.

It seems like there's something
Yuko wants to talk about...
Looks like I better go along with this.

Happy - Great! Let's stop by the café on the way home.

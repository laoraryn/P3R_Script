Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Okay, shopping for club stuff is done!
Happy - Good thing you came with me, Arisato-kun. I didn't realize there was so much to buy...
Sad - Also, I wasn't really in the mental state to do this alone today.

Minato Arisato - Selection
What happened?
You did good.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Oh, nothing major. Maybe I was exaggerating a bit.
Sad - Hmm... It's still bothering me, though.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Surprised - Huh? Oh... Um, thanks.
Sad - ...You're not going to ask me what happened? That's what you're supposed to do, you know. Based on the conversation.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - On today's classic literature pop quiz, I didn't know any of the answers...
Sad - And before I knew it, I'd dozed off. I ended up handing in a blank paper.

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's bad.
It wasn't your fault.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Angry - Tell me about it. And then Mr. Ekoda got all pissed off!
Angry - He called me to the faculty office, and even yelled at me about the length of my skirt!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - I know, right? I didn't do it on purpose. But then Mr. Ekoda got all pissed off...
Sad - He called me to the faculty office and told me I had to write a reflection essay.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - I had to listen to Mr. Ekoda lecture me for the longest time.
He was all like, "At this rate, you'll end up as a good-for-nothing adult," and "You're not putting enough thought into your future."
Angry - But come on, it's way too early to worry about the future, isn't it? We're still just teenagers!

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's true.
I don't think so.
You haven't thought about it?

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Right!? We should be allowed to enjoy ourselves now, while we still can.
Sad - Honestly, I haven't really thought about my future at all.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Surprised - Seriously? I didn't know you cared so much about school, Arisato-kun.
Sad - I... still haven't really thought much about my future.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - Hmm, not particularly... Well, I guess I would like to graduate.
Sad - Anything after that is pretty much undecided.

Yuko Nishiwaki
I'm working hard for the track team, so I think that's good enough for now.
Happy - As for the future, well... I've got plenty of time to think about it later.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yuko is smiling happily.
I feel like our relationship has grown...

Yuko Nishiwaki
...Hm, I guess this isn't the best place for a long conversation, huh?
I'm gonna go drop these off at the storage room. See ya.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Surprised - Ouch!

Spunky Boy
Owww...

Yuko Nishiwaki
Angry - Hey! It's dangerous to be running around here—

Wait, aren't you...?

Spunky Boy
Oh, Auntie Yuko!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - How many times do I have to tell you!? You can call me big sis, nothing else!

Spunky Boy
...Oh no, they're gonna catch me!
See ya, auntie!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Surprised - Hey, wait—!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - And he's gone...
That kid lives across the street from me. Why on earth are they playing tag in a place like this?
I mean, it's dangerous, right? They should go play in the schoolyard or something.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Surprised - Oh no, the school gate is gonna close soon! I'll see you at practice, Arisato-kun!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After saying goodbye to Yuko,
I decided to go back to the dorm.

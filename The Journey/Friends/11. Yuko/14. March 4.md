Oh, hey, Arisato-kun. Are you going home now?
Happy - Okay, then I am, too!
...At least, I want to. But I've actually got somewhere to be today.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Where?
I'll come with you.

Yuko Nishiwaki - MSG_002_0_0
Sad - I'll tell you, but don't laugh, okay?
Sad - I'm going to the public library...
'Cause, like, there weren't any books about sports physiology and stuff at the school library...
I'm gonna head out first to get some studying done, okay?
Then again... since we've already bumped into each other, I kinda wanna chat for a bit.
Happy - Wanna walk me to the entrance...?

Yuko Nishiwaki - MSG_003_0_0
Surprised - Huh!? N-No! You can't!
Oh, but...
Sad - Nahhh, never mind, we shouldn't!
I'm actually planning on going to the public library...
'Cause, like, there weren't any books about sports physiology and stuff at the school library...
I'm gonna head out first to get some studying done, okay?
Sorry about that.

Sad - I'm going to the public library...
'Cause, like, there weren't any books about sports physiology at the school library...
I wanna try studying stuff like that now.
Hmmm... But since we've already bumped into each other, wanna chat for a little longer?
At least until we reach the entrance?

Yuko Nishiwaki - MSG_007_0_0
Happy - Wait, really?
Er, nahhh, maybe you shouldn't.
I'm actually planning on going to the public library...
'Cause, like, there weren't any books about sports physiology and stuff at the school library...
I'm gonna head out first to get some studying done, okay?
I mean, if I had a friend there, we'd totally end up chatting the whole time instead of studying!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Well then, uh... guess I'll see ya. Gotta go home and study.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Good luck.
I want you to stay.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Hehe, yeah. Thanks!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - Aw... You know I can't.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Hey, remember what I told you before? About finally finding my dream?
I never had anything to work towards until now, so I'll admit I'd been slacking off.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - To be honest, my grades really suck! It's been tough getting them back up.
Sad - And that's why... I need to work harder.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Ugh, I really, REALLY want to hang out with you, Arisato-kun!
Sad - I want... to be with you.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - And I... want to feel closer to you too.

Yuko Nishiwaki
But I gotta be patient! That's what I have to keep telling myself.
I wanna take my dream into my own hands, and stand next to you with my head held high.
I want us to walk towards the future together...

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - You just watch, I'm gonna be so much more irresistible by then.
Happy - I bet you'll fall in love with me all over again!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Just kidding...
Sad - But that's why I need to be patient for now.

Yuko Nishiwaki
...Oh, I know!
Don't they say that food tastes the best after you've tried your hardest in a match?

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Well, this is just like that. If we're patient now and cool off for a while, then maybe later on...

Yuko Nishiwaki
Angry - Wait, what are you even making me say!?
Happy - ......

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - A-Anyway, that's all I have to say. See ya. We'll hang out sometime soon!

-

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Well, I'm gonna head off.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Going to study?
Going home already?

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Yep! I've been doing it every day. Aren't I awesome?

Yuko Nishiwaki
Pretty much. I gotta get back and study.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Hey, remember what I told you before? About finally finding my dream?
Sad - I never had anything to work towards until now, so I'll admit I'd been slacking off.
To be honest, my grades really suck! It's been tough getting them back up.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - Like, I have no idea what chemistry and all that stuff is about. Seriously, it's like a foreign language.
So that's why I really gotta buck up.

Yuko Nishiwaki
To tell you the truth, I really just wanna sit back and enjoy life!
But I gotta be patient! That's what I have to keep telling myself.

Yuko Nishiwaki
I'm gonna take my dreams into my own hands!
And then I'm gonna do some more studying, and then get a job.
Happy - But after that, we should totally hang out again! We can invite everyone from the track team too.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - ...Ooh, how about we have a drinking party, since we'll all be adults by then!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Umm... Well, anyway!
I'll be focusing only on my studies for now. So don't try to tempt me with anything!
Happy - Today I'm gonna work on three subjects at once. Impressive, right?

Yuko Nishiwaki
Oops, I better get going. I still need to buy dinner.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Well, see ya!

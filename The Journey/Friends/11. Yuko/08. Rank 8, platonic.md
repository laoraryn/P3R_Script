Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - I'm having trouble deciding which restaurant to go to.
This place looks cute, but this one looks a bit more reasonable...
Which one sounds better to you, Arisato-kun?

Minato Arisato - Selection
The cute one.
The reasonable one.
Either is fine.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - I hear you. It'd be great to go somewhere with a nice ambiance, right?
Sad - ...But we should try and get our money's worth too...

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Yeah, totally! We can't call it a party without getting lots of food!
But it'd also be nice to go somewhere with a cute ambiance...

Yuko Nishiwaki
Angry - ...That's the least helpful answer, you know. Guess it's up to me then.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Hmm... Should we just go to both?

Girl in Black Tights
Oh, Nishiwaki-san.

Girl with Bright Hair
With your boyfriend again, huh? You just love to show off, don't you?

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - I already said it's not like that.
He's just a friend from the team. That's all.

Girl in Black Tights
You know you don't have to try so hard to hide it.

Girl with Bright Hair
I bet there's a reason she has to keep quiet about it. Like, maybe she stole him from someone again?

Yuko Nishiwaki
Angry - Geez, give it a rest already!
Angry - Is that all you can think of when you see a guy and a girl together? You need to grow up.

Girl with Bright Hair
Wha...?

Yuko Nishiwaki
Look, I know you hate me.
Once you have a bad experience with something, it's hard to get over.
Angry - But harassing and bothering people over it... It's just wrong.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Angry - And I'm sorry, but I don't have time to put up with you right now.
Angry - I've found something important to me that I want to achieve.

Yuko Nishiwaki
So, how about you?
Is what you're doing here now important to you?

Girl in Black Tights
......

Girl with Bright Hair
Excuse me? You're the one who started—


Girl in Black Tights
It's fine. Let's just go.

Girl with Bright Hair
Hey, wait up!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - Sorry for always dragging you into situations like this.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Glad it didn't turn into a fight.
You handled it well.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - That's because I had a reliable friend like you next to me. You gave me the courage I needed.
Happy - ...And if something did happen, I trust that you'd step in.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - You know, if things were different, I might've turned out like her too.
Sad - Stuck in my own little bubble, never being able to take that first step forward...

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Well, I don't wanna overcomplicate this or anything.
Happy - I'm just really glad to have such a great friend!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can sense that Yuko trusts me.
I feel like our relationship has grown...

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Aw man! I'm starving!
Sad - Thinking and talking at the same time is tiring...
Happy - Let's go get dinner. Oh, I mean, to our celebratory party!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I went to celebrate with Yuko. I ate so
much, my stomach is about to burst.
I should head back to the dorm...

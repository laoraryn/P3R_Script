Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - There was this one time I left some tissues in the pocket of my running pants.
Happy - And then I washed it without realizing. Oh, boy, did that make a mess!
Oh, can you hang on a sec while I put my shoes on?

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - Not again...
Angry - It's the same stupid prank every time. Talk about unoriginal.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
There's a piece of gum on Yuko's locker...

Yuko Nishiwaki
...Phew, at least my shoes are safe.
Sad - Going that far would've been crossing the line.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Does this happen often?
Do you know who did it?

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - After the first few times, I stopped counting.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - I have my suspicions, but I don't plan to confront her.

Yuko Nishiwaki
I was pissed off at first, but eventually I just got used to it.
Getting worked up about this would just tire me out. It's not worth it.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Angry - ...But if I catch her in the act, I'm fully prepared to grab her and teach her a lesson.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Surprised - Uh, that was a joke, okay? I'm a nice girl! Really!
C'mon, let's go!

===============================================================================================

Yuko Nishiwaki
So I figured this might be a good time to update our team uniform.
What do you think of switching to running tights? They say it reduces wind resistance.

Girl with Bright Hair
Heeey, look over there. It's Nishiwaki-san.

Girl in Black Tights
Is that your new boyfriend?
On to the next one already, I see. Impressive, Nishiwaki-san.

Yuko Nishiwaki
We're not dating. He's just a friend from the team.

Girl in Black Tights
Come on, no need to act all polite in front of him. Just tell it how it is.
I'm surprised you could even get such a handsome guy. Maybe I should become a team manager, too.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - You've got it all wrong, as usual.

Girl with Bright Hair
Don't do it. You'll just be running around after everyone all day.
And it's not very attractive for a girl to be so muscular, you know?

Girl in Black Tights
Hey, not so loud, her boyfriend's like, right here. I kinda feel bad for her.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Angry - If that's really what you want to do, I won't stop you. But you're better off looking for a boyfriend elsewhere.
Angry - A manager is a busy job. You won't have time to go around sticking gum on people's shoe lockers.

Girl with Bright Hair
Wh-What on earth are you talking about? I-I haven't got a clue what that means.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Of course not. It was just a random example.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Angry - What's wrong? Did I say something to offend you?

Girl in Black Tights
...Not at all.

Girl with Bright Hair
H-Hey, let's just go already.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - Sorry you got dragged into that.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Friends of yours?
Don't worry about it.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - I guess I kind of know them, but not very well.

Yuko Nishiwaki
I should probably fill you in.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - No, you shouldn't have to deal with that. I'm sorry.

Yuko Nishiwaki
I should probably fill you in, before you get the wrong idea about me.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Let's go sit down.

Yuko Nishiwaki
That girl in the black tights... We went to the same middle school.
Back then, there was this boy on the basketball team who asked me out, and we started dating.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Angry - But it turns out, he was seeing her at the same time!
Angry - When she found out, she said I "stole" her boyfriend, even though I was a victim, too.
Angry - She blamed me because I was the manager of the basketball team. Isn't that just ridiculous?

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - And after I became the track team manager here in high school, that set her off on me again.
Sad - But really, all I want to do is support others so they can be the best they can be.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - Remember the gum on my locker? That was probably her doing. She's definitely the type to hold a grudge.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Angry - Oh, those girls have way too much time on their hands. All they do is complain and gossip.
Angry - Why don't they do something more productive!? They're the ones who should get a lecture from Ekoda!
Angry - "You're not putting enough thought into your future!" Tell that to them, not me.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Surprised - ...Oh! That reminds me, sorry for what they said about you...
Sad - They called you my boyfriend. That must have made you feel awkward, huh?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'm honored.
I don't mind.
It might be a problem.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Surprised - H-Hey, you!
Surprised - How can you say that with a straight face? And how many other girls have you used that line on, huh?
Surprised - When it comes to relationships, you should never play with a woman's emotions.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Yeah, thanks...
Surprised - B-But you should mind a little, right!? I'm a high school girl after all, you know!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - Y-You don't have to be so blunt about it...

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - Huh, why do I feel this way...? I mean, you're just a guy on the same team as me, right?

Yuko Nishiwaki
Oh, right.
Make sure you don't tell Kaz or anyone else about the two-timing thing, okay?
You're the only one I've told, Arisato-kun.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Surprised - Oh, also!
Surprised - I broke up with that two-timing jerk a long time ago, just so you know!
Happy - Uh, you might be thinking, "So what," right? Yeah, what am I saying, haha...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yuko seems flustered for some reason.
I feel like our relationship has grown...

Yuko Nishiwaki
Well, that dragged on. It's late, we should be getting home.
Happy - I'll see you soon!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After saying goodbye to Yuko,
I decided to go back to the dorm.

Arisato-kun, are you ready to go?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Now to figure out where... How does Paulownia Mall sound to you?   
Happy - I heard they have some pretty nice decorations and lights there.

I decided to spend   
Christmas Eve with Yuko...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Wooow! This place looks so different from how it usually does!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's beautiful.   
So, what's next?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Yeah! Good job, Paulownia Mall! This is so exciting, let's go!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Well, it's not every day we get a chance to see something like this, so I wanna take it all in.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Wow...   
Happy - It's kinda cold. Maybe we should stick close together...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Surprised - Oh, look! That looks pretty too!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko and I walked around and looked   
at the Christmas decorations.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - That was so nice. There were couples around everywhere, huh?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh yeah, before I forget...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - This is a little embarrassing, but...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I received the item (ITEM NAME).   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
It's supposed to work really well.   
My grandma taught me how to make it a long time ago. The weather's a lot colder now, so be sure to take care of yourself.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Christmastime is pretty magical, don't you think?   
Honestly, I didn't think much of it up until last year. It was just another yearly event to me.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
We'd have Christmas cake and chicken as a family, and then we'd exchange presents.   
Happy - When I'd wake up and find the presents next to my pillow, I'd always shout, "Santa really came!"   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
It was fun back then, sure, but this year, it's fun in a different way.   
......   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - ...Is it just me, or did it get hot all of a sudden? I wouldn't wanna sweat and catch a cold...   
......   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - Could I move closer to you... so I don't get too cold?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I shared a tender moment with Yuko...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Aww, time passed by so quickly... I don't wanna go home yet.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - I wish we could just stay here...   
Sad - ......   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Just kidding.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Besides, we have school tomorrow. Just because we're in our school uniforms, doesn't mean we can stay here all night, right?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
So I guess we gotta go home.   
Sad - ......   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
...Or do we?

I spent time with Yuko until night fell.

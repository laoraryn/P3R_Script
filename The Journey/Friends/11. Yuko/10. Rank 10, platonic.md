Yuko Nishiwaki
Surprised - Sorry I'm late!
I was asking the teacher about something I didn't understand in class.
But then it led to even more questions, so I was stuck there for a while.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - Ugh, this is so heavy. I shouldn't have crammed everything in there...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Stuff for the track team?
Want me to carry it?

Yuko Nishiwaki
Nope, they're reference books.
There were so many things I wanted to ask, I ended up bringing the books for every subject.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Nah, it's okay! I'll just think of it as weight training.
Still, I can't believe how heavy these textbooks are! Students all over the world have it rough.

Yuko Nishiwaki
......
Whenever I come to this field, I get so nostalgic.
It hasn't even been that long since we coached those kids though, huh?

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's just how fulfilling it was.
It's age...

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - You said it. I had to really put my brains and body to work.
Happy - I've never had to run around like that, not even for the track team.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Hey! You don't have to word it like that!
Happy - You could just say I've grown up or matured. Come on, now!

Yuko Nishiwaki
...Oh, that's right. Here, take this.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I obtained the item (ITEM NAME)!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - It's from those kids. They told me to "make sure I give it to Arisato-san."

Minato Arisato - Selection
They remembered my name...
Where's yours?
Thanks.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Yeah, they usually just called you "Coach" or "Boyfriend," huh?

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - I got one too. They told me they would "never forget their Auntie."

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - I'll be sure to let the kids know you liked it. They'll be super happy to hear.

Yuko Nishiwaki
...When you get something like this, it makes you forget how tough it was in the moment.
Kinda makes me wanna do it all again. What about you?

Minato Arisato - Selection
If the opportunity arises.
Only if you're doing it too.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Yeah, you're right.
Oh, but I would like more people to help out next time. It was pretty hard with just the two of us.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Huh? Me? Well, yeah, I guess I do want to.
Next time, we should get more people to help coach though. It was pretty tough with just the two of us.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Once I'm caught up on school, I'd like to take some time to think. Not just about coaching, but about enjoying life and stuff too.
Happy - Hehe, I can hardly wait. All right, time to study like hell!
...Oh, let me know when you figure out what you wanna do for your future too, okay?
If you decide on something similar, maybe we could even study together!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yuko and I talked for a long time.
I feel a strong bond with Yuko...

SYS_021_5_0
The Strength Social Link reached its maximum level! You can now fuse **Atavaka**, the wisdom king general!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Oh, look at the time. I need to go buy some reference books.
See you around, Arisato-kun.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After saying goodbye to Yuko,
I decided to go back to the dorm.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - It's from those kids. They told me to "make sure I give it to my boyfriend."

Minato Arisato - Selection
Boyfriend...
Where's yours?
I'm honored.

Yuko Nishiwaki
I've told them over and over that it's not true, but they just don't listen.
You and me as a couple... Really, kids have such wild imaginations.

Yuko Nishiwaki
I got one too. They told me they would "never forget their Auntie."

Yuko Nishiwaki
Whoa. I didn't think you'd react like that...
I mean, isn't that pretty unusual for you?
Happy - Anyways, I'll be sure to let the kids know you liked it. They'll be super happy to hear.

Yuko Nishiwaki
...When you get something like this, it makes you forget how tough it was in the moment.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Happy - Hehe, glad to hear it.
Oh, and while we're at it, we should invite more people to coach with us next time!

Yuko Nishiwaki
Sad - ...I don't think I could handle it on my own though.
It was hard enough with just the two of us... Maybe I should invite more people to coach with us next time.

Yuko Nishiwaki
Once I'm caught up on school, I'd like to take some time to think. Not just about coaching, but about enjoying life and stuff too.
Happy - I hope you can wait for me until then! I'll make sure I study hard.
...Oh, right!
If I do manage to become an athletic trainer...
My first job will be putting together a training routine for you, Arisato-kun!
You probably won't become a pro athlete, so I'll try not to make it too intense.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yuko and I talked for a long time.
I feel a strong bond with Yuko...

Yuko Nishiwaki
Whoa, look at the time! I gotta go buy some reference books!
See you around, Arisato-kun.

Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Wasn't the party we had so much fun?   
Sad - After I got home, I still ended up eating dinner after that.   
Happy - I thought my stomach was gonna explode!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That sounds like you.   
You're gonna get fat.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - ...Is that supposed to be a compliment?   
Happy - I think I ate enough to last three days... But it tasted great, so whatever.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - I couldn't help it! My mom's cooking is just too good to pass up.   
Happy - Arisato-kun, do you wanna come over next time and try it? Kaz does all the time.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
...Oh, wait, that's not what I wanted to talk about today.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Do you remember when I told you about what happened to me at school?   
It was when I handed in a blank answer sheet for that pop quiz, and I got yelled at by Ekoda...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - Back then, I wasn't really giving any thought to my future.   
But after coaching those kids, I started to realize something.   
I think I finally figured out what I want to do.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Can you guess what it is?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
A track and field star?   
An instructor?   
A nursery teacher?   
No idea...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - No, not that. I'd rather just teach. Being a professional athlete is too hard.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Hmm... Close! You almost got it, Mr. Ex-Assistant Coach.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
I did consider that one too, but I decided I should focus on one thing specifically.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - Come on, Arisato-kun, are you that dense? Or did I not give you enough clues?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
I'm thinking of becoming an athletic trainer.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
It's their job to monitor each athlete's diet, and help them plan their training routine.   
So I'll go to professional school once I graduate, and then work towards earning my certification when I turn twenty.   
Between the general education requirements and the classes for my major, it's gonna be over 350 hours.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
That's why I'm gonna start studying right now.   
I have to make up for all that time I wasted.   
Those kids really had a huge influence on me. I know I only agreed to coach them on a whim, but teaching them got me thinking.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - I started wondering what I could teach my own kids one day... And I realized I didn't have the slightest clue.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
If you hadn't been there with me, I don't think I could've stuck it out until the end.   
And I definitely never would've given any thought to my future, either.   
Happy - So... thanks.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko seems appreciative.   
I feel like our relationship has grown...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - I... also want to apologize. I know I'm always asking you to stick around and help me with stuff.   
Sad - But it's just because you're so reliable.   
Sad - Thinking back, I really caused you a lot of trouble, so... I'm sorry.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I don't mind.   
You can rely on me even more.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Huh? You mean it?   
Happy - Oh, what a relief! I'm so glad to have a great friend like you.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - ...Really? I'm gonna remember you said that, okay!?   
Happy - Man... Arisato-kun, you're the best! You can bet I'll be counting on you in the future.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
But also, I've got your back too. You know that, right?   
Unlike Kaz, you never show your emotions up front, Arisato-kun.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - You seem more like the type to keep things bottled up, so I'm a little worried about you.   
Happy - If you've got something on your mind, I'm here for you anytime, even if you just gotta rant, all right?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Thanks.   
You're so dependable.   
I do have some homework...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - I mean, I can't guarantee that I'll be much help, but...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - I'm nothing compared to you, though.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - Sorry, can't help you there. I could honestly use a bit of help myself.   
Angry - And anyways, you gotta do your own homework!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
But if nothing else, I at least have lots of stamina!   
Happy - As long as it's not schoolwork, I think I can be of some help! Don't be shy to ask, okay?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel affection coming from Yuko...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - Lately, I've been trying to drink coffee when I study.   
Sad - But I still get so sleepy... I wonder if it's because I add too much sugar.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I had fun chatting with Yuko for a while.   
I should head back to the dorm...

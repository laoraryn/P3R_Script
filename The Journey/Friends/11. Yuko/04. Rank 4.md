Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh yeah, have you been training to strengthen your core, Arisato-kun?   
It's a good idea if you want to shorten your run time. You're less likely to injure yourself too.   
I was talking with Kaz about putting it in the first-years' practice routine, actually.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Do you mind if we continue talking in the café? I'm a little hungry.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Surprised - Owww!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Angry - You again...!   
   
Spunky Boy   
Ah, man...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Angry - You know it's dangerous to be running around a place like this.   
Angry - You're lucky it's just me, but what if you bumped into a scary man, huh?   
Angry - If you want to play, do it at your schoolyard.   
   
Spunky Boy   
But we can't play there. The sixth graders are always hogging everything by playing soccer...   
   
Spunky Boy   
They said they'll move if we can beat them in a race, but...   
We're only fourth graders! There's no way we could win.   
   
Spunky Boy   
That's why we had to play tag here instead, Auntie Yuko.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - I'll let the "Auntie" slide this time, but only because I feel sorry for you.   
All right, come with me.

Meek-Looking Girl   
This field is soooo big!   
   
Spunky Boy   
Wow, high school is amazing!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - They said it's fine for us to use the schoolyard for a bit.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
...Normally, you wouldn't be allowed in here, understand?   
So don't touch anything you're not supposed to, and if something happens, let us know immediately.   
Can you promise that?   
   
Spunky Boy   
We promise!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Good. Then practice until the big hand on that clock reaches twelve. And don't go inside the school building!   
   
Spunky Boy   
All right! Let's do this!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Wait, come here for a second.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
You need to pump your arms more.   
And don't lift your legs so high, or you might pull a muscle.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Go on, give it a try! You just gotta believe in yourself!   
   
Spunky Boy   
Woohoooo! Check this out!   
   
Meek-Looking Girl   
Wow! Ken-chan, you're so fast!   
   
Meek-Looking Girl   
...Hey, big sis! You should be our coach!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - Aw, I'm a real sucker when kids look at me that way...   
Sad - But I've never tried coaching before...   
Sad - Arisato-kun, what do you think I should do?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Why not give it a go?   
That's for you to decide.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
You really think I should?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - Yeah, I know...   
   
Spunky Boy   
Come on, please!   
   
Kids   
Pleeeease!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - Hmm...   
Sad - Well, it isn't a decision to make lightly...   
Sad - ......   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - All right, I'll be your coach!   
Angry - But I'm not gonna go easy on you guys! And no one's allowed to quit halfway, either!   
Angry - Got it?   
   
Kids   
Got it, Coach Yuko!   
   
Mature-Looking Girl   
Hey, is he gonna teach us, too? Is he your boyfriend, Coach?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Never you mind about that.   
Now, everyone, line up! I said I wouldn't go easy on you, didn't I?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko began passionately   
instructing each child.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Angry - Think positive! If you think you're gonna lose, you will! Don't be afraid of them just because they're sixth graders!   
   
Kids   
That sounds hard... But okay!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I watched Yuko as she coached the kids.   
Eventually, they all went home...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Once they started calling me Coach, I couldn't resist.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - Hey, um...   
Sad - I was wondering. Would you maybe want to do this coaching thing together? I know I'm asking a lot, but...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - I don't know much about racing. And plus, you're really athletic, too.   
Sad - So if you'd coach them with me, I'd... really appreciate it.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - I mean, why not, right? Please? Honestly, I don't think I can handle it on my own...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure thing.   
It's kind of a hassle.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Oh, thank goodness...   
Happy - I'm sure those kids will be happy too! Thanks!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - Please! I'm begging you!   
Sad - I mean, when they ask like that, don't you just want to help them? Come on, pretty please?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It seems like Yuko is counting on me.   
I feel like our relationship has grown...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - I know that I keep asking you for favors, but I'll make it up to you one day!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I left school with Yuko and   
returned to the dorm...

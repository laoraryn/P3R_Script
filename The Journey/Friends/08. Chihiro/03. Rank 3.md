Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - A treasurer who's not even good at math... Doesn't that sound pathetic?
Sad - I never even wanted this job... Someone else entered me into the running. I didn't think I would actually get elected though...

Chihiro Fushimi
Happy - ...Oh! But I don't regret joining the student council or anything.
Happy - If I hadn't joined, then I wouldn't have met such kind people, like you, or the president.

Garish Student
...Shut up. You're distracting us.

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - Oh...! I-I'm... I'm sorry...

Garish Student
If you're gonna flirt with each other, go do it outside.

Lazy Student
I'm so tired of this. I can't even pick up my pencil anymore.
...But if you give me a kiss, maybe I can study for another thirty minutes.

Garish Student
What're you going on about now...?
C'mon, you gotta take this seriously. Don't you want us to go to the same college?

Lazy Student
Just gimme a kiss! Please!

Garish Student
...All right, fine.

Chihiro Fushimi
Angry - They're really gonna kiss...?
Angry - ...Do they not know where they are!?

Minato Arisato - Selection
They have no shame.
They're gonna kiss...?
Where did they go?

Chihiro Fushimi
That's right, Arisato-san! I agree!

Chihiro Fushimi
Angry - This is supposed to be a place of learning. And they're still just kids!

Chihiro Fushimi
Angry - That's not what's important right now!

Chihiro Fushimi
Angry - This is supposed to be a place of learning. And they're still just kids...!

Chihiro Fushimi
Angry - I don't know! And I don't want to know!

Chihiro Fushimi
Angry - This is supposed to be a place of learning. And they're still just kids...!

Chihiro Fushimi
Angry - So I say this, as a member of the student council...

Chihiro Fushimi
Angry - That kind of inappropriate behavior should not be tolerated at school!

Chihiro Fushimi
Angry - We should notify the student council president right away, and discuss this at our next meeting!

Minato Arisato - Selection
I agree.
That's kind of extreme...
You don't like kissing?

Chihiro Fushimi
Happy - If you're on my side, Arisato-san, then I have nothing to fear!

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - ...I'm sorry. I shouldn't be raising my voice in the library...

Chihiro Fushimi
Surprised - What do you mean by that? You... You really don't think it's a big deal!?

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - Ah... I'm sorry. I shouldn't be raising my voice in the library...

Chihiro Fushimi
Angry - Th-That's not the point here! I'm just trying to say that there's a time and place for everything!

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - ...Oh no, I...
Sad - I shouldn't be raising my voice in the library...

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - I-I don't mind if I get in trouble, but...
Sad - I don't want you to get criticized too, Arisato-san...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can tell Chihiro is concerned about me.
I feel like our relationship has grown...

Chihiro Fushimi
Surprised - Oh, I didn't notice the time!

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - Um... I think I'm going to be stuck here for a while, so... you don't need to wait for me.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I parted ways with Chihiro, then
headed back to the dorm.

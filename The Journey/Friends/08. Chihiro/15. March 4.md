Oh, Arisato-san.   
Sad - A-Are you okay? You don't look so good...   
Sad - You should get home and rest before it gets worse...   
Right now, I, um...   
Sad - ...Oh, sorry! This isn't the time to talk about that...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What is it?   
Maybe next time.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi - MSG_002_0_0   
Arisato-san...   
U-Um, I suppose I can tell you. It's nothing important, though...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi - MSG_003_0_0   
O-Okay! I'm sorry...   
Sad - Um, have a good rest...

Sad - Look at this flyer over here.   
Sad - "The dark history of student-teacher romance"...?   
Sad - ......   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - People are free to fall in love with who they want... There's nothing wrong with that!   
Sad - I can see why it would be a problem if it was between a teacher and a student, but...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - That doesn't give them the right to make fun of it like this.   
Sad - ...I'm going to write a letter of protest to the school paper.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
...Oh, I'll be all right on my own.   
......   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
I'm... going to do this by myself.   
Happy - Thank you, Arisato-san.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
...There's one thing I've decided for myself.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
It's not much, but...   
I'd like to continue on the student council for next year too.   
......   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
It was because of you that I was able to change, Arisato-san. I know that for a fact.   
And I never would have met you if I hadn't joined the student council.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - That's why I want to stay involved... At least, I hope I can.   
Happy - ......   
   
-   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - I want to be able to like myself more.   
Happy - And I want you to like me more, too...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - I want to be... the first one you think of.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
That's why...   
Um...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
I... love you.   
......   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Surprised - ...What am I saying!?   
Surprised - I-I can't believe I said something like that at school... I-I'm sorry!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
W-Well then! Please excuse me!   
Happy - But maybe next time... we could go home together.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - I have so many places I'd like to see.   
Happy - And I want to visit each and every one of them... with you.   
   
-   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
I want to become strong and reliable, just like the student council president.   
That's why I want to join the student council next year, and the year after that too...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - It's a big goal, but I'm going to take it one step at a time.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
...Well then, I should be going.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - I'm looking forward to seeing you next year too!

Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - ...Is it just me, or is the air conditioning in here too high? I feel a little light-headed...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - I haven't been feeling well lately... I couldn't even finish my lunch today.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - I think I may have caught a cold...   
Sad - I'm sorry, but do you think we could go to the pharmacy?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - I'm going to go get some medicine. I'll be right back.   
   
Pretentious Man   
Oh, hey there! You on your way home from school?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Huh? Wh-What do you want...?   
   
Pretentious Man   
Wow, you're really cute! From this angle, I can see how gorgeous you are in those glasses!   
Say, you wanna maybe sit down at a café and chat a little?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - U-Um, I...   
   
Pretentious Man   
Hey, c'mon, don't be scared. I'm not gonna bite!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - N-No... Please stop...!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Arisato-san!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Get lost.   
...Hey.   
   
Pretentious Man   
Huh? Who the hell're you?   
   
Pretentious Man   
Wait... Don't tell me that you're with her!   
Hmph...   
   
Pretentious Man   
Psh, I thought I had a chance since she looked so plain...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Oh, thank goodness... I thought you were going to hit him for a second, Arisato-san...   
Sad - I wouldn't want you to get into a fight because of me... But just now, you were so... Um...   
   
Pretentious Man   
What do you want? What're you glaring like that for anyways...?   
   
Pretentious Man   
Wait... You're not with her, are you?   
   
Pretentious Man   
Ugh, she's freakin' taken...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - You're usually so quiet, Arisato-san, but I guess you can be tough when you need to be.   
I-I don't mean that in a bad way though... I... Um...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Hngh... You've already saved me so I'm not scared anymore, but...   
Sad - Why am I still shaking?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's hold hands.   
I'm here for you.   
Take a deep breath.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Surprised - Huh...? H-Hold hands...?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - I-I'm so sorry... I... don't think I'm ready for this just yet...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
...Oh, but at least I'm not shaking anymore. Thank you...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
That does make me feel a lot better... Okay.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Thank you. I think I'm fine now.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
...Oh, that really did help calm me down a bit.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Thank you. I think I'm fine now.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I can sense Chihiro trusts me.   
I feel like our relationship has grown...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Huh? Wh-Why do I... suddenly feel short of breath...?   
Sad - Arisato-san, I...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - I think I really did catch a cold... I feel like my face is all flush.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
...Um... Thank you again for saving me today!   
Now, please excuse me!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Chihiro hurried away...   
I decided to return to the dorm.

Sad - Um...   
Angry - Wh-What do you want!?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I just wanted to talk...   
Nothing, really.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Angry - I-I-I don't have anything to talk about!   
Sad - Oh, um...   
Sad - I'm sorry...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi

Sad - Oh, um...   
Sad - I'm sorry...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - S-Sorry about that...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Arisato-san... Um... About what happened the other day...   
Sad - I, um... sort of overreacted... And I, um... just wanted to say I'm sorry.   
Sad - I get really nervous when I talk to people... although I know I should really do something about it.   
Sad - It... It's especially bad when I talk to boys... All I can think about is running away in that situation...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Half the school are guys.   
Half the world are guys.   
I'm a guy.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - T-True... I should've gone to an all-girls school.   
But I guess it's too late for that. And now I'll be here for almost three years...   
...I have to try harder to overcome this phobia.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Oh god... That just makes me scared to even go outside.   
But... I can't stay afraid all my life.   
...I have to try harder to overcome this phobia.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Angry - I-I know! That's why I'm so nervous now...   
Sad - S-Sorry, I know I can't perform my duties on the student council if I'm like this...   
...I have to try harder to overcome this phobia.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Th-Thank you. I'll try to do my best...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Angry - H-Hello!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Hello.   
Oh, hey.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - I was able to say hello to you!   
Sad - Although... the more I think about it, the more nervous I get...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - I was able to say hello to you!   
Sad - Although... the more I think about it, the more nervous I get...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
I hope I can get better at this somehow...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's hang out.   
Good luck.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Surprised - Huh...?   
Surprised - U-U-U-Um, uh... This is so sudden, um...   
Angry - ...I-I need to think about it!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Th-Thank you, I'll try...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi

Chihiro Fushimi   
I'll do my best...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Angry - H-Hello!   
Sad - Um, the other day, when you, um, invited me out...   
I-I've been thinking...   
Um, if it's okay with you, would you, um, like to...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's walk home together.   
Sorry, I'm busy today.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Surprised - O-O-O-Okay!   
Happy - Um, then, I'll go get ready...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Oh, I-I see... Sorry...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
H-Hello!   
D-Do you have some time today?   
Sad - Would you like to, um...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's walk home together.   
Sorry, I'm busy today.

Happy - Um, then, I'll go get ready...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Oh, I-I see... Sorry...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Oh, Arisato-san... Are you on your way home?   
Um, would you like some company...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It seems like Chihiro wants   
to walk home with me...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend some time   
after school with her?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Spend time with her   
Check Social Link status   
Not now   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Oh! O-Okay!   
Oh, but before that... do you mind if we stop by the library first?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Surprised - Oh, th-thank you so much!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - U-Um, this is kind of embarrassing, but... will you help me with my homework?   
Happy - It's math, to be specific... Let's talk about it more at the library.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Thank you so much...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - It's lonely by myself...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - O-Oh! Happy to hear it...   
......   
Surprised - Um! I-In that case...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - W-Would you like to come over to my house? It's a little far, but...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Th-Thank you, Arisato-san...   
Th-Then, um... I...   
I want to be with you...   
Happy - W-Would you like to come over to my house? I don't think my mom will be in until late...   
Happy - Let's go...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Thank you!   
There's no meeting today, so let's go ahead and use the student council room.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - O-Oh, I'm sorry. I... didn't mean to impose...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Oh...   
Sad - ......   
Sad - D-Did you need something?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - ......   
Sad - U-Um, Arisato-san. I...   
Sad - ...Never mind, it was nothing. What do you want?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I want to apologize.   
Please forgive me.   
Nothing.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
......   
I didn't think you'd keep coming back...   
To be honest... it made me happy, seeing you care so much. I'm sorry I didn't say so sooner.   
Happy - Um... Maybe some other time, we could go out together?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The two of us made up!   
I should be able to invite her   
out the next time I'm free...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - ......   
Sad - If that's how you feel, you should have behaved better to begin with.   
Sad - ......   
Sad - I don't care anymore...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Chihiro still won't open up to me...   
I might have to try talking to her over a few   
days before I can mend our relationship.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Oh, um... Goodbye.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - I'm busy today...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Oh, Arisato-san.   
Ever since I met you, each day has been better than the last.   
Happy - Because of your support, I have the confidence to do anything...   
Happy - I hope I can help you, the same way you've helped me.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel an unbreakable bond   
with Chihiro...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Oh, Arisato-san...   
Happy - Ever since I met you, each day has been better than the last.   
I... I know I've caused a lot of trouble for many people up to now.   
And I was very dependent on you solving my problems...   
Happy - But that's not going to happen again, not anymore.   
Happy - I want people to rely on me, like they do the student council president... So wish me luck?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel an unbreakable bond   
with Chihiro...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Um, the other day, when you, um, invited me out...   
I-I've been thinking...   
Um, if it's okay with you, would you, um, like to...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
D-Do you have some time today?   
Would you like to, um...?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Um, by the way... are you on your way home?   
Um, would you like some company...?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Arisato-san... Um, exams are finally over.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Oh, Arisato-san. Exams are finally over.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
U-Um, uh...

Um, would you like some company...?

Are you on your way home now? Um, would you like some company...?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Oh! O-Okay!   
Um, actually... I'd like to stop by somewhere, too.   
Could we go to the strip mall?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Surprised - Oh, Arisato-san... How have things been?   
Looking away - Actually...   
Sad - Um... I'd like to ask you a favor if you have time today.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Looking away - Actually...   
Sad - Um... I'd like to ask you a favor if you have time today.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Oh, Arisato-san... Did you make any plans today?   
Sad - Um... If you aren't busy, I was hoping that maybe we could walk home together...?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Oh, that reminds me... Did you make any plans today?   
Sad - Um... If you aren't busy, I was hoping that maybe we could walk home together...?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Oh, thank you so much!   
Happy - Th-Then... how about we have a chat at the café today?

If you don't mind... I'd like to join you.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Are you heading home now?   
If you don't mind... I'd like to join you.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Thank you!   
Happy - Then... could we stop by the strip mall? I was hoping to check out the bookstore...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Oh, Arisato-san... Are you leaving now?   
Um... I was thinking about visiting the bookstore again.   
Looking away - I know it might be a lost cause, but still...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
By the way, are you leaving now?   
Um... I was thinking about visiting the bookstore again.   
Looking away - I know it might be a lost cause, but still...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Oh, thank you so much!   
Sad - To be honest... I was afraid to go by myself, but with you there, then even if someone bought it...   
Angry - No, I should be more optimistic! Okay, let's go, Arisato-san!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Oh, hello, Arisato-san...   
Are you free later today? I was hoping we could study together...

Looking away - Well... I actually wanted to talk to you, too.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Oh, thank goodness... I was hoping you'd say yes.   
I wonder if there's still room in the library... I'll go ahead and find us some seats!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Arisato-san... You came...   
Looking away - I'm sorry. I didn't want you to see me like this, but here we are...   
Sad - I was hoping we could walk home together today... Is that okay?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Um, I was hoping we could walk home together today... Is that okay?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Thank you... You're always so kind to me.   
Sad - ...I want to get away from the school as quickly as possible. Shall we get going?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi

Looking away - ...Sorry. All of a sudden, I'm starting to feel nervous.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Surprised - Oh...   
Looking away - ...Sorry. All of a sudden, I'm starting to feel nervous.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Hello, Arisato-san. Are you going home now?   
Did you know that the student council has a street fundraiser every year?   
I'm actually going to start prepping for it by making some flyers.   
Happy - If you're free, do you think you could help me out?

Happy - If you're free, do you think you could help me out?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I don't think she's willing to talk to me   
anymore. I should try again another time...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - O-Oh, I'm sorry. I... I didn't mean to impose...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - O-Oh, I'm sorry. You must be busy...

Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Oh... Sorry, I shouldn't have assumed. Take care.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Oh, I-I'm sorry. It's okay if you already had plans...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - O-Oh, sorry for imposing. Maybe another day then...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Oh, I-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bother you...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - O-Oh, sorry. Don't worry about it. I didn't know you had plans.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Surprised - Oh... I'm sorry!   
Maybe some other time, then... Just don't forget, okay?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Oh, I see...   
Happy - That's okay. Whenever you're free is fine by me.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
So... let's try again some other time.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - If there is anything I can do for you, please don't hesitate to ask, okay?

Chihiro Fushimi
Not too many people come here at this hour. This time of day is perfect.
Sad - So, um... there was something I needed to ask you...

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'm all ears.
Something on your mind?

Chihiro Fushimi
Happy - Th-Thank you...!

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - Y-Yes. I don't really have anyone else I can turn to...

Chihiro Fushimi
So there's this... friend I have. Um, she's a girl...
And well, there's a boy who's been helping her a lot recently.

Chihiro Fushimi
Like giving advice on her problems, looking over her homework, that kind of thing.
She even told me that lately, she can't stop thinking about him...

Chihiro Fushimi
So I-I was wondering...
Is she in love right now!?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, she's in love.
You're jumping to conclusions.

Chihiro Fushimi
Arisato-san...

Chihiro Fushimi
......

Chihiro Fushimi
...Now that I'm hearing you say it, I get the feeling you're right.
Happy - Or at least, I hope you are... I mean, I'm sure that's how my, um, friend feels.

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - ...Y-Yes, you're right.

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - Now that I think about it... maybe it was actually just admiration and respect.

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - I do tend to get swept up in my own thoughts without stopping to question anything...
Sad - That's a bad habit of mine.

Chihiro Fushimi
But it is a relief though... I mean, I won't end up giving my friend the wrong advice now.

Chihiro Fushimi
Happy - Thank you.
Happy - With your help, I think I know how I should proceed now.

Chihiro Fushimi
Surprised - Ah... I-I mean, I know what to tell my friend now.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Chihiro looks as if a weight
was lifted off her shoulders.
I feel like our relationship has grown...

Chihiro Fushimi
Sorry for asking you about such a weird topic.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Happy to help.
Don't worry about it.

Chihiro Fushimi
Arisato-san...
Happy - You always take my problems so seriously... You're too nice.

Chihiro Fushimi
Happy - I'm so glad to hear you say that.

Chihiro Fushimi
Well, should we get going?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I walked with Chihiro until
it was time to part ways.

===============================================================================================

Chihiro Fushimi
...Oh, that reminds me.
I think I'm slowly starting to get over my fear of men.

Chihiro Fushimi
So far, I can only talk to boys I know, but... I can almost look them in the eye!
But with you, Arisato-san, I... I think I can do even better!

Chihiro Fushimi
As long as it's nothing too scary... G-Go ahead!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
If I make the wrong move
here, I might upset her.
What should I do...?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Hold her hand
Kiss her
Speak to her softly

Chihiro Fushimi
Surprised - Oh...
Happy - Your hand...

Chihiro Fushimi - MND_005_0_0

Chihiro Fushimi - MND_006_0_0

Chihiro Fushimi
Happy - It's so rugged... and strong... and warm...
......
It... It's almost like... we're a couple...

Chihiro Fushimi
Surprised - I-I'm so sorry! I can't believe I said something so inappropriate!

Chihiro Fushimi
Ah, um, uh... Sh-Should we get going!?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I held Chihiro's hand until it was time
to part, then went back to the dorm.

Chihiro Fushimi
Surprised - Hm...?


Chihiro Fushimi
Surprised - Wh-What do you think you're doing!?
Surprised - W-We aren't even officially dating... Why would you do this!?
Angry - D-Do you think it's funny? Just what kind of girl do you think I am!?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
There's an uncomfortable
tension between us...
Our relationship is becoming unstable...

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - I can't believe you would do something like that, Arisato-san... I was wrong about you!
Sad - And e-even if I did feel the same way about you... that still doesn't make it okay...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Having been left alone, I decided
to go back to the dorm.

Chihiro Fushimi
Surprised - Huh? Oh... Um...?
Sad - Is that it...?

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - I-I would've been okay holding hands...

Chihiro Fushimi
Surprised - Oh! N-Nothing!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I walked with Chihiro until it was
time to head in a different direction.

Chihiro Fushimi
Happy - Arisato-san, over here!
Can you believe I went to the faculty office and said all that? I even surprised myself a bit!
This whole thing is just... Hehe.
Happy - Ehehehehe!

Minato Arisato - Selection
What's gotten into you?
So you ARE guilty.

Chihiro Fushimi
Happy - Come on... Can you blame me? Hehe, ahaha...

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - No. I'm. Not!

Chihiro Fushimi
Happy - Remember when I said, "I can't allow that!" to the student council president? Hehe...

Chihiro Fushimi
It's just, when I thought about you and Miss President being alone in a room together...
I got really mad at even the thought of it.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Chihiro has a refreshed smile on her face.
I feel like our relationship has grown...

Chihiro Fushimi
Happy - I've been like that ever since I was little, or so my mom says.
Happy - Normally, I'm quiet and timid, but when it comes to something I care about, I get really aggressive.

Chihiro Fushimi
It's because I...

Chihiro Fushimi
U-Um... Arisato-san...
There's... something I want to say to you.

Chihiro Fushimi
Actually... I've wanted to say it for a while, but I didn't think I had it in me.
But, I think I can do it now.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I better choose my words carefully here...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I better choose my words carefully here...
Come to think of it, **I have a special**
**relationship with another person already**...

Chihiro Fushimi
Arisato-san, I... I lo...
Happy - I love you!

Minato Arisato - Selection
I feel the same, Chihiro.
I like working with you, but...

Chihiro Fushimi
Surprised - Huh? What did you say...?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I said I feel the same.
I love you.

Chihiro Fushimi
Happy - Oh, I'm so happy, Arisato-san!
Happy - It feels like something out of a manga.
Happy - Um, uh... I hope we continue to get along well together.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I have entered a special
relationship with Chihiro...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
There's no going back now...

Chihiro Fushimi
Oh! I still have to apologize to the student council president.
Happy - Um, is it okay if I ask you to wait by the school gate?
Happy - I'd like for us to be able to go home together...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After speaking with Mitsuru, we
headed back home together.
...I ended up getting home
a little later than usual.

Chihiro Fushimi
Looking away - O-Oh, I see...

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - Umm...!
Sad - Then, do you think... we could still be friends?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure thing.
Yeah, friends.

Chihiro Fushimi
Oh, thank goodness...
I'm just glad that we're still closer than when we first met.

Chihiro Fushimi
Happy - Oh! I still have to apologize to the student council president.

Chihiro Fushimi
Looking away - I think I owe her an explanation, so... Excuse me.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I parted ways with Chihiro, then
headed back to the dorm alone...

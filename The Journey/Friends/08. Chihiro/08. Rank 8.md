Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - That missing fee money from the other day still hasn't turned up yet.
Sad - No one's said anything to me, but I know what they're all thinking...

Chihiro Fushimi
Looking away - I can't take this anymore... I... I don't want to be here...

Chihiro Fushimi
I-I'm sorry! I... I shouldn't say that. I'm supposed to be a member of the student council...
I'm... going to look for some books...

Short-Haired Student
Yeah, there's no way it could've been anyone else. It's gotta be her.
It's that first-year on the student council, Fushimi. The gloomy girl, with the long hair and glasses. The one who's always reading.

Short-Haired Student
I hear she stole all the class's money.
2,500 yen per person... Damn, I could buy a brand name purse with that much!

Long-Haired Student
Well, I heard she has no father...
So there's no way they could have that much money, since her mom only works part-time.

Short-Haired Student
See, how could it not be her!? And with such an innocent face, too...

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's all a misunderstanding.
......

Long-Haired Student
...Huh? Who even are you...?

Long-Haired Student
Is he a friend of Fushimi-san's...? Probably not. He doesn't look like the type that would hang out with her.

Short-Haired Student
Whoa! Hey, look! That guy is kinda hot!

Short-Haired Student
He's totally checking us out, isn't he!?

Library Staff
Excuse me, this is the library. Please, show some respect.

Short-Haired Student
Let's go outside. We can finish talking there.

Chihiro Fushimi
Looking away - I...
Looking away - ...C-Couldn't find any books...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Chihiro looks like she's about to cry...
She must have heard everything.

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - ...Let's go.

===============================================================================================

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - ...You heard all that, right? There've been rumors going around my class.

Chihiro Fushimi
Looking away - The only time I feel safe now is when I'm with you, Arisato-san.
Looking away - I don't really have anyone else I can count on...

Minato Arisato - Selection
The rumors will stop soon.
I know you're innocent.
Be strong.

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - So you think I should just wait it out? I know you're probably right, but...

Chihiro Fushimi
Looking away - When will the rumors stop? Will everyone just assume I'm a thief until then?

Chihiro Fushimi
Oh, thank you!
You're the only one who's on my side, Arisato-san...

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - I don't know what I'd do on my own right now...

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - Y-You make it sound so simple...

Chihiro Fushimi
Looking away - I know you're right, but... how am I supposed to be strong in a situation like this?

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - I-I'm sure I sound like I'm helpless, but, um... I'm okay, just so you know.

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - I don't think it's right for me to always be counting on you.
Sad - I have to solve this on my own...

Internal MES - MND_008_0_0
I feel like I understand
Chihiro a little better now...

Internal MES - MND_009_0_0
The school day is almost over.

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - I have to go now, Arisato-san. Excuse me.

Internal MES - MND_011_0_0
I parted ways with Chihiro,
then went back to the dorm.

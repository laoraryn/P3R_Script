Sad - Is... Is this, um, really okay? Are you sure you don't mind or anything?   
Sad - I mean, um, I'm glad you're willing to... b-but...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What are you trying to say?   
Have you changed your mind?   
Just relax...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Oh! Um... Um...   
Sad - N-Nothing...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - N-No! I was just... Um... This is all just so sudden...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - O-Oh, right... I-I'm not very good at talking to boys...   
Sad - There are a lot of guys in the student council though, so I should work on that...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
...Oh! School is almost out. Let's go.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
We walked all the way to the dorm,   
neither of us saying a word.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
......   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Surprised - ...Oh! I-I'm sorry! I was just thinking about... what to say...   
Sad - I was trying to come up with a topic you might be interested in, Arisato-san, but... I couldn't think of anything...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
This is... Iwatodai Dorm, right? Do you live here, Arisato-san?   
Sad - My house is in the other direction...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Why didn't you say so?   
I should've asked.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - S-Sorry!   
Sad - I knew we were going the wrong direction, but... I-I couldn't bring myself to say anything...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - N-No, it's not your fault!   
Sad - I noticed we were going in the wrong direction. I should've spoken up...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Um, I know you took time out of your schedule just for me, so...   
Happy - Th-Thank you very much for today.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Chihiro seems to appreciate my company.   
I feel like we've gotten a little closer...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
W-Well, um... Please excuse me.

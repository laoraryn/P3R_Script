Happy - Oh, that yukata looks nice.   
Happy - I don't have one myself though... How do you feel about yukatas, Arisato-san?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I like them.   
I like what you have on.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - That makes sense. A yukata would be perfect for the summer festival.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Really? I think a yukata would be more appropriate for the summer festival.   
Surprised - Oh, but... you were, um, giving me a compliment, weren't you...? Sorry. And, thank you.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
I'd like to get a yukata, but whenever I have money, I end up spending it on books.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Which reminds me, I got a new manga recently.   
Happy - It's really easy to get into, and the story makes you feel all warm inside.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Surprised - Oh... Sorry! We were talking about yukatas, weren't we?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Mmm, something smells delicious... It must be takoyaki.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Um, do you think we should order some?   
I don't think I can finish them by myself, so maybe we can split them?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Excuse me. Can I get one order of takoyaki, please?   
   
Takoyaki Vendor   
Ya sure can!   
   
Takoyaki Vendor   
...Here you go, one order of takoyaki!   
Today, I'm using a special ingredient in place of the octopus!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Takoyaki without octopus... I'm a little scared to try it.   
Happy - But it smells so good... I guess we're about to find out what's inside.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Here you go. They're hot, so be careful.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
......   
Happy - It's so good! It's all juicy inside...   
But I can't figure out what she put in them...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Wow, look at all the masks!   
Happy - That cat one is cute! I just want to pet it...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Oh, a hyottoko mask! It looks so weird... Like an octopus!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Now I feel like I'm really in the summer festival spirit.

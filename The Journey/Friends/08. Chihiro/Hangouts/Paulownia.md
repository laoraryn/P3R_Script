Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - I'm sorry I asked you to come all the way here...

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - Th-This is the first time I've ever asked a boy to, um... h-hang out.

Chihiro Fushimi
To be honest... I was kind of worried.
I kept thinking, "What if he doesn't show up?"

Minato Arisato - Selection
I keep my promises.
Try not to worry so much.
I didn't really have a choice.

Chihiro Fushimi
Happy - Y-Yes, that's good! It's a terrible thing to break a promise, you know, so...
Oh, s-sorry! I didn't mean to sound so, um, condescending...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Chihiro seems embarrassed.
I learned a little more about her today.

Chihiro Fushimi
Happy - Y-You're right. Sorry, it's a bit of a bad habit of mine.
I worry too much about what people think of me... I-I just get, um... very self-conscious.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Chihiro seems a bit happier.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - Oh, so... you only came because you felt like you had to?
Sad - I-I'm sorry, I... Y-You could've just said no when I asked. I didn't mean to force you...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Chihiro seems depressed.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Chihiro Fushimi
So, um... what should we do?
Sad - I-I was so worried that you might not show up that I... forgot to think of what to do if you did...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We browsed various stores for a while,
and then I decided to return to the dorm.

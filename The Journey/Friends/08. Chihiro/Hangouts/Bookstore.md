Phew... I'm glad that illustration collection is still there...   
Sad - But...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Um, sorry for changing the topic, but I'm still worried about the missing money...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - I hope it was just some kind of mistake...   
Sad - It's sad to think that there might be a thief at our school...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Don't worry, it wasn't a thief.   
So how much was it?   
Maybe they regret it now.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
...O-Of course, you're right. It couldn't be.   
As a member of the student council, I shouldn't make accusations like that. I should follow your example, Arisato-san.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Chihiro seems impressed.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - How much money? Um, I don't think the amount really matters...   
Sad - However small or large the sum, theft is a crime. We shouldn't take it lightly...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Chihiro seems sad.   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - ...I don't want to assume that it actually was a thief, but... maybe you're right.   
Perhaps it was just the heat of the moment. I... don't want to think that they're just evil...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Chihiro is nodding.   
I learned a little more about her today.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Oh, I'm sorry... I didn't mean for you to have to listen to my worries on your day off.   
Um... How about I treat you to something as a thank-you?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
We spent some more time at the strip mall   
together before I returned to the dorm.

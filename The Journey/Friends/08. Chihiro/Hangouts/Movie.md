Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - I'm so sorry I'm making you leave the movie partway through...

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - I just... I couldn't focus on the movie because I kept worrying that...

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - I-I was afraid that I might see that guy from before who tried to, um...

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'd help you again.
It could happen anytime.
Don't let it bother you.

Chihiro Fushimi
Happy - R-Right. I'm sure I'll be fine if I'm with you.
Happy - Oh, but please try not to get into any fights. I don't want you to get hurt.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Chihiro is smiling.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - H-Hey! Please don't say things like that! It was really scary last time!
Sad - First you help me, and now you try to scare me... I don't understand you sometimes...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It looks like I made Chihiro upset.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Chihiro Fushimi
Happy - Y-Yeah, I'll try... I mean, it's not like it was here that we ran into him before anyway.
Happy - I'm sorry I was so distracted today. It was rude of me, wasn't it?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Chihiro seems to be feeling
a little better now.
I learned a little more about her today.

Chihiro Fushimi
Oh, right. My mom asked me to buy some things for her on my way back...
I should take care of that before it gets too dark. Thank you for today, Arisato-san.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I waved goodbye to Chihiro as she headed to
the strip mall, then I returned to the dorm.

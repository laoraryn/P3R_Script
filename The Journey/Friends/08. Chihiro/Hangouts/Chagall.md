Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - Um, about last time...

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - I-I just wanted to apologize for bringing up an uncomfortable topic like that...
But I think your advice really, um... helped my friend.

Chihiro Fushimi
Um... Your coffee is going to get cold.

Minato Arisato - Selection
It needs to cool down.
Do you want sugar?
I know.

Chihiro Fushimi
O-Oh, um... Maybe you should've ordered iced coffee, then...
Surprised - ...Oh! Sorry! I wasn't trying to tell you what to do. I-I just thought my suggestion could help a little...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Chihiro is smiling a bit.
I learned a little more about her today.

Chihiro Fushimi
Surprised - Oh, uh, yes! Could I have... three cubes, please?
Happy - To be honest, I've got quite a sweet tooth. I can never say no to anything sweet.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Chihiro is smiling again.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - S-Sorry! I didn't mean to nag...
Sad - ...It seems like all I've been doing is apologizing today... Sorry about that, Arisato-san...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Chihiro has fallen silent.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - But, um...

Chihiro Fushimi
Happy - I... I really enjoy getting coffee with you like this.
Happy - I kind of wish my time with you would just last forever...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We chatted for a while longer before
I decided to go back to the dorm.

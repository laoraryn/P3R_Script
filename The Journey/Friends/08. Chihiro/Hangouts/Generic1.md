Chihiro Fushimi
I keep thinking about that book of illustrations I found at the bookstore...

Chihiro Fushimi
The manga artist who made those illustrations always has a shy girl as their main character...

Chihiro Fushimi
Happy - And wanting to be with the boy she likes drives her to be more confident and grow as a person.
Happy - I... want to be like that too...

Minato Arisato - Selection
It's just fiction, though.
You can do it.
It sounds interesting.

Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - W-Well, that's true...
Sad - ...But you didn't have to be so blunt about it...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Chihiro seems sad.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Chihiro Fushimi
Happy - Th-Thank you, Arisato-san.
Happy - But I still have a long way to go... I'm going to start trying even harder.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Chihiro seems happy.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Chihiro Fushimi
Happy - Yes, it's really good. I highly recommend it.
Happy - Oh, and it's not just about girls. Maybe you'll have a different perspective than me when you read it.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Chihiro seems to be having fun.
I learned a little more about her today.

Chihiro Fushimi
Oh, sorry... I guess I got a little carried away talking about the manga.
Happy - Actually, if it's all right... I'd like to know what kind of books you read, Arisato-san.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We chatted for a while longer before
I decided to go back to the dorm.

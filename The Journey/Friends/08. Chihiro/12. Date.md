Chihiro Fushimi
Sad - Um... My mom called. She said she'd be home late again...
Sad - Apparently she felt bad. I think she was really hoping to meet you.

Chihiro Fushimi
She knows I'm not good with boys because of my dad... But I told her I found a boy who I can rely on.
That's why she wanted to meet you.
I'm hoping we'll be able to make it happen soon.

Chihiro Fushimi
Happy - Thank you!
Happy - ...So, what should we do today?
Happy - It... It's just the two of us, you know...

Chihiro Fushimi
......
Happy - Do you mind if I... indulged myself... just a little?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I spent a long time with Chihiro.
I feel an unbreakable bond between us...

Chihiro Fushimi
Happy - I love you, Arisato-san.
Happy - And I always will...

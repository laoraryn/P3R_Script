You know how every school has at least one mystery that no one can solve?
I'm sure our school has one, too, and I'll be the one who'll discover what it is!

You know how every school has at least one mystery that no one can solve?
There's one here too, you know...
Like the sculpture in the art room that moves by itself! ...It sounded cooler in my head.

Very Curious Student
Hey, have you heard about the ghost in the home ec room?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah.
Nope.

Very Curious Student
Impressive. You know the school well.

Very Curious Student
I heard there's a ghost in there, man.
The sewing machine will be on, but no one's inside... Or you'll hear weird voices coming from in there...

Very Curious Student
Hey, I read those ghost stories that were being spread around school on the Internet.
You know, the ones about those students who died, became ghosts, and ate humans...
Wait, how would anybody know they ate humans? There wouldn't be any remains.

Very Curious Student
I heard that those students who were sent to the hospital were bullying other students...
Maybe it was their victims who did that to them.

Very Curious Student
You remember that ghost story about the angry spirit?
Well, I guess there's another version that's different from that other one.
Did ya know that?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I didn't.
I did.

Very Curious Student
Well, I'd love to tell you it myself, but I'm kinda shaky on the details.
You know those two girls that are always gossiping in the hallway on the second floor...?
I'm sure they know the story inside and out.

Very Curious Student
I heard it's based on a real incident from ten years ago...
...and they never figured out what happened.
Don't you think that makes the story so much creepier?

Very Curious Student
Hey, have you ever heard about that creepy place located on the outskirts of Port Island Station?
Well, I accidentally ended up there once. Dude, I was so scared I almost pissed myself.
It was full of all these scary-looking guys...
From what I heard, they meet there a few times every month on Saturday nights.
But be careful if you go there, dude...
That place is dangerous. Real dangerous.

Very Curious Student
Have you heard that crazy rumor that's going around online?
Apparently, you can get revenge on someone just by signing up at a website.

Very Curious Student
That revenge request website might be real, y'know.
I know a guy personally who signed up. Well, actually, it was his sister...'s friend...

Very Curious Student
Hey, did you know there's an observatory somewhere on campus?
Rumor has it there is one, anyway... But I've never seen anything.

Very Curious Student
Hey, you want to hear something weird about the observatory?
No one's ever been there. In fact, no one even knows HOW to get there.
It's like no one was meant to go there... ever.

Very Curious Student
Don't you think there's something strange about the observatory?
I mean, no one has ever heard about anyone actually going inside of it.
And there's no trace of it ever being used.
Well, I guess if no one's ever been inside, then obviously there wouldn't be a trace of it being used...

Very Curious Student
I gave up trying to learn about the observatory.
Actually, I learned that there's nothing to learn about it.
I just can't believe the school built that thing. I mean, why build it if no one's going to use it?

I'll be a third-year soon, which means I'll be studying for exams every single day.
But that doesn't mean I'm giving up the hunt for mysterious stuff like that observatory.
Having an inquisitive mind is important for people.
And it's what makes me so interesting to talk to.

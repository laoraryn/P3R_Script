Even though the new school year just started, I feel like someone's been watching me...
I hope it's just my imagination.

Brown-Haired Student
Dude... I think that chick's checking me out...
Oh yeah, dude. She's definitely checking me out.

Brown-Haired Student
I have this strange feeling that someone's watching me...
Maybe it's just my imagination.

Brown-Haired Student
Dude, I'm so used to her stalking me now...
Like, I know she's always there, but I don't even notice her anymore.

Brown-Haired Student
Dude, that girl keeps following me around.
But she's actually pretty cute, huh?

Brown-Haired Student
Oh man...
The first thing I do when I get to school is look for her...
Then, when I finally find her, I get butterflies in my stomach...
What should I do, what should I do...?

Brown-Haired Student
Argh! I can't take this anymore!
I'm going to ask her out!
I know she'll say yes! I mean, she was the one following me around in the first place!
I gotta start thinking up plans for our date like now!

Brown-Haired Student
Well, I asked her out, dude...
And she totally rejected me! She said she didn't like me!
Dammit! I can't believe this... She was the one following me around!
Well, I'll show her! Tonight, I'm gonna...!
I'm gonna cry myself to sleep...

Brown-Haired Student
Do you see that girl over there? I think she's following me around.
Hmm... How should I deal with this?

Brown-Haired Student
You know that chick back there who's been following me?
I don't know what to do with her... So I'll just leave her hanging.

Brown-Haired Student
Damn, she's so persistent.
She must have some kind of iron will to follow me around this much.
She'd make a great detective.

Brown-Haired Student
Sometimes, that girl over there who's stalking me loses my trail.
I don't know why, but I get anxious when that happens.
Wait a sec... Am I obsessed with her, too...?

Brown-Haired Student
Hey, man, what should I do...? Every time I look at her, she seems prettier.
*sigh* I'll have to be happy with just looking at her...

Brown-Haired Student
I don't know why, man, but I think I'm starting to fall for her...
What should I do? I can't just keep doing nothing!
Maybe I should go ahead and talk to her, y'know?

Brown-Haired Student
Dude, did you see that?
She helped that brat who fell and started crying! She actually made him stop that damn bawling!
Damn... She's one nice girl...

Brown-Haired Student
Dude, did you see that?
She gave her seat to some old fart, man!
She's so sweet...

Brown-Haired Student
Dude, what's going on? That girl who's been following me all this time...
I was gonna talk to her, but she stopped following me.
I've been watching her to try to figure out why, but I don't know... Something seems off.

Brown-Haired Student
Dude, did you see that?
She helped some mangy cat that those brats were picking on!
Then she fed it some real high-class, gourmet cat food!
It's just a stray cat. Why's she making such a fuss over it...?

Brown-Haired Student
Damn! I missed my chance to talk to her.
All I seem to do these days is follow her around...
What should I do?

Brown-Haired Student
Isn't she awesome?
M-Maybe I'll just keep checking her out a little while longer...

*sigh* I'll be a third-year soon.
And then all I'll be doing is studying for my entrance exams.
That's gonna suck...
I mean, how am I going to be able to study if I can't stop thinking about her?

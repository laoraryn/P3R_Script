Oh gosh... I can't seem to look away from that guy over there.   
But... he might notice if I keep staring.

Fawning Student   
*sigh* He's sooo hot...   
Wait, why am I telling you this?   
Well, whatever. You have to admit, he is a hottie.   
   
Fawning Student   
*sigh*   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The fawning student continues to sigh...   
   
Fawning Student   
He's different than I imagined...   
From what I can tell, he has no personality.   
   
Fawning Student   
Eww! Did you see that!?   
That guy over there just picked his nose and then... flung it everywhere!   
So gross...   
   
Fawning Student   
That guy there... Isn't he acting funny?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, he is.   
Not really.   
   
Fawning Student   
Yeah... I thought he seemed weird...   
   
Fawning Student   
Really? Well, if you ask me, he seems weird...   
   
Fawning Student   
Uh-oh... That guy's staring at me...   
I hope he's not going to ask me out...   
   
Fawning Student   
You really have to be careful who you date nowadays.   
They say love is blind, but...   
There's no way I could ever date a guy like that.   
   
Fawning Student   
The first thing I do when I get to school is look for him...   
Just seeing him makes me smile.   
*sigh* What should I do...? How should I express my feelings for him...?   
   
Fawning Student   
I know I can't go on without talking to him, but...   
Maybe I would be satisfied just staring at him from afar.   
*sigh* What should I do...?   
   
Fawning Student   
Oh my god! Did you see that!?   
He just threw a rock at a bird resting on that branch!   
That's so cruel...   
   
Fawning Student   
Did you see that?   
He just threw a rock at a bird resting on that branch!   
If he keeps that up, he might get possessed by evil spirits...   
But that's just a rumor, so probably not.   
   
Fawning Student   
Did you just see that!? Look at that guy over there!   
He just spit his gum into the fountain!   
So disgusting... What is he thinking!?   
   
Fawning Student   
That guy who's been following me... Is he blushing?   
Umm, am I in trouble...?   
   
Fawning Student   
Is this what they call "disillusionment"? I didn't realize he was that kind of guy...   
I'm gonna stop following him. This is so disappointing...   
The last thing I need is another guy like him.   
   
Fawning Student   
Is that guy who keeps following me around gonna talk to me or what?   
No normal guy would wait this long to talk to a girl, right?   
   
Fawning Student   
See that guy over there? I think he's been following me around.   
What should I do in a situation like this?   
   
Fawning Student   
Hmm... It feels like someone's watching me...   
Is it just me...?   
   
Fawning Student   
God! This guy following me around just won't quit!   
He must be one stubborn guy to follow anyone around this much.   
He'll probably be a detective or something when he grows up.   
   
Fawning Student   
Huh... I still get the sense that someone's following me...   
Hey, there's someone over there. Hm, that guy looks familiar...   
   
Fawning Student   
You see that guy over there, right? You know, the one who's been following me?   
I don't know how to get rid of him... So I guess I'll just let him do whatever it is he's doing.

My third year is just around the corner.   
Time flies, huh?   
I spent the whole year stalking and being stalked.   
*sigh* I have to spend my time more wisely next year.

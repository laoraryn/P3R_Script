Oh man, this is bad... Where did I drop my student handbook...?   
Do you need something? I'm a little busy now... Hey, wait, that handbook you're holding...   
Can I see that student handbook? I was just looking for mine...!

This might be it.   
You're mistaken.   
   
Flustered Student   
It IS mine! Phew... Thanks, you saved me!   
...Oh yeah, as a thank-you, here, take this.

I got this for free when I was shopping at Aohige Pharmacy, but I don't own a cat.   
Anyway, if you have no use for it, just give it to one of the cats at the strip mall.   
   
Flustered Student   
I see... Sorry for demanding to see your stuff all of a sudden...   
Oh man, where did I drop it...? I gotta try to remember...   
   
Relieved Student   
Thanks again.   
If you have no use for that, just give it to one of the cats at the strip mall.

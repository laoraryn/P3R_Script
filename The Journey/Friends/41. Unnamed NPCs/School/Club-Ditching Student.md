I'm still thinking about it.

Oh yeah? You won't be able to join right away though. I hear a lot of them are at max capacity.   
Well, just keep an eye out for an open spot. They might start recruiting again in late April.

Well, club activities suck anyway. You have to socialize and be considerate of other people.   
I guess it's a good way to make new friends, but I also just wanna enjoy high school, you know?

I hear that, starting on the 23rd, some athletic teams will be recruiting new members...   
...Actually, it's just the track and field team. I guess the others are full.   
If you're interested in joining, why don't you go check it out?   
From the classroom, go down the stairs to the right and eventually you'll find it.

Hey, new kid. You have no idea how lucky you are.
You're surrounded by cute girls in 2-F! Like Takeba-san!

Pubescent Student
Hey, new guy...
Whaddaya think of the girls here compared to your old school?

Minato Arisato - Selection
What're you talking about?
They're all cute.
They're about the same.

Pubescent Student
I'm talking about how many hot chicks there are! Our school's girls rank pretty high, if you ask me.

Pubescent Student
I know, right? Our school has tons of hot chicks.

Pubescent Student
So your old school had lots of hot chicks too?

Pubescent Student
Dude, there are some seriously hot chicks at this school...
Which is great, but it also makes it harder to approach them.
If there's a girl you wanna date, you gotta be smart about how you talk to her.

Pubescent Student
You seem to know Kirijo-san, but...
...you're not going after her, are you?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I sure am.
Not particularly.

Pubescent Student
I don't think that's a good idea, since she lives in a totally different world than the rest of us.
I have a feeling that if a guy tries something funny, her bodyguards will break his neck.

Pubescent Student
Good. You'd have to be pretty stupid to.

Pubescent Student
Ghosts can be creepy, but they don't have to be, right?
If there was a ghost that looked like a cute girl, I wouldn't mind being haunted by it.
Well... As long as she doesn't devour my soul or somethin'.

Pubescent Student
Well, I've checked out all the new first-year girls...
They're all pretty cute... But the glasses girl in the student council is especially cute, don't you think?

Pubescent Student
I saw a girl in a gothic lolita getup in front of the station...
Man, she was so cute, I had to go up and ask her out!
I said, "Hey, wanna catch a movie or somethin'?"
But she didn't even move, except for breathing! She didn't even bother looking my way...
My ego still hasn't recovered...

Pubescent Student
You hear about that couple they found together?
Part of me is glad it wasn't me...
...and the other part is jealous, since I've never had a girlfriend.

Pubescent Student
Dude, I was tryna pick up some chicks the other day at the station, but it didn't go as planned.
It's hard when a girl has her guard up, huh? Maybe a more honest approach would work better...

Pubescent Student
What the heck? It's pretty rare for a hottie like that to transfer in at this time of the year.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Huh?
What hottie?

Pubescent Student
Dude, get a clue! I'm talkin' about Aigis!
A mysterious babe like that... I want to know everything about her! Like her measurements!

Pubescent Student
I heard a rumor that you went to Kirijo-san's vacation home.
Not only that, but Takeba, Yamagishi, and Aigis were there, too...
And the best part of the rumor is they were all wearing bathing suits! Is that true!?

Minato Arisato - Selection
It sure is.
That didn't happen.

Pubescent Student
No way! Are you serious!? Wait, don't say anymore. I can't take it!
Why!? Why are you so damn lucky!?

Pubescent Student
Yeah, I thought so. That's way too good to be true.

Pubescent Student
Dude, the mall sucks.
I was trying to pick up this girl, but some cop kept staring at me like he meant business...

Pubescent Student
Dude, I went to the middle school to check out next year's first-years...
...and the cops came after me! Can you believe that?
I got away, but I didn't get to see if there were any hotties.

Pubescent Student
Dude! That new transfer student is a total chick magnet!
I guess he does kinda stand out...
Ugh, I really hate guys who have good looks!

Pubescent Student
Dude, I was looking forward to meeting some babes on that trip.
But I guess things rarely go as you hope...
Well, at least I got to see our school's girls in yukatas.

Pubescent Student
Dude, have you noticed? Around Christmastime, people flirt like crazy.
And the magazines are filled with sappy pictures. Isn't that overkill?
Man, I wish Santa would bring me a girlfriend this year...

Pubescent Student
All those people who hooked up during Christmas are just fooling themselves.
Their relationships won't last, man. They treat each other like accessories.
Man, I'm glad I didn't hook up with anyone around then.

Pubescent Student
Dude, I was invited into that cult thing again...
I wonder who's in charge of that mess.
I bet he's a chick magnet...

Pubescent Student
I tried talking to a girl at the station the other day, and man, it was the worst!
She was a believer of that cult, and she kept going on about Nyx-sama this, Nyx-sama that...
What a letdown, man. Who the hell is this Nyx guy anyway? I wanna learn his technique...

Pubescent Student
Dude, why did the culture festival hafta be canceled?
It would've been a great chance for me to meet some girls from a different school.
Now I don't have anyone new to use my awesome pickup lines on...

Graduation is coming up. It's a waste of time to pursue anyone who's leaving.
Next year will be tough too, man! All the hot chicks won't stay single for long!
You better start planning now!

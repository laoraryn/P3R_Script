Don't you feel completely lost whenever you transfer to a new school?   
This is the second floor, and the one below has the faculty office, club rooms, and more hands-on classes.   
If you go down either of the two staircases, you'll be able to reach the front entrance.

I do.   
Not really.

Leave the classroom and go down the stairs to the right.   
Then, go through the double doors on your right-hand side and head straight.

Leave the classroom and go down the stairs to the right.   
The culture clubs like the art club room will be right there.

It's located right across the hall from this room.

Leave the classroom and go down the stairs to the left.   
While facing the shoe lockers, go right to enter the hallway where the faculty office is located.

But walking all the way to each location is quite a hassle, isn't it?   
If only we could get somewhere with the push of a button, just like in games nowadays.

What do you want? I'm a little busy here.   
I gotta text all the new friends I made today.

What do you want? I'm using my cell now.   
Talk to me when I'm not busy.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
Whaddaya want? What, you've never seen a cell phone?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Of course I have.   
Nope.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
I thought so.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
Really? I've never met anyone who didn't know what a cell phone was before.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
Anyway, I'm busy.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
Man, the spammers these days annoy the crap out of me.   
Whatever assholes send this junk to everyone, I hope they send them to prison.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
This is kinda random, but...   
Isn't it a pain having to reply to messages from people you don't care about?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, it's a pain.   
Oh, I don't think so.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
Yeah, you got that right...   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
Sheesh, you're a patient one.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
Oh yeah, that girl who passed out? I heard she was by herself when it happened.   
Seems mysterious, doesn't it?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, I agree.   
Not really.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
I know, right?   
I don't really care about other people, but if it's a mystery like this, I get pumped.   
Like I can't rest until I get to the bottom of it.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
Oh, okay.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
Three days in a row, we've had students at this school passing out. It's a hell of a mystery.   
I'm itching to know more... I should try looking into it.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
I thought I could turn up some info, but I didn't find anything at all.   
All three passed out, but they were in different classes.   
Different clubs, too.   
So my investigation isn't going very well.   
Partly because all their friends were those thugs...   
And I obviously don't want to deal with them.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
I'm getting bored of calling people up on my phone.   
It's fine for trying to kill my boredom, but to be honest, I've run out of stuff to talk about.   
Coming up with new stuff to talk about is a pain, too... Ugh, this is such a buzzkill.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
I'm thinking about downloading games to my phone, but I don't know...   
They say it's cheap, but it all adds up.   
Got any recommendations?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Try a puzzle game.   
Try a card game.   
Try an RPG.   
No idea.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
Hmm... Okay, I'll try to remember that.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
Oh... Well, whatever.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
The admin of the site I'm checking out now is highly respected.   
I guess they come off as charismatic? Y'know, having a unique username and everything.   
Well, whatever. As long as the site itself is cool, I don't give a flip what kind of admin runs it.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
I heard there's a revenge website, but... the URL is top secret, right?   
I'm trying to figure it out, so I'm looking all over the web on my cell.   
There's a local thread that seems like it has a lot of info on the site.   
But it's all garbage info...   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
My friend asked me for the URL of the revenge website, but I don't know it.   
But even if I did, why would I tell anyone else?   
I'd just keep it to myself.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
I tried out that card game for cell phones, but I couldn't get into it.   
It wasn't hard to understand, it was just too simple.   
Oh well... I'll try something else.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
Whaddaya want?   
I'm playing a shooter on my cell, so buzz off.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
Whaddaya want?   
I'm playing an RPG on my cell, so buzz off.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
I tried out that shooter for cell phones, but I couldn't get into it.   
It was too tough trying to dodge the bullets on that tiny screen.   
Oh well... I'll try something else.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
RPGs aren't that bad on cell phones.   
One game lasts for a pretty long time, so I guess I'll play it a little while longer.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
I was just playing that RPG on my cell, but I think I'm finally getting bored of it.   
I hope there are more good ones...   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
What do you want? I'm using my cell now.   
This season is so busy, I have to constantly call and message people...   
So talk to me some other time.   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
I used to take a picture whenever I saw one of those Apathy Syndrome people.   
I sent them to everyone on my contacts list, saying, "I found an Apathy Syndrome guy!"   
But now, they're as common as oxygen. It's a pretty scary thing to get used to.   
Is it going to go away someday, or are we stuck with it forever?   
   
Phone-Addicted Student   
Oh man, this sucks... My friend is into that cult stuff.   
He keeps texting me these stupid-ass messages!   
Like this one, where it just says "Nyx-sama" over and over...   
I've gotta figure out how to block his messages...

Oh, hey... What happened to those Apathy Syndrome people?   
Just a while ago, it was like everyone in town had it. Kinda felt like the world was gonna end.   
Oh wait, I'm busy messaging my friends, so tell me all about it later.

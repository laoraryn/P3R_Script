I bet midterms will be easy.   
But I'm gonna study just to be on the safe side.

If you can't concentrate at home, try going to the school library.   
It's right across from the faculty office, and it's open most of the time.   
   
Well-Behaved Student   
Well, I guess it went okay...   
Let's wait for the scores to be posted.   
   
Well-Behaved Student   
Just like I thought—my score wasn't too bad. I guess it's a good starting point.   
   
Well-Behaved Student   
It's almost time for exams again.   
But this time, it'll be a lot tougher.   
You better go to the library and study. Otherwise, you'll be screwed.   
   
Well-Behaved Student   
Hmm, I guess I did okay again... But I better do some studying over summer vacation.   
   
Well-Behaved Student   
Second semester is gonna be rough.   
I'm nervous already...   
   
Well-Behaved Student   
It was easier than I expected, but I still missed some.   
So I guess I could've done better.   
   
Well-Behaved Student   
Phew, what a relief... I didn't do too badly...   
But my scores will never go up if I don't take things more seriously...   
I'm gonna study as soon as I get home.   
   
Well-Behaved Student   
Your exam scores can affect your career opportunities, you know...   
Oh, man... Now I feel sick to my stomach...   
   
Well-Behaved Student   
Hmmm, how should I describe this...?   
I feel like I'm climbing a mountain without a rope...   
Oh man, my stomach hurts...   
   
Well-Behaved Student   
Did you see the scores? Man, I blew it...   
I wasn't the last on the list, but... it's definitely gonna affect my future.   
Ugh... Everything is getting dark...

These classrooms are also used for club activities, not just for lessons.   
Typically, it's the culture clubs that use them, but they don't seem to be accepting new members right now.

I heard Yamagishi-san fainted again, and she's taking days off from school...   
I wonder if she's okay... She doesn't look very strong.   
   
Earnest Student   
Yamagishi-san is absent today, too.   
   
Earnest Student   
There are lots of classrooms here... But you knew that.   
   
Earnest Student   
The sign on the door to the home economics room looks like it was written in another language.   
It's hard to read... It doesn't look like English...   
And if you listen close, you can hear mysterious voices inside...   
I can't bring myself to go in...   
   
Earnest Student   
There's a science teacher who brews his coffee in the test tubes...   
I wonder how it tastes... It seems kinda nasty.   
   
Earnest Student   
When I think of art, I think of landscapes, or still lifes, or things like that.   
But it seems like most of the guys just think about nude figure drawing.

That's prejudice.   
That's just how they are.   
   
Earnest Student   
Oh, I-I see... Sorry...   
   
Earnest Student   
Sheesh, boys...   
   
Earnest Student   
When I think of home economics, I think about cooking experiments, and that kind of thing.   
I hear that some people burn their textbooks by accident by setting them too close to the stove.   
   
Earnest Student   
I heard that on the 17th, the culture clubs are going to have openings for new members.   
But it seems like most of them are already at capacity, so only the art club is recruiting.   
Each club room isn't that big, so I'm not surprised that they're limiting the number of members.   
   
Earnest Student   
The culture clubs' recruitment drive seems to have started.   
Only the art club is recruiting this year. It looks like you can go take a look at their activities first.   
Culture clubs have a different feel than the sports clubs. They seem interesting.   
   
Earnest Student   
You know how you use rubbing alcohol for science experiments?   
Well, I heard there's a teacher who drinks it, saying it's as good as regular alcohol...   
But that can't be good for you! I wouldn't try it if I were you.   
Believe me, it's not worth it.   
   
Earnest Student   
When I think of artists, I think of those people who squint and hold a pencil up to their subject.   
Artists who do that, especially the guys in my class, just want to look the part...   
   
Earnest Student   
Guys never seem to be able to do much in home economics.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's not true.   
True...   
   
Earnest Student   
You mean there are guys who are good at sewing? That sounds wonderful.   
   
Earnest Student   
They're going to have trouble if they ever decide to live on their own, though.   
As for me, if my button fell off or something, I'd be able to sew it back on in a second!   
   
Earnest Student   
The music textbooks always have the faces of great musicians on the covers, but...   
The boys in my class just like to scribble on them...   
   
Earnest Student   
Sorry to ask this so suddenly, but do you like chemistry?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah.   
I'm neutral about it.   
I hate it.   
   
Earnest Student   
Chemistry is such a fun subject. I look forward to every experiment.   
   
Earnest Student   
I see...   
   
Earnest Student   
When you're mixing sulfuric acid with water, you're not supposed to pour the water into the acid.   
It's the opposite. You're supposed to pour the acid into the water, little by little.   
Trust me... That's how it's done.   
   
Earnest Student   
Happy Henry Likes Beer...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I know that one.   
What?   
   
Earnest Student   
Every teacher has his or her own personal mnemonic for the first few elements in the Periodic Table.   
I think our teacher's is one of the more unique ones...   
   
Earnest Student   
You should study some more.   
   
Earnest Student   
The other day, I saw something weird on the Internet.   
It was a high school chemistry forum that said they put a container of water in the middle of the school...   
They dropped in one mole of sodium, causing a huge explosion.   
Too bad it wasn't filmed... I would have liked to see it.   
   
Earnest Student   
Do you wash your lab coat after experiments?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I do.   
I don't.   
   
Earnest Student   
Ah, so you like cleanliness! I think that's a wonderful trait in men.   
   
Earnest Student   
My classmate didn't wash his either, and now there's a hole in it.   
You should be careful about that.   
   
Earnest Student   
Don't you worry sometimes about the stains the art students leave?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, it's gross.   
Not really.   
   
Earnest Student   
I know they work with paint, but they should still clean up after themselves.   
Every year, there's a huge clean-up effort... They could save time if they would do it every day.   
   
Earnest Student   
Really...?   
   
Earnest Student   
It's filthy in front of the art class... Can't they clean up after themselves?   
It's like that all over now, with the posters all over town...   
With all that, plus those scary cultist freaks, I don't feel safe walking around town anymore...   
   
Earnest Student   
I saw someone putting up those cult posters the other day...   
When I think about people trying to recruit me into a cult, I get scared to go into town...

I wonder what kind of chemistry we'll be doing as third-years... I can't wait!

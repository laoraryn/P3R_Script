Did you hear? The new transfer student's gonna be in 2-F.
Oh my gosh, what if he turns out to be really cute? Wanna go steal a peek?

Gossip-Loving Student - MSG_000_5_0
Oh yeah, apparently he's staying at Iwatodai Dorm—the one Takeba-san's staying at.
But isn't it kinda weird to transfer schools as a second-year? I wonder if he was a troublemaker at his last school...

-----

Informed Student
School's barely started and there's already been a student who dropped out.
She only had two years left... What'll she do if she doesn't even graduate from high school?

Gossip-Loving Student
Kind of a waste, don't you think? You only get to be a high schooler once in your life.
But it's her life, not mine. Not like it matters to me.

Informed Student
I heard that student who dropped out stays at home all the time now.
If she'd at least kept her name in the school roster, she might have been able to graduate...

Gossip-Loving Student
But if she's quitting now, it probably means she had problems during her first year too, right?
And hey, it's her life. Not like it's any of my business.

Informed Student
I heard Sanada-senpai was hospitalized...
I hope he's okay. I wonder if he got hurt during boxing practice...

Gossip-Loving Student
I bet he got in a fight! Some real fisticuffs!
I wish I could've seen it! I love watching martial arts!

Informed Student
I heard someone was attacked on the streets here...
They say the victim's injuries weren't too serious, but it's still pretty scary.

Gossip-Loving Student
So they were just attacked? Like unprovoked?
I dunno... Maybe they had it coming to them.

Informed Student
I heard Sanada-senpai's been released from the hospital.
I wonder how he got hurt, anyway... No one knows.

Gossip-Loving Student
Maybe he was faking it? He was just doing it for the attention?
Nah, it couldn't be. He's already surrounded by girls all the time.

Informed Student
I heard a girl from Class 2-E fainted.
Apparently, it was Apathy Syndrome. Kinda scary, huh...?

Gossip-Loving Student
She'd always stay out late, right? I bet she just happened to faint at the school gates.
Apathy Syndrome is so exaggerated. She'll probably wake up soon.

Informed Student
They said a girl in Class 2-C fainted too...
And I heard it's Apathy Syndrome again... I wonder if it's contagious.

Gossip-Loving Student
I already told you! She just happened to faint in front of the gate!
Apathy Syndrome is so over-exaggerated! They'll get better if you give them some time.

Informed Student
Y-You know how ghost stories about the school are kinda popular right now?
I'm not too good with that kinda stuff, so... no talking about it, okay!?

Gossip-Loving Student
It's not that scary. It was just like...
If you're the last one left in the school buildings, you'll hear a creepy PA announcement...
A sobbing old lady's voice comes from the speakers...
And if you don't leave the school within 42 seconds...
They'll find your corpse covered in bright red blood! That's all.

Informed Student
I told you not to talk about it!

Gossip-Loving Student
But if that story's true, wouldn't someone have to die like almost every day?
I mean, someone's gotta be the last one left, right? They can't all get out in 42 seconds.

Informed Student
I heard those people who fainted woke up.
So... I guess that means they didn't have Apathy Syndrome...?

Gossip-Loving Student
See? Just like I said. They were probably just sleep deprived from hanging out till late.
Can't be Apathy Syndrome.

Informed Student
My friend said that this guy disappeared from a town nearby...
He might be a victim of that revenge website!

Gossip-Loving Student
Oh, a revenge website, huh...
Wait, what's that? That sounds super bad.

Informed Student
I heard some students from this school are getting Apathy Syndrome.
This time, it's couples that were dating... It's so weird. I hope we'll be okay.

Gossip-Loving Student
Psh, couples suddenly collapsing together? That's so typical.
...Wait, that's not typical at all! And it's happening repeatedly? Holy crap...

Informed Student
The couples-only Apathy Syndrome that's been going around... I heard it was the work of ghosts.
They say that a couple committed double suicide a long time ago and now they're infecting couples with Apathy Syndrome.

Gossip-Loving Student
I don't know about that, but if it's true, I wish I could ask them why they're doing that.
I mean, they're dead! They shouldn't bother living couples.

Informed Student
I heard from my friend that there are going to be cafés and stuff at the culture festival.
My club doesn't do that kinda stuff... It looks fun, though.

Gossip-Loving Student
Those cafés and booths are so cliché.
That's so dull... They need to have some kind of twist to them.
*sigh* I hope someone comes up with a crazy idea...

Informed Student
I heard there's a typhoon coming.
It's a big, slow one... That means there's going to be a lot of damage, huh? This is going to suck...

Gossip-Loving Student
You think so? I actually want it to come sooner.
They'll probably let us out from school early, or they might even close the school. That'd be great!

Informed Student
I heard that, instead of postponing the culture festival, they canceled it entirely.
My class wasn't going to do anything special, but... I really wanted to see it.

Gossip-Loving Student
Yeah, that's some bull! I mean, I did say I wanted the typhoon to come sooner, but...
Why'd it have to come during the culture festival!? Read the room, typhoon!

Informed Student
I heard about that Aragaki guy who died the other day.
You know that place where all the thugs hang out? I heard they were all scared of him there.

Gossip-Loving Student
Yeah, I'm not surprised he was that kind of guy.
This might be a bit insensitive, but you're probably not living a normal life if you get killed like that.

Informed Student
I heard that Moriyama-san from Class 2-E is going to transfer out.
Her father's sick, right? She didn't seem sad or anything.

Gossip-Loving Student
Now that I think about it...
Even when she was acting all hyped and stuff, she didn't seem like she was really having fun.
I guess she has her own problems to deal with.

Informed Student
Kirijo-senpai's father died from an illness, right?
It's not like I've ever met him, but... it's kinda shocking.

Gossip-Loving Student
I think people are overblowing the whole thing. I guess he's a famous person and all, but...
I kinda feel bad for her, y'know? She's getting all this unwanted attention now.

Informed Student
I heard Mochizuki-kun from Class 2-F's parents are overseas for work or something.
He's rich and he's hot... unlike my boyfriend.

Gossip-Loving Student
Oh yeah? I see Mochizuki-kun's the new hot real estate, then...
But I hear he's asking out every girl. I'm not really interested if he's not serious about relationships.

Informed Student
Career experience was sooo boring... Just the same stuff over and over.
I should've just ditched. Even just being in class like usual would've been more worth my time.

Gossip-Loving Student
I know, right? And I already have a part-time job...
So it's not like I needed to learn what having a job is like. They just made us work for free.

Informed Student
Every year, when Christmas gets close, you see more couples, huh?
Well, I was the same way last Christmas, so I'm not really one to talk.

Gossip-Loving Student
At least you guys are still going strong.
I have to find a new guy already...
Every magazine now is like, "Top 10 Best Night Views." I wanna enjoy those with someone...

Informed Student
Y'know, there's a lot more of those Apathy Syndrome people lately and everything's weird...
But Christmas was super amazing! It was so pretty at Paulownia Mall, too.

Gossip-Loving Student
Huh? You went there?
Weren't you going on about eating dinner at a fancy restaurant this year?
Then again, I guess that's still better than me, who ended up spending it alone... *sigh*

Informed Student
All I read about in the magazines now is that cult stuff.
I guess the members of those things take them seriously...
It's just disturbing, seeing them popping up everywhere.

Gossip-Loving Student
Seriously. TV, Internet, everywhere... All I hear is cult, cult, cult.
So, uh... what's a cult?

Informed Student
My friend's friend is all into that cult stuff.
I heard he drew a creepy symbol in his room, and his whole family's worried about him.

Gossip-Loving Student
I haven't heard a single good thing about that cult. And I hate it when they talk to me on the streets.
"Believe in Nyx and be saved!" Get that stuff out of my face.
Do I look like I need saving? Wait... Is it because I don't have a boyfriend...?

The third semester is almost over. After spring vacation ends, we'll be third-years...
And when that happens, we can't take it easy anymore.
I think we were talking about this before, too—during the third semester of our first year?

Gossip-Loving Student - MSG_001_0_0
Yeah, the year flew by way too quickly...
I need to start studying more seriously soon if I want to get into a good college...
I think I said the same thing last year, too. Guess I haven't grown up at all since then...

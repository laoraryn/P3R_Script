That tree seems special for some reason... But I wonder why it's there.
Why is it planted here all alone...?

Oh... That drink...!
Can I see it? Ooooh... Is this the limited-edition drink you can only get in Kyoto?
Wow... Impressive!
I have to say, I love these rare drinks.
Have you seen the ?
It's only available in the fall.
You want some? Well... I can't let you have it for free.
I'll need... let's say 5,000 yen, to part with it.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Buy it at 5,000 yen
Don't buy it

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I don't have enough money...

Friendly Student
You don't have the money? That's not good.
You should always carry enough money for rare beverage emergencies!

Friendly Student
Wh-What!? Are you really going to pay me 5,000 yen for this!?
Wow, you must be a rare drink maniac!
Thanks, though! Now I can get my own rare drink!

Friendly Student
Hey... Maybe you could help out a fellow rare drink maniac...
Do you think if we made those persimmons into a drink, maniacs all over the country would like it?

Friendly Student
I see... I guess you're not a rare drink maniac. *sigh*

Friendly Student
Kansai, huh...? So even if I take the bus, it'll cost around 10,000 yen...?
Argh... How many drinks could I get with 10,000 yen?
...Yeah? What's up?
You like drinks too, huh?
But all of yours are normal drinks...
That Kansai-only drink is so rare and awesome that everyone wants a sip!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
She doesn't seem interested in
the drinks I can buy here...

Friendly Student
Kansai, huh...? So even if I take the bus, it'll cost around 10,000 yen...?

A rare Kansai drink... I wonder how it tastes...

Friendly Student
That tree seems special for some reason... I wonder why it's there...
Does it commemorate something?

Friendly Student
That tree is a persimmon tree, right? Do you think it'll bear fruit? I hope so!

Friendly Student
That persimmon tree is gonna be cut down! What a waste!
I soooo wanted to try its fruit...

Friendly Student
Some people are protesting the decision to cut down the tree!
I guess they want to try its persimmons...
Nah, there must be another reason...

Friendly Student
I saw an old man pick a persimmon from the tree!
It wasn't even ripe!

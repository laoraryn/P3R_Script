Oh, you must be the new kid. Let me give you some advice.   
Make sure you study hard for exams. There will be some tricky questions.

If you only study at home, don't you ever feel like you're not studying enough?   
If you do, then I recommend making use of the library.   
You can use the books there and concentrate on studying in silence, and it's free!

Only time will tell...   
I'm not gonna worry about my score.   
   
Studious Student   
I'm neither happy nor disappointed with my score, since it's about average.   
How'd you do, new guy?

Did you hear about the two people who were found unconscious?   
I bet fewer people will be cheating on their significant others from now on.   
After all, one of them was a man and the other a woman.   
Those are pretty incriminating circumstances, if you ask me.

Finals are a lot harder than midterms, you know.   
That doesn't necessarily mean I'll study harder...   
But we'll see. Sometimes the extra effort pays off.   
   
Studious Student   
It seems like the average score went down this time... I guess that's good for me, though.   
But honestly, I'm a little disappointed. I think I could've scored about twenty points higher.   
I'll have to study harder during vacation.

The first semester is just a warmup. The game starts for real during the second semester.   
You better use the library or study a lot at home.

This time, I know I did pretty good. I can't wait for the results.   
   
Studious Student   
I was happy with my score. All that studying I did during summer vacation paid off.   
   
Studious Student   
This test is just another small mountain on my path...   
The true challenge is the college entrance exams... Everything else is just practice.   
I'm sure we'll both study more than we ever imagined we'd have to for them.   
   
Studious Student   
That was a hard test. I'm not sure how I did.   
I guess I'll have to wait for the scores to be posted.   
   
Studious Student   
I actually did pretty well.   
Now I don't have to be depressed during the break.   
How about y— Um... You look kinda pale...   
W-Well, it's not the end of the world. Plus, you have another chance...   
So cheer up.

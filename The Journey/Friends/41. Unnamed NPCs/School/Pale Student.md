I couldn't sleep last night because I kept thinking about school starting, so I came to the nurse's office to nap...
But that nurse gave me some weird medicine instead.
I turned it down 'cause it looked really gross... Only a brave soul would dare drink something like that!

I'm feeling sluggish from staying up so late, so I came to the nurse's office to take a nap...
But that nurse gave me some weird medicine instead.
It looked gross, so I turned it down... Only a brave soul would dare drink something like that!

I'm at the nurse's office because I don't feel well, you know? But he started giving me lessons...
When I listened to his lecture till the end, he gave me a medicine I've never heard of as a "reward"...
I mean... Just let me sleep, you know what I mean?

I wonder if Mr. Edogawa will ever give out any normal medicine.
Actually, I wish he'd just let us use the bed...
By the way, don't you think Mr. Edogawa and Ms. Ounishi make a weird pair?
They always fight with each other... But for those two, it works.
Talk about one freaky couple...

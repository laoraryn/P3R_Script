Oh, did you just transfer to our school?
Right... Well, just so you know, the only person I'm interested in is Kirijo-senpai.
She looked so stunning at today's welcoming ceremony, too...

Mitsuru Superfan
Arisato-kun, when you were absent, there was an election for student council president.
Kirijo-senpai's speech was sooo cool! I voted for her!
Everyone else looks so small compared to Kirijo-senpai.
*sigh* Kirijo-senpai...

Mitsuru Superfan
I heard you were invited to the student council. Kirijo-senpai said so...
*sigh* I'm so jealous of you... I wish I could get invited.
You think I should talk to her or something...?

Mitsuru Superfan
Are you involved in the student council?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I am.
Not yet.

Mitsuru Superfan
*sigh* I'm so jealous...

Mitsuru Superfan
Huh? How could you waste such an opportunity!?
You'd get to work with Kirijo-senpai! Why wouldn't you join the student council!?

Mitsuru Superfan
The other night, I had a dream about Kirijo-senpai.
She drove me around on her motorcycle, and we cruised around town at midnight.
It was so cool! I wish I could ride with her like that for real!
I would be happy just to be run over by Kirijo-senpai! Bring on her burning hot wheels!

Mitsuru Superfan
Everyone's talking about ghosts and whatnot... I guess they're all really scared.
I'm fine, though!
If a ghost gave me trouble, Kirijo-senpai would cut it right in half!
To see her fight with a sword... I don't know if I could take it!

Mitsuru Superfan
Did you hear?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I heard.
I haven't.
I don't want to hear.

Mitsuru Superfan
Ah... Of course you would have heard.
...That any man who hopes to get with Kirijo-senpai would have to be as intelligent as she is.

Mitsuru Superfan
Kirijo-senpai would want a man who likes to study.
Maybe I should study more...
If I became the smartest in my class, she might accept me, even though I'm a girl...

Mitsuru Superfan
Whatever!
A man like you has absolutely no chance of getting together with Kirijo-senpai!

Mitsuru Superfan
I wonder if Kirijo-senpai is fluent in French...
It would be so cool if she is, with the way she looks and all...
Just imagining it gives me goosebumps! Or, as Kirijo-senpai would say, "La chair de poule."

Mitsuru Superfan
I was walking around the other day, and this weird guy walked up to me...
He didn't wear a shirt, and he had weird tattoos... I tried to look away, but...
I accidentally looked right into his eyes!
They were the coldest eyes I'd ever seen... And then he smiled at me!
God, even thinking about it gives me shivers all down my back...!
If only it had been Kirijo-senpai! I would have fainted on the spot!

Mitsuru Superfan
This will be called...
The "Pretend Like I Was Just Walking and When Kirijo-senpai Comes Out, I'll Get Close to Her" strategy!
That's my plan... But I'm all nervous now...
I know I'm overthinking this...

Mitsuru Superfan
You saw Kirijo-senpai in a bathing suit at Yakushima!? Did you get any pictures!?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah.
No.

Mitsuru Superfan
Well, where are they, then!?
Don't toy with me, or I'll sign up for the revenge request website!

Mitsuru Superfan
Oh... Some help you are.

Mitsuru Superfan
I don't care about the culture festival if I can't see Kirijo-senpai there.
I was hoping she'd dress as a man and dance with me... But I guess that won't happen.
For me, the culture festival is over before it even begins.

Mitsuru Superfan
How's it going with the student council?
Any special moments with Kirijo-senpai— I mean, do you participate in the student council activities?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I do.
Not really.

Mitsuru Superfan
Why couldn't it be me...?

Mitsuru Superfan
Huh? How could you waste such an opportunity!?
Ohhh! I wish I could switch with you!

Mitsuru Superfan
I've been thinking... Normally, if someone is hurt somewhere, they'll bring in someone new, right?
That means, if anyone in student council is hurt, I might have a chance to get in...
H-Hey, what's with that look!? You act like I'm a criminal or something!
I'm not that bad! I-I'll get her without any cheating!

Mitsuru Superfan
I heard Kirijo-senpai's father passed away... It must be very tough on her...
I wish I could help her...

Mitsuru Superfan
I hate this! I don't want to see Kirijo-senpai so depressed!

Mitsuru Superfan
Senpai! If there's anything I can do, I'd do it at once!
Even though I can't do much, I'll put my all into supporting you!

Mitsuru Superfan
...That's what I wish I could bring myself to say to her face...

Mitsuru Superfan
Kirijo-senpai has cheered up a little, which is good, but... I still feel awkward.
I couldn't help her at all...

Mitsuru Superfan
It's almost Christmas, and you know what that means—presents!
I've got a great idea! I'm going to give Kirijo-senpai a gift!
Could you play Santa for me, and give her my present?

Minato Arisato - Selection
No way in hell.
I don't want to.
No.

Mitsuru Superfan
Geez, I was just kidding... You don't have to look so serious.
She might avoid me if I did that... But it would be worth it to give her a gift!

Mitsuru Superfan
My plan called "Give Kirijo-senpai a Present" didn't work.
Which makes sense, if you think about it.
I mean, Kirijo-senpai lives in a dorm, right? The security there must be pretty tight...
I went up to the front door, but I couldn't get in.

Mitsuru Superfan
Kirijo-senpai was in a kimono over New Year's!? Did you get any pictures!?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah.
No.

Mitsuru Superfan
Well, where are they, then!? Don't joke about something like this! I'll knock you silly!

Mitsuru Superfan
Oh... Some help you are.

Mitsuru Superfan
Oh, no... Kirijo-senpai will graduate pretty soon...
Everyone's scared that the world might end, but this is a REAL problem!
How can I go on without her...?

Remember that incident about a month ago? Where everyone was standing outside in the middle of the night?
I also went outside, but I don't remember what I was doing at all.
Maybe it was because I was just worried about Kirijo-senpai moving to another country...

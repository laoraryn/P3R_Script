I don't like having a rank system and following orders, so I didn't think I'd like this cult, either.   
But when I joined, it wasn't like that at all. It's not a typical cult or some strict organization.   
It's just a guy sharing his beliefs, and people who decide to respect him out of their own accord.   
So this cult isn't as strict as I thought it would be. I like that kind of freedom.

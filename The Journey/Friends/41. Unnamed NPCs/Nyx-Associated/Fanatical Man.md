Fanatical Man
In this world, there is much filth. This is one reason we require salvation.
At this rate, even when the Salvation is at hand, the world will not be totally clean.
We must continue to prepare for that day. Heaven has charged us with preparing for the Salvation.
Our task is great, and of vital importance. Do not disturb our work.

Fanatical Man
Listen to the emptiness, and empty your own heart... You will hear a sound.
That is the sound of Nyx-sama. Her heartbeat... Her breath... Her whisper...
When the Salvation is at hand, your heart will be free of pain, and you will be at peace.
But alas, there are still many irredeemable people in the world who cling to this world and doubt Nyx-sama...
The pain in your heart will be as the burning red flames of Hell!

I usually sleep in a bed, so sleeping on a futon is a new experience for me.
But I tend to move around a lot at night. I'm worried that I'll end up kicking the girl sleeping next to me...

My friend said that this inn is haunted...
But you hear ghost stories no matter where you go. It's all just superstition.

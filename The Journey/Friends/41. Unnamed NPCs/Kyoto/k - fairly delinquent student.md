We're visiting shrines tomorrow... Honestly, why bother?
I think I'll fake sick and relax in here instead.

I tried to go to the girls' rooms at midnight last night, but a teacher was guarding the stairs.
How am I going to get up there...?

My bag's cluttered inside since I just threw my clothes in at random...
I'd better take care not to leave any undies behind. People will wonder who left them...
Especially Ekoda! I can just see him asking everyone when we gather at the station.

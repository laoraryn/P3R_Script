Hey, do you have anyone to go around with tomorrow?
Oh, wait... Are you going out with someone?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I am.
Nope.
It's a secret.

Anticipating Student
Aww... Bummer.
But if you've got a girlfriend, don't think you can fool around just because you're on a trip.
Girls get really mad when you do that, you know...

Anticipating Student
Really? Then are you trying to decide who you'll go after?
I wish I had someone cool, so I wouldn't be as bored...

Anticipating Student
Ugh, that's no fun... Way to kill the conversation there.

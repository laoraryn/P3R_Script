I can't let people see me without my makeup on...
I'll have to wait for everyone to go to sleep before I take it off.

I made sure to wake up earlier than anyone else this morning so I could put my makeup on first.
I really don't want anybody seeing me without it...

It's been a really rough three days, but it's almost over...
What, can't you tell what I'm talking about?
Trying to keep anyone from seeing me without my makeup, of course!

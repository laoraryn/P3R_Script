Ms. Toriumi
Hurry, hurry, hurry! You can talk later!
Hurry up and get to your rooms. I don't want to get yelled at for your behavior!
Surprised - Yes? Do you not know which room you're in?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I don't know.
I do know.

Ms. Toriumi
Umm, Arisato-kun... To get to your room...
Go up the stairs and turn right. Your room will be on the right-hand side at the end of the hall.
Got it? Now go.

Ms. Toriumi
Well, off you go, then. Hurry upstairs.

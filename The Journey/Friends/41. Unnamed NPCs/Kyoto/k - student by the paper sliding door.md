How come our school trip is in Japan? Dude, we've gotta go abroad or there's no point!

I hear it's Ekoda's fault.   
Every other teacher wanted to go out of the country, but Ekoda insisted on Kyoto.

Man, the hot spring is huge! It felt so good that I swam around.   
I swam a whole lap!

Dude, just because it's big doesn't mean you should swim in it.

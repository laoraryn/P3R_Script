I wonder if Kirijo-san will be all right... She's been so depressed lately.

Worried Student
I'm worried too, but we should leave her be for now. Us trying to cheer her up won't help...

Concerned Student
Yeah... You're right.
Still, it feels so heavy in there that I can't bring myself to talk about anything...

Worried Student
Kirijo-san left somewhere. A second-year came by earlier looking for her too.
I think her name was Takeba-san. I have no idea where either of them went, though.

Candid Woman
I've known that girl since we were in elementary school together. She loves fortune telling stuff.
She used to pull out these weird props from her bag...
She claimed they were her lucky charms.

Candid Woman
I didn't know she was a fortune-teller.
I guess she does look weird, sitting there all by herself...
A fortune-teller, huh...?

Candid Woman
That girl's been shy all her life. She doesn't talk to people she doesn't know easily.
Though I guess that fortune-teller does have a different air about her...
She seems like someone who has something special.

Candid Woman
Her fortunes are abstract, but she's not trying to confuse you.
You're meant to interpret them, and decide how to act from there.

Candid Woman
Well, normally, meeting new friends is something that just happens.
In this case, I guess you might rely on fortune telling, but...
It's not my style.
I'd rather look for friends on my own.

Candid Woman
Amazing! Her fortune came true...
She seems pretty caught up in the moment, though...
Is she going to be all right?

Candid Woman
Amazing...
I've got a few things I'd like to find, too. Maybe I should ask her...

Candid Woman
I know there's such a thing as lucky colors...
But we're talking about clothes, right?
I think it's okay to just choose the clothes you like best...

Candid Woman
I think all she needs to get closer to her friend is a better understanding.
She says she understands fine, but...
I'm not sure...

Candid Woman
Something new about her friend, huh...?
Aren't you supposed to find stuff like that out on your own?
I have a really bad feeling about this.

Candid Woman
She's a little too into this fortune telling stuff...
I don't think it's good for her.

You should stop her.
Why not just wait and see?
Why not just leave her be?

Candid Woman
Yeah... I should confront her, huh?

Candid Woman
Hmm...
No... I should talk to her.

Candid Woman
I can't do that...
I should talk to her.

Candid Woman
I told her she's getting obsessed with fortune telling, but she doesn't seem to listen to me.
I won't give up on her, though.
I'm her friend... She needs my help, especially at times like this.

Candid Woman
Now does seem like the time to use fortune telling...
But I wonder what she was trying to say.
"Light will pierce the shadow... Until then, have patience..."

Candid Woman
That stuff about not being able to order food without her fortune... She's just kidding, right?
Right...? Oh god...

Candid Woman
She can't go through the day without her fortune...? This is bordering on addiction.
What should I do? Maybe I should ask Mama...
Wait, wouldn't it be weird to get a fortune-teller's advice on shaking an addiction to fortune telling?
Now I'm really lost...

Candid Woman
This is just wrong...
But I can't do anything about it.
I can't stop her from doing what she thinks is right.

Candid Woman
A puppet who obeys fortune-tellers, huh...?
That sounds like a pretty accurate description to me.
I hope she wakes up soon...

Candid Woman
That girl disappeared... She hasn't even been home...
I should've tried harder to stop her...

Candid Woman
They say if you truly believe, nothing can go wrong, but...
Isn't that the way those cultists think, too?
I think it's better to decide things for yourself and not rely so much on others...

Candid Woman
A puppet who obeys fortune-tellers, huh...?
That sounds like a pretty accurate description to me.
I hope she wakes up soon...

Candid Woman
The girl that I always came here with was finally found...
But she seems like just a husk of her old self. I guess it's that Apathy Syndrome thing people have been getting these days...
I have no other choice but to stay by her side now...

Everyone's excited because school's starting, but I don't really care.
The news has been really weird lately. I even saw some policemen around earlier.

Precocious Girl
I have a new teacher, and he's, um...
We're already a little into the first term, but it still feels weird to be in the room with him.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Why?
What's he like?

Precocious Girl
It's like, he doesn't talk at all, even during lunchtime.
I'm a sixth grader! I'll be moving on next year, and I'm stuck with a teacher like this... *sigh*

Precocious Girl
How should I know? We never talk. When I say hello, he just smiles.
I'm a sixth grader! I'll be moving on next year, and I'm stuck with a teacher like this... *sigh*

Precocious Girl
My teacher doesn't assign us homework.
But we're moving on to middle school next year... I'm worried...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Don't be, it's fine.
That doesn't sound good.
Just go with it.

Precocious Girl
Really? Did you not get much homework when you were in middle school?
Maybe they're trying to relax the students...? Well, I hope I can at least graduate from college...

Precocious Girl
Yeah, there's a difference between taking it easy and slacking off.
If he wants to be popular with the students, he should just talk to them more often.

Precocious Girl
Really?
So I should just wait until the teacher changes his attitude? That could take forever...

Precocious Girl
My classes are so boring... My teacher is okay, but...
My cousin always has way better stories of her classroom.

Precocious Girl
My classes are so boring... My teacher is okay, but...
I'm so jealous of the classroom next door. I always hear laughter coming from it.

Precocious Girl
My teacher told me there's been a lot of kidnappings these days.
But he already said that yesterday... And the day before that, too.

Precocious Girl
My teacher uses special stationery, but...
It's so childish. We're sixth graders and he treats us like little kids.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Special stationary?
Childish?

Precocious Girl
Oh, just with pictures of Mr. Fox and Mr. Raccoon, and stupid jokes...
He never talks, but he doodles all day...

Precocious Girl
Like, Mr. Bear and Mr. Frog are on it, and they're rapping...
It's weird. He's so quiet, I didn't imagine he was thinking of that.

Precocious Girl
The first term is finally over.
It never felt this long when I was in fifth grade, but this one seemed to go on forever...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Why's that?
It's all in your head.

Precocious Girl
Because my teacher is so boring!
Everyone in my class wishes we had a different teacher.

Precocious Girl
It's not just me! The other kids in my class think so too!
The class next door gets to go out and play with their teacher, but ours just stares out the window...

Precocious Girl
Our teacher didn't give us much homework over the summer break.
The other classes were jealous, but... I'll be in middle school next year. I feel underprepared...

Precocious Girl
I saw my teacher at the mall. He seemed really tired.
I tried to talk to him, but he just smiled. He's so boring! He's exactly the same out of class as in it!

Precocious Girl
I better do my summer assignments. It's a good thing I don't have that much homework.
My teacher never gives out much. Though I still don't really like him...

Minato Arisato - Selection
You're lucky.
You're pathetic.
Who cares?

Precocious Girl
Well, as far as summer vacation work goes, maybe so...
But the classes are boring, so in the end, it's not a good thing.

Precocious Girl
What was that for!? You're so mean!
I have to sit through his boring lessons five times a week! I should get a medal!

Precocious Girl
Yeah... He's just another teacher, huh? It doesn't matter if I like him or not.

Precocious Girl
The second term has started... I have that boring teacher again.
I don't mind studying, but I can't stand the way he teaches...

Precocious Girl
I thought my teacher might be better this term, but I guess not.
He mumbles a lot, and doesn't have any energy, so class is really boring.

Precocious Girl
My teacher is getting all excited since Health and Sports Day is coming up.
I wish he could get that excited about teaching class... We're almost middle school students.

Precocious Girl
My teacher got upset for the first time the other day 'cause I ditched Health and Sports Day practice to study.
I don't get it... I had to study because his teaching is so bad!

Precocious Girl
My class won at Health and Sports Day. We set a new record for jumping rope!
You think it's because our teacher put all his time into practice every day...?

Precocious Girl
Our teacher came to life for Health and Sports Day, but now he's back to normal...
He's usually so calm, but when it comes to festivals, he's like a different person.

Precocious Girl
I accidentally fell asleep in class, but the teacher didn't get mad at all...
So why'd he get so upset when I ditched Health and Sports Day practice? I don't get it...

Precocious Girl
My teacher is so boring. I don't really dislike him, he's just annoying...
We're sixth graders... We're almost out of elementary school! I wish I had another teacher...

Precocious Girl
The other day, my teacher called on me in class. I just ignored him 'cause I don't like him much...
I thought he would get mad at me, like he did at that practice, but he just made a sad face...
I-It's not my fault! It's his fault for being so boring!

Precocious Girl
I was ignoring my teacher 'cause he never talks to me, so I figured I'd be silent right back.
Then he called on me and I told him so...

Minato Arisato - Selection
What happened?
Did he get mad?

Precocious Girl
It was weird. He said, "I'm in the way of you guys hanging out together, right?"
He said the reason he doesn't give much homework and why he got mad at me for ditching practice...
Is because he'd rather we have "good memories of elementary school," rather than homework.
I... I had no idea... I never thought of it that way...

Precocious Girl
No... He actually apologized to me. "Sorry I'm not good at talking," he said.
I didn't know he felt that way... And I...

My teacher is quiet, but he's so nice! He's the greatest!
When our graduation comes, I'm going to tell him how grateful I am.

Oh, guess a new school semester started. I was wondering why I've been seeing so many students around.   
The world's a strange place these days. These kids better prepare themselves for the future.

I envy you students. It's a new term for you guys.   
But for cabbies like me... it's the same thing, year in, year out.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
The same thing?   
Are you okay?   
   
Taxi Driver   
Yeah... Every season, I pick up the guys who miss the last train.   
My customers are kids twice as young as me, and then... spring is over.   
   
Taxi Driver   
I'm not feeling bad or nothin', just...   
I feel like I've done it all before, you know? Every year...   
   
Taxi Driver   
I couldn't hack it at my last job, since I'm kinda anti-social, so I became a taxi driver. But...   
When my customers try to start a conversation with me, I never know what to say to 'em.   
   
Taxi Driver   
The station workers always remind me to tell my customers to keep the station clean.   
Seems like there's a lot of littering going on these days... But I probably won't say anything.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Why not?   
Oh well.   
   
Taxi Driver   
I ain't about to lecture my customers. If I did, no one would wanna ride in my cab.   
And the customer is always right, y'know? The station people don't care about us, anyway...   
   
Taxi Driver   
Yeah. What can you do, y'know? Not like telling them to stop would change anything anyway.   
   
Taxi Driver   
I saw the news... That monorail, huh? Coulda been bad...   
I'm in the same line of work, or near enough, so I got goosebumps when I saw that on TV...   
   
Taxi Driver   
Do you know the takoyaki stand over there? It's some fine dinin'.   
Sometimes this kid from Kansai eats at that place, and even he says it's good stuff.   
Takoyaki comes from Kansai, so if a native says it tastes good, you better believe him!   
Whenever a passenger asks me where to get a bite to eat, I always send 'em over there.   
   
Taxi Driver   
Usually, cabbies work night shifts. If I don't sleep during the day, when am I supposed to sleep?   
My wife gets steamed, saying we never talk anymore. She's got no idea what I'm going through!   
   
Taxi Driver   
The other day, a passenger kept babbling about this weird stuff...   
Like some revenge website... I dunno.   
He was saying he's finally gonna get his revenge... I wonder if that site really exists.   
   
Taxi Driver   
I got a complaint from a passenger. The guy called me "reticent, unsociable, and moody."   
But when I try to talk, they tell me to shut up! This job, I tell you...   
   
Taxi Driver   
Now that it's summer vacation, I get a lot of younger passengers around midnight.   
People still talk about that revenge website thing, but...   
Is it that well-known around here?   
   
Taxi Driver   
I know summer is the best time to release stress, but you've gotta use your common sense.   
These kids think the inside of my cab is a karaoke studio or something.

Then tell them off.   
It can't be helped.   
   
Taxi Driver   
Nah... It ain't my place to lecture somebody else's kid.   
And no matter how bad their manners stink, as long as they're on that seat, they're my customers.   
   
Taxi Driver   
I don't really care how other people bring up their kids, but...   
I've got a daughter about that age, and I gotta wonder if she pulls that stuff on my coworkers...   
   
Taxi Driver   
My daughter's a high school student, but she fell in with a bad crowd. I see her midnights on the job.   
My wife yells at me to tell her to cut that out, but kids her age... They'll never listen.   
   
Taxi Driver   
Ahh... Uhh... Ehhh...   
Ah... Ah... Ahhh...   
   
Taxi Driver   
I think I had that "Apathy Syndrome" thing... I took a few days off from work.   
The night shift is getting tough, and trying to talk to my passengers wears me out.   
I want to quit, but I can't... I've got a family to support...   
   
Taxi Driver   
My coworker got into an accident. He's gotta wear a truss now.   
I feel sorry for him. He can't work until his back heals, and there's no workman's comp for us cabbies.   
   
Taxi Driver   
Ever since my coworker's accident, I've been more careful. I'm getting a bad reputation, though...   
Everyone says, "Step on the gas, man!" I tell you, this job...   
   
Taxi Driver   
My daughter was arrested. They said she was ditching school to go shopping.   
I was so tired from my late shifts that I had to beg my wife to go get her instead...   
I wish they could understand what I'm going through and let me sleep at home...   
   
Taxi Driver   
There was some drive to clean the stations up, but I don't think it's working here.   
There's trash all over, bicycles scattered on the floor... But I'm not complaining. I like it this way!   
   
Taxi Driver   
Did you see those flyers? I heard a lot of people are buying into that stuff.   
Never underestimate the power of a piece of paper. I lost my family to a slip of paper...   
My wife left me... This damn cabbie job wasn't paying enough for me to take care of the family...   
   
Taxi Driver   
Some cult is gonna save all of humanity? I wonder if they can save a lowly cabbie like me...   
I didn't realize how much my family meant to me until I lost 'em. All I want is to have them back...   
You think if I ask Nyx-sama or whatever, I'll get my family back...?   
   
-----   
   
Taxi Driver - MSG_000_0_0   
I thought about following Nyx-sama to see if I could get my family back.   
But that wouldn't have helped. It was my fault, sticking with this job and ignoring them.   
I'm thinking about going to see my wife and trying to patch things up with her.

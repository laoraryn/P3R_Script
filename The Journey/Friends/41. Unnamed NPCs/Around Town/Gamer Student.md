See that weirdo over there?
Isn't he a victim of those mysterious incidents...?
It's so creepy...
Hey, did you come for the arcade?
If you wanna know about the games, I can tell you all about 'em.

Gamer Student
Are you here for the arcade?
If you wanna know about the games, I can tell you all about 'em.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure.
Nah.

Gamer Student
Today, you can play either High School of Youth or Punch Boxer.
You can learn about dating in High School of Youth, so you can increase your Charm.
Punch Boxer is pretty self-explanatory. You'll increase your Strength if you play it.
That about covers it.

Gamer Student
Today, you can play either House of the Deceased or Real Wheel Racer.
House of the Deceased is pretty scary... You'd increase your Courage if you can stand it.
Real Wheel Racer requires nimble finger work, so it increases your Agility.
That about covers it.

Gamer Student
You can play You're the Answer today, or try Edgar's House of Fortunes.
You're the Answer is pretty difficult... It's a good way to increase your Academics.
I'm not sure what Edgar's House of Fortunes does, but I hear you gain some kinda Magic powers...?
Well, that about covers it.

Gamer Student
The games are pretty addicting! You can end up pumping in lots of coins, but you get something in return.
My strategy is to play all the games and improve myself.

Gamer Student
Arcade games only start when you put in a coin, not like the home consoles where you turn them on.
I didn't realize how they worked until my friend told me.
What about you? You got any friends who help you out like that?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I do.
I don't need friends.

Gamer Student
That's cool. Be nice to them.

Gamer Student
You sure, man?
I mean, what if you come up against a problem you can't solve on your own?
No one's perfect... You should have friends who can help, in case you get into a jam.

Gamer Student
There are more of those people every day... They're so creepy.
Maybe I should go on home...

Gamer Student
Let's see... To start the game, insert one coin...
Control it using the two buttons, and... What are you looking at?
I'm not just reading the directions, I'm carefully planning my moves.

Gamer Student
I came into the arcade the other day, and I saw this guy...
He was tossing a ball up in the air and catching it.
I wonder what that was about...
It didn't look like any kind of toy or prize they offer here.
Maybe I should ask him next time I see him.

Gamer Student
I saw a girl in a white, frilly dress the other day, in front of the station...
Don't get me wrong, I love that kind of outfit—I've got tons of figures dressed that way in my room—but...
In real life, I think it's better to dress casually...

Gamer Student
Hey, I saw that guy tossing the ball in the arcade again.
I walked up to him so I could ask what the ball was...
But he just glared at me over his sunglasses.
Then he walked out of the arcade without another word.
Man, he's scarier than I thought...

Gamer Student
My friend knows a lot about that revenge website. Like, a little TOO much, you know?
It makes me wonder if he's been using the site to take revenge...
He kept bringing it up, so I came out and said, "Isn't that just a stupid rumor?"

Gamer Student
This machine has some peculiar quirks...
The crane's claw is close to the player, so the opening and closing motions are limited...

Minato Arisato - Selection
How'd you learn that?
Okay.

Gamer Student
One of the employees secretly told me. It seems they already consider me a regular.
Maybe you should get to know the guys here. You might learn something.

Gamer Student
I guess I can't force people to care...

Gamer Student
There's more of those creeps again...
I know they'll start disappearing again soon, but it's still creepy...

Gamer Student
Man, that one was close...
I never miss now, but somehow, I still can't get it.
The claw grabs the prize, but it'll fall before it reaches the hole, or the prize just gets stuck.

Gamer Student
Hey, guess what! I finally got the prize!

Minato Arisato - Selection
Congrats.
Whatever.

Gamer Student
I basically just lucked into it, but I'm still psyched.
I'll keep training until I can get a prize even without luck!

Gamer Student
Dude... That was uncalled for!
If you keep acting like that, you'll end up with no friends.
Mark my words, man.

Gamer Student
Hmm...
I can grab it, but I can't win... This can't be a coincidence.

Gamer Student
I asked my friend if there's some trick to it, but...
He gave me the cold shoulder and told me to never talk to him again.
I wonder if I said something to piss him off...
What should I do...? I guess everyone has a sore spot that you shouldn't mess with...

Gamer Student
Hmm... I can't get the timing down anymore...
I'm so worried about my friend that I can't concentrate.

Gamer Student
I tried reaching out to my friend again.
I can't just give up after being rejected once, right?
If I keep trying, I'm sure I can restore our friendship.

Gamer Student
I managed to make up with my friend! Now I can concentrate on this...

Gamer Student
It's probably because of the holiday season, but it's so noisy here.
I can't concentrate... M-My coins...!

Gamer Student
When I get a little better, I'm gonna come here with my friend.
He's been acting weird lately... All talking about how "the end is nigh" and stuff.
What he needs is to kick back and relax, here in the arcade...

Gamer Student
Everyone's talking about how the end is coming, but I don't care.
All I care about now is this game! I'm getting a lot better at it! I can win a prize almost every time!
My ultimate goal: to complete my collection!

Gamer Student - MSG_000_0_0
I've completed the collection! My friend was surprised, too.

Hm? Can I help you? I don't think I've seen you here before...

Vain Woman
Hmmm... Hey, you're pretty cute.

Vain Woman
Hmmm... Hey, you're cute.
This club is pretty nice, huh? I come here sometimes, too.

Vain Woman
Huh? Are you hitting on me? Sorry, the answer's no.
You're not charming enough to just pick women up that easily.

Vain Woman
Huh? Are you hitting on me? Sorry, the answer's no.
You're a cute kid, but something's missing...
If you're serious about getting into a relationship, you need to put more effort into it.

Vain Woman
Huh? Are you hitting on me? Sorry, the answer's no.
A guy like you must already have a girlfriend, and I'd hate to get in her way!

Vain Woman
What are you doing, standing there like a lump?
You're about as charming as a rock. I bet the world is tough for someone like you, huh?
Try being a little more charming. It's not too late for you yet...

Vain Woman
I always thought the men in this club weren't that good-looking, but...
You've almost got what it takes to be my type.
If you make just a little more effort, I'm sure you'll notice the difference.

Vain Woman
I always thought the men in this club weren't that good-looking, but...
Ahaha... I guess I was wrong.

Vain Woman
Now that it's winter, people are thinking of Christmas.
You must be having trouble, huh?
I bet you wish you could cancel Christmas.

Vain Woman
Now that it's winter, people are thinking of Christmas.
And in your case... Well, I shouldn't say anything.
Maybe it'll work out for you, maybe it won't. My fingers will be crossed for you.

Vain Woman
Now that it's winter, people are thinking of Christmas.
But I bet it's no sweat for you.
How many dates have you got lined up?

Vain Woman
Guys who know they're charming have no problem in life.
Especially at times like this... A little charm goes a long way.
You, though... I don't know.
I hope you're relying on something besides charm, that's all I'm saying...

Vain Woman
Guys who know they're charming have no problem in life.
Especially at times like this... A little charm goes a long way.
You, though... I don't know.
You might get by okay.

Vain Woman
Guys who know they're charming have no problem in life.
Especially at times like this... A little charm goes a long way.
I'm sure you know what I mean.
I'd much rather listen to you than those cultist freaks...

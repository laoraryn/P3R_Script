Man Who Can't Get Groovy
Hey, how's it going?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Groovy.
Not groovy.

Man Who Can't Get Groovy
I see... I envy you.

Man Who Can't Get Groovy
To be honest, man, me too. I can't seem to get into a groove...
I thought I could if I came here, but I guess not...

Man Who Can't Get Groovy
Hey, how's it going?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Groovy.
Not groovy.

Man Who Can't Get Groovy
Yeah... You've gotta be groovy to come to a place like this, huh?

Man Who Can't Get Groovy
I ain't that groovy... Maybe it's because I don't usually come here...

Man Who Can't Get Groovy
Hey, how's it going?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Groovy.
Not groovy.

Man Who Can't Get Groovy
It's almost summer... I'm bummed out 'cause I can't get into the groove...

Man Who Can't Get Groovy
I can't seem to get into the groove either. It's heinous, man.
Maybe I've got that Apathy Syndrome thing...

Man Who Can't Get Groovy
I can't... get the... groove... groove... groove...
I... can't... groove... get... gro...
Ugh... Auhh...

Man Who Can't Get Groovy
I couldn't think at all for a while. I had no idea what I was doing.
Then, all of a sudden, at the beginning of the month, I was totally healed. No idea how.
But I still can't get into the groove here...

Man Who Can't Get Groovy
Hey, how's it going?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Groovy.
Not groovy.

Man Who Can't Get Groovy
It's autumn already... I'd better get my groove on.

Man Who Can't Get Groovy
Winter's coming up. It's a tough season for people who can't get into the groove...
I can't get my groove on, so it's a bummer of a time for me...

Man Who Can't Get Groovy
Hey, how's it going?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Groovy.
Not groovy.

Man Who Can't Get Groovy
I'm so jealous of you, man... I bet you've got a girlfriend.
You'll do fine over Christmas if you've got somebody.

Man Who Can't Get Groovy
I see... I can't catch a groove either.
I guess it'll be a lonely Christmas for us two dudes.
Just like every year...

Man Who Can't Get Groovy
Everybody's in the Christmas spirit, but I'm not feeling it.
But what can you do? I'm just gonna keep dancing.

Man Who Can't Get Groovy
Christmas was great!
I bought a leftover cake on the 25th and I just stuffed myself at home in the dark.
I didn't even use any utensils!
Some Christmas, huh? Hahahaha! Haha...

Man Who Can't Get Groovy
Hey, how's it going?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Groovy.
Not groovy.

Man Who Can't Get Groovy
I see... But that's just temporary, isn't it?
It can't match the Salvation that Nyx is going to bring.

Man Who Can't Get Groovy
Don't worry, your sadness is only temporary.
Nyx's Salvation will save us all.

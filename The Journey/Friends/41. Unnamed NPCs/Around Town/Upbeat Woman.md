Don't just stand there! If you're in here, you gotta dance!   
Dancing is a great stress reliever! Everything bad just melts away!

I'm a Gekkoukan student, and... Remember those rumors that were going around the other day?   
I hate hearing rumors like that. How about you?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
They don't bother me.   
I hate them too.   
   
Upbeat Woman   
Oh, really? I'm jealous...   
   
Upbeat Woman   
Yeah, I can't stand hearing those conversations...   
But when I'm here, it's all okay. I don't have to worry about a thing.   
   
Upbeat Woman   
I wouldn't mind going out with a guy who walks around topless...   
As long as he's tanned and toned, like a surfer!   
That guy I saw earlier... He was just freaky.   
Long, greasy hair, pale skin, no meat or muscle, and parading around half-naked.   
He was sooo creepy and gross...   
   
Upbeat Woman   
It hasn't thrown off my groove yet, but I'm getting kind of scared...   
You see that man there? He's so... weird.   
I knew he was weird from the start, but wow! He's really out there.   
Watch, I bet he'll get kicked out pretty soon.   
   
Upbeat Woman   
I couldn't hook up with any boys this summer. This sucks...   
Did you get a girlfriend?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yep!   
Nope.   
   
Upbeat Woman   
So you're going to leave me here, huh?   
Oh well. I'll wish you good luck as I dance!   
   
Upbeat Woman   
Ooh, a pair of loners! Wanna shake your ass here with me tonight?   
   
Upbeat Woman   
Do you worry about your exam scores?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I do.   
I don't.   
   
Upbeat Woman   
Just dance and you'll be fine! Like me!   
So what if your scores are low? You won't die! Don't worry about it!   
   
Upbeat Woman   
Great! That's how it's supposed to be!   
   
Upbeat Woman   
All those new couples at school...   
They make fun of me for being single.   
The only thing to do is dance like there's no tomorrow! It's groovy being single!   
   
Upbeat Woman   
I'm not one of those people who likes spending Christmas by myself...   
But it's worse to rush and try to hook up just for the holidays.   
I'd rather dance than waste my time like that.   
   
Upbeat Woman   
Isn't this town weird? It's all dirty and messy.   
I'm really sensitive to it... I can't concentrate anymore.   
It's messing up my rhythm.   
   
Upbeat Woman   
I'm not joining any cult. Those people annoy the hell out of me.   
If I have to convert to some religion, give me one where I can sing and dance.   
It'd probably be healthier, too.

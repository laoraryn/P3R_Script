Hello, young man. Say...
Have you heard anything about those mysterious cases of ordinary, healthy people changing overnight?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I have.
I haven't.

Skilled Reporter
Guess that shouldn't be a surprise. It's all over TV.

Skilled Reporter
Hey, you don't sound concerned at all!
How can you not know about this? You live here!

Skilled Reporter
Another victim of those mysterious incidents was found at Gekkoukan High.
Since the victim was at the front gate, that must be the scene of the crime.
If the victim was attacked somewhere else, they'd have to be carried to the front gate.
But why would the culprit do such a thing? The reasoning doesn't add up.
Anyway, there's a high probability that Gekkoukan itself is involved in all this somehow...

Skilled Reporter
I'm getting shut out on this case of the Gekkoukan student...
There weren't any eyewitnesses.
No one heard so much as a scream.
It's like nothing ever happened... Or at least no one will admit to knowing anything.
They just brush it off as a "tragic case of juvenile crime"... But I think this goes deeper.

Skilled Reporter
It happened again! I got warned by my boss just for gathering info!
I was out looking into Mr. Kirijo and Mr. Ikutsuki's relationship, and the boss called me off!
I asked him why, and all he gave me was the usual bull about the higher-ups not liking it.
But this pattern... It's similar to the Gekkoukan student incidents.
There's something else behind all this, I'm sure of it...

Skilled Reporter
A perfectly healthy person becoming mentally ill overnight...
There's no family history of it, and they haven't been in any terrible accidents.
There wasn't even any similarity to the last victims. It was a different time, in a different place.
This is one tough mystery, you know that?
But I'm gonna solve it. I will solve it.

Skilled Reporter
I hear there's a growing movement on the Internet these days...
I don't know what it's called, but this one guy is gathering lots of users around him.
I'm not sure what he's up to or why, but...
He's not just being over-hyped. This guy definitely knows what he's doing.
Maybe I should check him out sometime.

Skilled Reporter
It's such a cliché for adults to complain about how young people look and act...
You see articles about it all the time on what's corrupting the youth these days.
But that guy kinda begs that question...
I'm talking about a young man I saw on the street while doing a story. Long hair, bare upper body, tattoos on both arms...
You see a person like that and it makes you wonder if the youth really are being corrupted.

Skilled Reporter
The number of victims of those mysterious incidents is increasing.
Have you noticed the pattern to the victims so far?
Based on what's happened so far, they increase one week before every full moon...
And once the full moon is over, they all disappear. That's all we know so far.
This mystery... It's related to the full moon, I know it...

Skilled Reporter
All those Apathy Syndrome victims make me worried. If you look at what's really going on...
It's spreading through the entire country, with more and more victims all the time.
I wouldn't be surprised if there's a major policy meeting about this soon.

Skilled Reporter
My investigation into the death of the Gekkoukan student was called off.
The higher-ups... They must have heard about me looking into it.
The very higher-ups my boss kept warning me about.

Skilled Reporter
Just like the mystery doesn't take holidays, we reporters can't take holidays either.
And I think I'm close to a real breakthrough on this one...
I can't take a break when I'm this close.

Skilled Reporter
Asking around is the basic method of gathering information, but it's not going so well this time.
So, how about it? Got any info on the mysterious incident?
If you have any information, I can reward you for it.

Minato Arisato - Selection
I don't know anything.
Who're you again, Miss?
Who're you again, old lady?

Skilled Reporter
Ah... Bummer.
You've got kind of a mysterious aura, so I thought you might know something.

Skilled Reporter
Can't you tell by looking at me? I'm a journalist.
I'm trying to bust this incident wide open for the public.

Skilled Reporter
Hm? "Old lady"?
That's strange... I don't see any old ladies around here...
Just one beautiful reporter, bravely investigating the mysterious incidents here in town.

Skilled Reporter
I saw a girl in a white, frilly dress in front of the station...
It was a beautiful dress, and it offset her stunning red hair so well...
That gothic lolita style is hard to pull off, but she had it down perfectly.
Maybe I should say hi to her when I see her next time.

Skilled Reporter
The mysterious incidents happen at midnight... I'm positive of it.
I've been checking around, and everything seems to occur then.
Healthy people get Apathy Syndrome at midnight, and the first victim was taken at midnight...
There's something very suspicious going on around that time.

Skilled Reporter
When I was looking into Mr. Kirijo's death, there's one thing that bothered me.
The chairman of the board, Shuji Ikutsuki. He was found dead on the same day as Mr. Kirijo...
And he must have known Mr. Kirijo since they were in the Kirijo Group together.
There's got to be some connection...

Skilled Reporter
I looked into those people who are waiting for "the End"...
I think they have something to do with the victims of those mysterious incidents.
Which means the Apathy Syndrome victims and these people have something in common.
Then right when everyone started talking about this "End," this cult appears...
Maybe they know something about all this...
Or it could be that they're just using the situation to gain followers.

Skilled Reporter
Asking around is the basic technique for gathering information, no matter how creepy the story is.
So, how about it? Got any info on the mysterious incident?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Nope.
Who're you again, Miss?
Who're you again, old lady?

Skilled Reporter
I see... How disappointing.
You've got a mysterious aura about you, so I thought you might know something.

Skilled Reporter
Can't you tell by looking at me? I'm a journalist.
I'm trying to bust this incident wide open for the public.

Skilled Reporter
......

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The woman is smiling tightly...

Skilled Reporter
The victims of Apathy Syndrome can never get their normal lives back...
Do you think that's true or not?

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's true.
That's BS.

Skilled Reporter
That's what a lot of people think, but it's not true.

Skilled Reporter
You got it!

Skilled Reporter
The symptoms of the syndrome vary from person to person, according to my hard-won information.
Unconsciousness, loss of vitality, aphasia, mental decline...
However, some only got minor symptoms and are back to a normal life already.

Skilled Reporter
Interviewers can't rely only on primary sources. Eyewitness reports are important, too.
My favorite part of gathering information is all the unique people I get to meet.
For example, the other day I talked to a young man who spoke in a Kansai dialect.
That isn't something you hear every day around here!

Skilled Reporter
Hmmm, strange. The victims from that incident aren't going away...
Usually, they disappear after the full moon, but...
Maybe something's changed and I didn't notice?
Well, whatever it is, it doesn't seem good...

Skilled Reporter
Mr. Kirijo passed away. Officially, it was from an illness, but...
I'd be no reporter if I just believed the official story!
There's something going on here... I heard a rumor that it might have been murder.

Skilled Reporter
There was a magazine profile on the founder of that cult.
But I don't think it's worth all the attention...
It's just a little club that some kids made up.
Right?

Skilled Reporter
I've got a scoop! These incidents all started with that god in the shrine's curse!
...Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I... guess...?
Not at all.
That sounds cool.

Skilled Reporter
Our rag mainly covers these kinds of things. We're just a third-rate "yellow" publication, but...
One day, I'll get a scoop that'll take us to number one!
My boss tells me not to waste my time, though... He thinks it's impossible.

Skilled Reporter
You don't have to lie to make me feel better.

Skilled Reporter
You're funny.
But that's very open-minded of you... I'm impressed.

Skilled Reporter
A Gekkoukan student was killed... Hmmm...
This is the kind of incident that makes the headlines.
The higher-ups told me to gather information, so here I am... But these kinds of cases aren't my thing.

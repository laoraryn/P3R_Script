Fortune Telling Addict
Do you believe in fortune telling?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I do.
I don't.
It's hard to say.

Fortune Telling Addict
So, you do too?
I don't mean to say it comes true all the time, but sometimes...

Fortune Telling Addict
Oh...

Fortune Telling Addict
You should take it more seriously.
I don't mean to say it comes true all the time, but sometimes...

Fortune Telling Addict
Yeah, that's right. There's a fortune-teller in this club.
Everyone calls her "Den Mother" or "Mama"...
I heard if she tells your fortune, there's no getting a second opinion. What she tells you will come true.
Why don't you visit her?

Fortune Telling Addict
You know that fortune-teller? The one they call "Den Mother" or "Mama"?
She's got a very weird presence... It's like she's in another world.
I want her to tell my fortune, but I don't have the courage to talk to her...

Fortune Telling Addict
I had Mama tell my fortune, and it's true what they say... Her fortunes aren't like the others.
Everything that came out of her mouth was so abstract...
She never said anything like, "Be careful of this," or "This will bring good fortune."

Fortune Telling Addict
I don't really have any friends... But I'm trying to make some.
So I asked Mama how I could meet more people.
Her answer was still pretty abstract, but it helped me come up with a solution!
I'll try doing it sometime.

Fortune Telling Addict
Hey, listen to this!
I did what Mama told me, and I made a real friend!
This is so great!
Maybe I should have my fortune told next time I'm in trouble...

Fortune Telling Addict
I lost a ring in my room, and the other fortune-teller couldn't find it.
But when I asked Mama, she told me where it was on the first try!
I couldn't believe my eyes when I found it. It felt like a dream...

Fortune Telling Addict
I saw this outfit at the clothing department that comes in two colors.
They both looked great...
But I know that colors can affect your luck, so I couldn't decide.
I'm here to ask Mama which color I should buy.

Fortune Telling Addict
That friend I met after Mama told my fortune... I can't seem to get closer to her.
I don't understand. Maybe I should ask Mama for advice...

Fortune Telling Addict
Whoa, Mama's fortune telling is great!
I did just what Mama told me to, and I found out something new about my friend...
And now, we're closer than ever!
Incredible... I really look up to that woman.

Fortune Telling Addict
I think I'm depending on Mama too much these days.
There are other people who want to have their fortunes told. I can't hog her all to myself.
I guess for now, I'll stick with the fortunes you get from TV and magazines...
Those never come true, though.

Fortune Telling Addict
She worries too much...
I'm just interested in fortune telling, that's all. Why does she have to act like that?
I'm just trying to get as many fortunes as possible...
It's just sound daily planning, you know?

Fortune Telling Addict
My friend fell victim to that Apathy Syndrome.
I asked Mama if she could help me.
She said she can't "see" her, so she can't do anything now...

Fortune Telling Addict
I went out to eat the other day, but I forgot to check my fortune beforehand.
So I couldn't decide what to order. I started to sweat...
Good thing they had a magazine with a fortune telling column.

Fortune Telling Addict
Remember when I told you how I forgot to check my fortune and started to sweat?
Now I check my fortune first thing in the morning, right after I wake up.
If I forget to check it... I can't get through the day without sweating.

Fortune Telling Addict
I'm totally hooked on fortune telling now.
I can't bring every single question to Mama, so I watch TV and read magazines...
Everything I wear, and everything I eat, I decide with my fortune.
All I have to do is get as many fortunes as possible!

Fortune Telling Addict
The town is becoming strange... But if you stay here, you'll be fine.
Just listen to what Mama says, and nothing bad can happen.

Fortune Telling Addict
Mama said...
I've lost myself. I've become just a puppet who obeys the orders of fortune-tellers.
She said she can't see my fortune anymore...
I always thought that paying attention to your fortune was the smart way to live...
Have I really become a puppet?
What am I supposed to do...?

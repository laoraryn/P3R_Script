Shy Man   
Hmmm... The conversation ended so soon...   
   
Shy Man   
Should I talk about club activities...?   
No, that's no good... I already did that...   
   
Shy Man   
Gotta find something to talk about... But what...?   
   
Shy Man   
The conversation died again... I keep sweating...   
Is it because of the heat, or is this a cold sweat...?   
   
Shy Man   
The beach... She's asking me to go to the beach...?   
How did this happen? Am I really allowed to go...?   
   
Shy Man   
Why am I like this...? How many months has it been dating her?   
   
Shy Man   
"What's more important to you, soccer or me?" A-A question like that...!   
She must be unhappy with me...   
But why...? Is she really...?   
   
Shy Man   
I asked her on a date, but she said no, saying she didn't want to go into town...   
Is it because it's getting cold, or is it something I did...?   
Argh... I don't know...!   
   
Shy Man   
Going to the mountains...? Did I really say that?   
But to really get the mountain experience, we'll need two days and one night at a hotel...   
I mean, no! No no no! We've got to get back before sunset...!   
   
Shy Man   
I-It's cold...   
L-Let's hold hands or something...   
N-Never mind! Forget about what I just said!   
   
Shy Man   
*sigh* What was I thinking...?   
Even if it seemed like a good chance, I can't believe I actually said that...   
But I can't let things stay the way they are forever...   
   
Shy Man   
The whole town has been feeling off lately...   
*sigh*... I'm getting worried...   
I wonder if she's okay... She's acting the same as usual...

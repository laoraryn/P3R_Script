He seems like an interesting guy, but he's a really bad conversationalist.
I'm a little worried about him, since this is the time of year to make new friends.

Calm Woman
My boyfriend plays soccer at his college. I guess my taste in men is pretty standard...
He's not that good at soccer, though. He's still a third-stringer.
Don't you go to Gekkoukan? Are you in any clubs?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I am.
I'm not.

Calm Woman
Good luck, then.

Calm Woman
Well, it all depends on your personal taste.
You get to meet more people if you join a club, though.

Calm Woman
He's really overthinking this. He looks suave, but he worries what other people think too much.
I mean, I love that he cares about my opinion, but...
I think I'd prefer it if he didn't feel so nervous with me.

Calm Woman
He's sweating a lot now, but he's usually not like that.
That type of guy is pretty popular with the older ladies who work here.
Everyone remembers his face. I was surprised, to be honest.
It's amazing how many people say hello to him at shops...

Calm Woman
He's a sweet guy, but he seems to be holding back. It's like he won't allow himself to enjoy life.
Even after his friend and I offered to take him to the beach...
He just keeps turning us down, over and over... He'll never have fun that way.
But don't get me wrong, I won't leave him.

Calm Woman
It's that time of the year, huh?
Do you have a girlfriend? I bet you could get one if you tried.
You can do it! Just find someone you're interested in and talk to her.
Even he managed to do it, so you should have no problem.

Calm Woman
That guy is just the type to take a question like that seriously.
I was just testing him, though...
But I think you'd do fine in a situation like that.
It's a trick we use to get the guy closer to us.

Calm Woman
Since we couldn't go to the beach this summer, he suggested we go to the mountains instead.
So I reminded him, and, well...
He got like this. It's so like him...

Calm Woman
I was about to tell him, "Okay," but...
I was so surprised that I pulled my hand out.
Did I do something wrong...?

Calm Woman
Love won't blossom if you just wait for it to happen.
If you want to get to know someone better, you have to put the effort in.
He isn't very assertive, so our relationship hasn't grown even a little.
But I don't mind, really...

Calm Woman
It sounds preachy to talk about moral stuff like this, but this is when people's bonds are tested.
At times like this, when the whole town is going crazy and there's nowhere to run...
I'm thankful he's here with me.
What about you? Do you have anyone who will stay with you?

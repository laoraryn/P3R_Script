Who the hell are you? I ain't ever seen your ass 'round here before.
This ain't a place for little kids like you. Beat it.

Fierce-Looking Delinquent
Who're you, candy ass?

Fierce-Looking Delinquent
Apathy Syndrome? Oh yeah, that bug that's goin' around these days.
My buddy's dad has that thing...
I dunno what to tell the poor son of a bitch.

Fierce-Looking Delinquent
Sometimes, Gekkou dumbasses come here in uniform. They better change clothes before they get their asses kicked.
What kinda prissy-ass idiot wears their school uniform here? They blind or somethin'?

Fierce-Looking Delinquent
I remember this one dude who's different from the rest...
He comes here, but he never talks to anybody. He just sits in his little corner.
I wonder what he's up to...

Fierce-Looking Delinquent
I heard some shit went down here, our guys against the Gekkou morons.
That wasn't you, was it...? Nah.
You don't look like you could piss those guys off that bad.

Fierce-Looking Delinquent
My buddy says these three weirdos come here a lot, but I haven't seen 'em yet.

Fierce-Looking Delinquent
Looks like those three weirdos've been snooping around here.
Guess they're tryin' to hear the juicy stuff... The stuff you don't find out about in normal life.

Fierce-Looking Delinquent
I saw those weirdos talkin' to that asshole Aragaki the other day...
They tight or somethin'?

Fierce-Looking Delinquent
You gotta show some respect when you're talkin' to one of my gang.
But those three guys were actin' like they owned the place.
What's their problem...?

Fierce-Looking Delinquent
Dude, those three just don't fit in.
I mean, yeah, it's not like I'd fit in anywhere but this place. The hell else would I be here?
But for guys to be out of place HERE? Shit, dude...

Fierce-Looking Delinquent
The nutjob trio is down to two.
That gothic lolita chick, yeah? Disappeared without a word.

Fierce-Looking Delinquent
That long-haired freak is up to his ass in tats.
It's not like mine, just a word or two. He's got 'em up and down both arms.
I could never go that far, man. Truth is, I don't like needles.

Fierce-Looking Delinquent
One of those Gekkou dudes... Yeah, Aragaki. I heard he got in some kinda accident and died.
I heard it happened here, too.
I don't care much what goes on around here, but...
Thinkin' about this bein' the place where he was killed really creeps me out.

Fierce-Looking Delinquent
That four-eyes who's always got that attaché case...
What the hell's in that thing? It better not be dangerous...
Man, who am I kiddin'? He's one of those three. What else would it be?

Fierce-Looking Delinquent
I don't see those two so much anymore.
Thank god for that, man. They annoyed the shit outta me.

Fierce-Looking Delinquent
I bet those two... or three, whatever... thought they were King Shit.
The way they strutted around here in those messed up clothes...
They had to think like that, or they never woulda been able to do the stuff they did.

Fierce-Looking Delinquent
Don't you think stuff's been kinda messed up these days, dude?
Like that apathy thing... It just keeps gettin' worse and worse.

Fierce-Looking Delinquent
I don't give a shit about the new year or anything, man.
Some of those guys go up Mt. Fuji out of habit, but...
I ain't never did that, and hell if I ever will.

Fierce-Looking Delinquent
The town's been looking like a garbage dump, and I heard it's all those cult dudes' fault.
All that graffiti shit... I mean, we do it too sometimes, but...
Not this much! They must be outta their minds.

Fierce-Looking Delinquent
Dude, did you see that magazine!? It has that freak's face on it!
You know, the long-haired asshole who used to come around here!
That's their friggin' savior!?
Those guys got no sense of humor... This is the worst joke I ever heard.

Fierce-Looking Delinquent
Dammit... That stings pretty bad... Just my friggin' luck... Huh?
The hell do you want? Can't you see I'm not really in the mood for talkin' right now?
Wait... What do you got there? Bandages? Heh, perfect timing. Can I have 'em?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Give them to him
Don't give them to him

Fierce-Looking Delinquent
Thanks, man! Whew... Well, that should work for now.
Hm... Feelin' like I owe a punk like you doesn't sit right with me...
...You're a student, right? Guessin' Gekkoukan, if you're from around here?
Here. I'm not thankin' you or nothin', but you can take this.
I picked it up over at the station... Not like it's worth anything to me anyways.

Fierce-Looking Delinquent
Tch, you little bitch... If you don't got anything for me, then get the hell outta here.

Heh, looks like that cult is history after those three weirdos were sent packin'.
Everything's finally back to normal.
I'm bored as hell, but it's better than goin' through all that shit again.

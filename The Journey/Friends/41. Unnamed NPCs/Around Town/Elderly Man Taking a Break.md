Elderly Man Taking a Break
Hello there. My, my, you look like a pleasant young'un.
What are you doing at a shrine, though? You don't look like the prayerful type...
Me? Well, I've come a long way to pray to the god here. He's a strong one!
The offertory box and the written fortunes both bring great blessings.
Then there's Inari-san by the red gates... Whoo! Some crazy things might happen if you pray to him.
But you have to pray for a long time... It's no problem for me, but some people might be too busy.

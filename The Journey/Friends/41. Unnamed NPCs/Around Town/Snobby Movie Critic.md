The movie theater here shows a different movie every day.
Movies are great! You can use what you learn from them to improve yourself for just a bit of money and time.

Do you like movies?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I do.
I don't.

Snobby Movie Critic
Me too! Movies kick ass!
I love them because they're like a microcosm of real life.

Snobby Movie Critic
Man, that's sad... Later in life, you're going to regret not having seen lots of movies.

Snobby Movie Critic
That guy next to the vending machine... He looks real depressed, doesn't he?
I get depressed too, when I feel like I wasted my money to watch a crappy movie, but...
That's taking it to the extreme. Kinda freaks me out.
Is this what people keep talking about? That Apathy Syndrome?

Snobby Movie Critic
All these new movies were released during Golden Week, but...
They all sucked!
I'm sure everyone else who wasted their money on those turkeys is saying the same thing.

Snobby Movie Critic
The monorail was nearly in a big accident the other day. I heard it was just a few feet away.
It's just like one of those action thrillers, you know?
Whoever stopped that train is a real-life hero!

Snobby Movie Critic
You know those incidents where people get Apathy Syndrome, right?
Those guys look so weird... They're all over town.
If it was a sci-fi movie, it'd be aliens doing it. If it was a thriller, it'd be some secret organization.
...But it's real life, so I have no idea what's happening.

Snobby Movie Critic
I sometimes see this girl sitting right over there, drawing.
She has red hair and a white, frilled dress... She stands out like a sore thumb.
But just writing her off as some kind of weirdo doesn't sit right.
It feels like I'm in a scene from a movie whenever she's there. I kinda like it...

Snobby Movie Critic
You know how, in movies, you see bodyguards with tattoos on their arms, and you know they're badass?
Well, I saw a guy like that in town. His arm was just completely covered in tattoos.
He wasn't built like a bodyguard, though...
He was rail-thin... Plus, he wasn't wearing a shirt. Really stuck out from the crowd.

Snobby Movie Critic
A movie's theme song is very important.
The quality of the movie is greatly affected by whether its theme song is any good or not.
Which reminds me... Long ago, I heard there was going to be a Gekkoukan theme song.
I think it was called "Gekkoukan Boogie," or something like that. I heard it was nearly done.
I want to hear how it turned out, but who the hell names their song "Boogie"...?

Snobby Movie Critic
When you hear cicada sound effects on a show or a movie, doesn't it remind you of summer?
Did you know they usually cut the cicada sounds out when exporting movies or TV to other countries?
In places with no cicada, when they hear that sound, they think it's just static or white noise.

Snobby Movie Critic
Here's a question for you!
Why do you think I'm so reluctant to catch movies at the theater during the summer?

Minato Arisato - Selection
It's cold inside.
Summer blockbusters suck.
Profits are receding.
The owner's going bald.

Snobby Movie Critic
You got it! They blast the air conditioner all day in there!
I gotta bring a jacket even in this hot summer weather.

Snobby Movie Critic
Well, that's true sometimes, but it doesn't really have to do with summertime.

Snobby Movie Critic
How would I know!? That's a terrible joke...
If this place goes out of business, I don't have anywhere else to go!

Snobby Movie Critic
Who cares?
And who is this owner anyways? I'm here all the time, but I've never seen him before!

Snobby Movie Critic
Man, there are more and more of those people... But I'm getting used to them now.
All they do is say, "Ahh," and, "Uhhh," but they don't do anything.
I think it'd be cool if they started attacking us, like one of those horror movies.

Snobby Movie Critic
It's September, and it's time for a new term. Did you get any transfer students?

Minato Arisato - Selection
We did.
Nope.

Snobby Movie Critic
I'm jealous... Your school life is just like a teen movie.
You're a lucky kid. Go enjoy school while you can.

Snobby Movie Critic
I thought not. Transfer students are usually pretty rare.

Snobby Movie Critic
Popcorn is a staple for the movies, but I don't really eat the stuff.
I can't be totally focused on the movie when I'm eating something.
Though I guess some people can't focus if they're hungry...
But that's when you need the moviegoing spirit! My passion for movies can overcome any hunger!
Seriously!

Snobby Movie Critic
Man, wasn't that typhoon nuts?
If it was a disaster movie, I'd be all for seeing those destructive winds...
But I'd rather not experience that in person.

Snobby Movie Critic
I understand kids fighting, but murder is going too far.
They make social dramas about this kind of thing, but...
I never thought it would happen around here.

Snobby Movie Critic
It's the time of year when young couples come out to the theater together.
But oh, do they underestimate how graphic "romance" in movies can get!
After the movie, they come out all awkward and silent!
Gets me every time. Heheh!

Snobby Movie Critic
Gekkoukan's chairman died from falling from the observatory...
Usually, it's the bad guys who tend to die by falling from a high place, so...
Nah, that can't be right. I guess I've been watching too many movies.
I should be praying for him...

Snobby Movie Critic
I heard the Gekkoukan class trip was the other day. School life... I get a little jealous.
It puts me in the mood to watch those teenybopper love flicks.
*sigh* Whatever happened to that genre of movies, anyway...?

Snobby Movie Critic
It's that time of the year when there's nothing but reruns on TV.
But reruns aren't so bad, man.
They make you nostalgic for your younger days, you know?

Snobby Movie Critic
What would you do if the world was going to end?
I would just have fun, man. I mean, we're talking about lowering the curtain on all life.
I imagine it saying, "THE END," in big letters, and then a blooper reel from my life will start rolling.
If you think about it that way, it sounds a lot more fun, right?

Snobby Movie Critic
Sorry, but I don't believe in that cult stuff.
"Nyx is coming down"? I mean, what the hell, you know? There's only one thing that comes from the skies...
That's right! UFOs! When it comes to invasions from above, accept no substitutes!

Some real weird crap happened a month ago, huh?
Like when all those people went outside at midnight? What was that all about?
Though, to be honest, it was kinda cool. Felt like the climax of a movie.

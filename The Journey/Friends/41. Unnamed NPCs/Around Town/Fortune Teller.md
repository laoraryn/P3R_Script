Fortune-Teller
Hmm... I feel a strange aura around you...
In my mind, I see visions... People's pasts, presents, and futures...
For most people, I see clearly and far ahead...
But you are different... Your future is filled with both blinding light and stagnant shadow...
I can see but a small portion... What lies beyond that is shrouded in mystery...
What a peculiar fate you carry...
Now, young man... Bearer of light and shadow...
If you wish to know more about the near future... come and talk to me...
I will share my limited visions with you...

Fortune-Teller
Now, tell me... What shall it be?

Fortune-Teller
Would you like to know your fortune?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yes, please.
No, thanks.

Fortune-Teller
Then let us begin...

Fortune-Teller
Let us hope that you find fortune in your destiny...

Fortune-Teller
Come back any time...

Fortune-Teller
You have pulled fate's trigger...
The bullet passes through many, heading directly to its target...
What target that may be, however, is unknown to me...
You must find that out for yourself...

Fortune-Teller
A long rail under the empty sky... On it stands youth in disarray...
You seem to live a tumultuous life...
What do you see at the end of the rail...?

Fortune-Teller
I feel another change...
A strong wind blows across the world, sending a blue flower's petals into the air...
How will you interpret this wind...?
As a weak and frail breeze, or a brave and mighty gust...?

Fortune-Teller
It seems you have made another friend...
A late-night affair, unseen by all... A bond made in the darkness, where the shadows lurk...
The result of this bond is too distant to be seen...
The only way to know how it will end is to see for yourself...

Fortune-Teller
Shadows within shadows... Many shadows crawl amidst the immense shadow...
Twelve shadows feasting upon the heart of man... Monstrous, yet dignified...
They gather around you... Beware...

Fortune-Teller
Guns scattered in the billowing shadow... Arms reach in to grasp them...
Their muzzles pointed at different shadows; their triggers pulled on different occasions...
Where do you point your gun? What will occur as a result of its firing...?
Can you collect all the guns that have been scattered...?

Fortune-Teller
I see a girl...
She stands between light and dark, life and simulacrum...
She falters... as if not knowing on which side she belongs...
Hm...? She is trying to tell you something...
Can you hear her words...?

Fortune-Teller
Three blades close in on you, tearing the shadow apart... A brave howl confronts them...
Things seem to be stirring around you once again...
There is more...
In the depths of the abyss, another blade watches you closely...

Fortune-Teller
A dark past sinking into the deep shadow...
It enfolds the people who are involved and captures them...
Who are the ones that are trapped...?
Hard though I try to see them, my vision blurs, and everything becomes obscure...
Can you see...?

Fortune-Teller
The golden sky spreads outside the window... A girl holding a world of white in her slender arms...
A boy struggles, searching to find meaning in himself and the girl...
But the conclusion has not yet been written... It is entrusted to the girl and her white world...
You must stand firmly, and watch things unfold...

Fortune-Teller
After the storm comes not calm, but another trial...
Do not despair, however...
I sense strong forces at your side, even more so than before...
Be brave, and confront this hardship with unshakeable resolve...

Fortune-Teller
A light has disappeared... The shadow grows darker...
But the lost light's will lives on in a strong, new light...
You have reached a turning point... The light has begun to challenge the shadow...
Your time is coming... soon...

Fortune-Teller
A strong wind blows across the world, sending a blue flower's petals into the air...
The flower discovered the world, made friends to protect, and has become another light...
The lights are gathering around you... Be prepared...

Fortune-Teller
A bridge lit by the full moon... Songs of victory echo in the air as the shadow is overcome...
Go... Now is the time for celebration...

Fortune-Teller
Under the fat crescent moon... a feeble light at the hollow tower...
A gunshot rings out, shattering my vision into a thousand pieces...
I am sorry... I can see no further...
But I can say this... The shadow yet remains...

Fortune-Teller
Oh...? Is this a new friend...?
How mystifying... No one can see into his essence...
No one, save for one girl...

Fortune-Teller
The answer and the secret to life are passed on, one life to the next...
Two lights now pierce through the shadow...
The hour draws near... How do you fare...?

Fortune-Teller
A girl falls under the full moon... A boy walks amidst shadow, and he himself is shadow...
A child who bears shadows within...
The immense shadow approaches... Its depth unfathomable; its extent without limit...
It comes to end all things... The darkness hidden by the shining heavens...
How will you stand against such a fate...?

Fortune-Teller
You have pulled the trigger of fate...
I see it now... The target was the shadow of impending doom...
Your goal is now clear...
Keep your flame of life ablaze until the end...

Fortune-Teller
I see nothing...
No... What I see is nothingness... It is the void...
But do not lose heart... Emptiness is not necessarily the end...
The void is infinite... as is the universe...
Whether this marks an end to all things or a beginning...
It is in your hands...

Minato Arisato - Selection
I want to know my fortune.
I want to know my future.
No, thanks.

Fortune-Teller
Too much of a good thing can turn things for the worse... The same is true for fortune telling.
You have already learned of your fortune for today... Return another day if you seek it again.

There are all kinds of shops here at the Iwatodai strip mall.
If you're craving delicious food, then head to Wakatsu! There's also Hagakure, a famous ramen shop.
You can also find dessert here, and burgers, and...
Hehe, sorry, I'm just going on about food, huh. Guess it's eating time! Just kidding.

If you swirl seafood ramen around six times clockwise and six times the other way without spilling...
If you do that with Hagakure's ramen, I heard you'll end up with the person you like!

Rumor-Loving Girl
If you drink a whole bowl of Hagakure's soup, you can see the word "WIN" at the bottom.
If you trace those letters with your chopsticks, I hear it makes you stronger in fights!

Rumor-Loving Girl
At Hagakure, try ordering cold ramen by saying "cobra men" to the waiter.
If he understands what you said, I heard you won't get heatstroke.

Rumor-Loving Girl
Order ice cream at the sweets shop and eat it without stopping, even if you get a brain freeze.
If you do that three times in a row... you'll get a stomachache. I mean, duh...

Rumor-Loving Girl
When you order a pork cutlet set and there's cabbage on top...
Write a dollar sign on top of it, and I hear your allowance will increase!

Rumor-Loving Girl
When you order a medium beef bowl, order a raw egg with it and drop it onto the beef bowl.
If you can get the egg in the middle of the bowl, I heard you'll become more popular in school.

Rumor-Loving Girl
Order the large fries at Wilduck Burger and make a "W" out of four of them, or an "M" if you're a girl.
Think of the one you love and eat the fries. Then you can't fail!

Rumor-Loving Girl
Those people who just stare at you frighten me...
But it's okay! I'll order the chili garlic fries and make a cross! It drives them away... or so I hear.

Rumor-Loving Girl
I heard when you buy takoyaki from Octopia and share it with your loved one...
You'll break up. So, how's your relationship going?

Rumor-Loving Girl
If you do something bad to the sweets shop's mascot, Azuki-chan...
You'll lose control of your bladder! She might be cute, but don't think you can deface her!

Rumor-Loving Girl
You only get the special miso soup if you order the fried shrimp set.
I hear that sometimes, you'll find a real pearl in that soup!

Rumor-Loving Girl
I heard if you eat a bowl of ramen without setting it on the table...
You'll be a master thing-holder. But it must be tough, since it's so heavy and hot...

Rumor-Loving Girl
My mom is saying all this weird stuff.
Something about the End, or the Salvation, or something...
I don't understand adults.

Rumor-Loving Girl
Now my dad says all that weird stuff, too...
He's right there with my mom, saying the end is coming...
I don't wanna go home...

Rumor-Loving Girl
My mom and dad keep saying this weird phrase...
"Believe in Nyx-sama and be saved!"
But... who's Nyx-sama?

Did you eat the special Hagakure ramen? I heard that if you eat it with a friend...
You'll be friends forever! It might just be another rumor, but...
When I'm as old as you, I'm gonna go have some with my friends.

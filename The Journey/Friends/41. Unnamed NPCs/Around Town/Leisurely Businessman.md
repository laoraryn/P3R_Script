There are so many great shops here, I can't help but swing by.   
Oh, uh... I'm out here for work right now. I'm not slacking off.

I was in a meeting and I heard someone talk about those Apathy Syndrome guys...   
They say there are more and more of them.   
A guy could be totally healthy, and then bam! He's got Apathy Syndrome.   
Personally, I think they're just overworking themselves, but...   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
Want to know something cool?   
You know this place is called Paulownia Mall, right? Well, you know how it got that name?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I do.   
I don't.   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
Wow, you're not some average student. Kids like you give me hope for the future.   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
A paulownia is a type of plant, and part of the Kirijo name comes from the character for "paulownia tree."   
Since this place is under the ownership of the Kirijo Group, that's how it was named. Get it?   
I may look like a slacker salaryman, but I know some surprising things.   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
I'm keeping up the pretense of going to work.   
I-I can't let my wife and little girl know that I've been laid off...   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
I heard the rumor about Mr. Kirijo.   
To tell the truth, Mr. Kirijo owned the company I used to work for, but...   
It's none of my business now.   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
Those were the good ol' days...   
I'd come here with my wife and little girl, do some shopping, and eat before going home...   
That'll probably never happen again...   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
As you can see, I'm just a salaryman.   
I'm not just skipping work.   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
Ahh, I love the outdoors.   
Breathing the fresh air, walking around on foot... It's healthy.   
You can even get a bite to eat at the café, or the burger place.   
Yup, I love being outdoors... even if it means skipping work.   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
I was skipping work the other day and I saw this young man...   
He had long hair and no shirt on... Made me do a double take.   
He was like one of those hippies from back in the day... Is that look coming back into style?   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
Gosh... Look at all those Apathy Syndrome guys...   
They're skipping school and work, right?   
That's nice... I wish I had Apathy Syndrome too...   
Then I could sit here all day long, just like them...   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
I was talking to someone from the Kirijo Group the other day and we got to talking about that girl.   
You know, the owner's daughter, Mitsuru-san. I heard she goes to your school.   
Did you know that?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I did.   
I didn't.   
I know her.   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
I guess you students know more than me, then.   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
Well, even if you did know, it's useless knowledge. She's way above us lower classes.   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
What!?   
I've never known anyone as lucky as you, kid.   
I'm so jealous... I'd skip work too often to meet anyone as high-class as that.   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
Everyone thinks those ghost stories and Apathy Syndrome are so bad, but...   
Personally, they make me jealous.   
The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer. We working class are just worked to the bone until we wither away...   
If you're going to wither and die anyway, getting Apathy Syndrome sounds like the better option.   
Heh, someday you'll have jobs like mine and reach the same conclusion.   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
I guess I've been laid off... They told me the company is being "restructured"...   
Laid off used to mean temporary release, but nowadays, it's a euphemism for permanent release...   
I may not look it, but I worked my ass off for that company...   
Everything feels so pointless now... I can't get my thoughts straight...   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
I wonder how long my money will last...   
I'll eventually have to get another job, for my wife and daughter, huh?   
But I can't seem to make the effort... I'm so burned out after what happened...   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
I saw one of my old coworkers a while ago and asked how he's holding up after the restructuring.   
Apparently, they just filled the manager positions with a bunch of yes-men who weaseled in with their connections.   
It's important to have a supportive workplace, but that's taking it too far.   
You're young. Make sure you keep it real with your friends and build true relationships.   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
I don't know when it happened, but this town is a mess lately.   
Since my life is a mess too, it feels like I'm not alone anymore.   
Hm? My family?   
Ugh, I feel like the worst person alive... I'm lying to my wife and my daughter...   
I loved my family, but now it's like they're just baggage...   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
I did some research on the Internet and read some books, and I've got everything planned out now.   
I wish I could shake the hand of the guy who invented life insurance.   
Converting people's death wishes into money...   
I haven't completely decided to go through with it, and I don't know if I'll tell anyone when I do.   
But just in case, wish me luck.   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
I heard about the disaster from someone I know who works at Gekkoukan High.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Oh yeah?   
What disaster?   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
I think it's awful the way those students are falling victim to Apathy Syndrome.   
It's probably because of all the excess studying.   
Why would they study so hard...?   
I hope they don't have delusions of going to a famous university and getting a high-paying job...   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
Wow, I admire your apathy.   
That's the spirit! Whatever happens around you, just don't give a damn about it.   
An attitude like that will come in handy once you enter the workforce.   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
I sometimes see a girl drawing here.   
She looks a little strange, but it's not like I care.   
She's so mysterious... It's like she lives in a different world.   
She doesn't care what other people say. She's living on her own, not following anyone's orders...   
As a salaryman who follows orders for a living, I'm naturally jealous...   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
Ouch... It still hurts.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Are you all right?   
What happened?   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
Thanks for your concern... You're a nice guy, unlike the kids I saw earlier...   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
I was a little tipsy last night at midnight and ended up at the gang spot.   
I thought kids were too cool to steal from middle-aged men now...   
But they beat me until I could barely talk anymore.   
What kind of society is so vicious to its weaker element? I feel like I've lost the will to live...   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
I heard something interesting from one of my coworkers.   
It seems there's this strange website on the Internet...   
He was reluctant to give me any details, so I don't really know anything about it.   
All I know is that it has something to do with revenge...   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
I found that website. The one about revenge.   
I immediately thought about getting revenge on my boss, but... I chickened out...   
I closed the tab right away. Now I'm not even sure if I had the right URL...   
   
Leisurely Businessman   
Isn't it tough to wake up early every single morning to pack me lunch? Why don't you take a day off for a change?   
I'll be fine without it.   
...That's what I told my wife. I feel a little better now.   
I don't have to feel guilty while eating the lunch she made me.

Leisurely Businessman - MSG_000_0_0   
I decided to get another job, but I've been keeping it secret from my wife and daughter.   
So even if I don't succeed, I've got a plan B.   
I guess that's how the world works.   
People think nothing of ruining someone else's life...   
I've just got to do my best. I'll deal with what happens when it comes.   
What about you kids? Are you satisfied with your lives?

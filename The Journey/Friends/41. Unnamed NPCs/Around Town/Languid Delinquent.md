Man, it's the same ol' BS every spring...
Kids who don't know crap come wandering onto our turf.

You dipshits better watch yourselves. If we see your face around here too often, someone's gonna get hurt.

Languid Delinquent
When you have that apathy thing, it's like you're too lazy to do anything, right?
So what's the matter with them that they can't see a doctor?
I mean, I ain't never been to med school, but it's gotta be worth a try.

Languid Delinquent
I guess it's all right to come here in your uniform if it's, like, after school or durin' the day.
But at night? You've gotta be shittin' me!
Dude's gonna get knocked flat for dressing like that.
Y'might say it's in violation of our whaddayacallit, dress code. You better look out, too.

Languid Delinquent
I heard people sayin' that dude is stronger than he looks.
He's a loner. His clothes are kinda old, but he's cool.

Languid Delinquent
But man... Why would some Gekkou candy asses come here?
Students should stay at home and do their homework or whatever.

Languid Delinquent
I couldn't give a crap about 'em.
Long as they don't start any shit, they're cool with me.

Languid Delinquent
The whole reason I hang out here is to shoot the shit with my buds.
Those three weirdos are the only ones who come here to try to learn stuff.
They need to get a life...

Languid Delinquent
I thought that guy was a total loner... But he knows those weirdos?
Eh, like it matters.
I don't give two shits 'bout who's friends with who.

Languid Delinquent
Those assholes are just using us to gather info.
They think we're some handy-dandy tool that'll give 'em the scoop any time they ask.
There's somethin' wrong with those guys.

Languid Delinquent
Hmm...
I can't even imagine what they do with themselves all day. Can you?
Especially that long-haired freak. I think he, like, doesn't need anything but air to survive.

Languid Delinquent
Even though there's just two of 'em now, they're still nuts.
Especially that long-haired freak! Guy pisses me the hell off.

Languid Delinquent
I ain't crazy about goin' under the needle, man.
But you know how it is... I gotta have one, or else I'm chicken.
So what I did was I got this sticker that looks just like a tat.
You tell anyone and I'll beat your ass, got it?

Languid Delinquent
Yo, this had NOTHIN' to do with us. Got it? We weren't even here.
I know how it looks to guys like you on the outside...
But I don't give a shit about people if they just stay out of our faces.

Languid Delinquent
Huh... I wonder what's in that case of his.
He looks like the calmest dude out of the three of 'em. Don't ya think?
Maybe he's more normal than I'm givin' him credit for.
Yeah... There probably ain't anything to worry about in his case.

Languid Delinquent
What was up with those guys?
They come in, act like a buncha weirdos, and disappear.
I don't get it.

Languid Delinquent
Yeah, dude, it's all about self-confidence.
But we don't gotta worry about them anymore. They're long gone, dude.

Languid Delinquent
Yeah, I know what he means... You can't go anywhere these days without seeing those weird flyers.
What's up with that shit?
It doesn't look like any rival gang sign I know, but...

Languid Delinquent
Some guys like to plan this stuff in advance... I don't even own a calendar, man.
When we wanna do something, we do it. That's our holiday.
You gotta be free, dude.

Languid Delinquent
It's fine if they wanna say, "Those who believe will be saved." Whatever.
It bugs me, but at least I get what they're sayin'.
But that weird sign they leave all over the damn place is different. It doesn't make any sense.
Creeps me out... Shit...

Languid Delinquent
I saw that dude so often, I just thought of him as "that freak"...
But he's some kinda savior?
And he's got a whole cult behind him!?
Shit, dude... What the hell is everyone's problem?

Dude, do you remember anything we did this entire past year?
I just remember chilling here... That's it.
Man, I hate to say this, but... what a waste of time.

Mrs. Terauchi   
Anyway, you've been different lately, Ms. Toriumi.   
You're looking more and more like a professional!   
   
Mrs. Terauchi   
Your lesson the other day really caught my eye... It seemed like you spent a lot of time preparing it.   
I've never seen you so passionate about teaching before!   
It's unparalleled!   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Sad - Unparalleled...   
Well, yes, I have been studying while making preparations lately.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Things like, how to best communicate the lessons I'm looking to teach...   
Happy - I guess it does seem kind of out of the blue, huh?   
......   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
The thing is... I've decided to stop wasting my time only looking at what's right in front of me.   
   
Mrs. Terauchi   
How wonderful!   
I'm impressed by your change of heart. What brought this on?   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Well, when I was just goofing off one weekend... I met someone.   
After that, I took a closer look at my life.   
Sad - That person— Wait, they were real, right? They had to be.   
   
Mrs. Terauchi   
Ah yes, I understand. I myself once had a similar epiphany.   
Now that I think about it, I met my darling husband thanks to a destiny called fate...   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Surprised - A... destiny called fate?   
Sad - Isn't that a bit redundant?   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Happy - Besides, you should be careful what you say to a single woman... Hahaha...   
Anyway, if you'll excuse me...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The teachers seem busy...   
I should get out of the way.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Surprised - Oh! Arisato-kun...   
Is everything okay? Do you need something?   
Sad - You don't look well. Maybe you should go to the nurse's—   
   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Wait, you dropped something.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Surprised - Wha— Huh!? This phone wallpaper...!   
   
Mrs. Terauchi   
Now, now, mister Arisato... No cell phones at school.   
Hm? That screen...

Ms. Toriumi

Angry - Lalalalalalaaa! I can't hear you! I can't heeeeeear youuuuuu!

Surprised - Why do you have this screencap...?   
Sad - Ohhh, d-don't... Don't tell me you got it online! The only ones who were on that server were—   
   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Surprised - ......

Surprised - ............   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Surprised - Huh?   
Sad - No, it couldn't be...   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Sad - There's no way...   
Surprised - Are you kidding!?   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Embarrassed crying - No... No! NOOOOOO!   
   
Mrs. Terauchi   
C-Calm down, Ms. Toriumi! Help! Someone call a doctor!   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Surprised - Arisato-kun... Don't tell me... You're Tatsuya?   
Crying - I... I said all that... to you?   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Surprised - I... I-I...   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Surprised - Oh, no, no no no no no noooooooooo!   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Crying - Urghhh...   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Crying - Nooo... This can't be happening...   
Crying - I quit this school! I'm leaving! I'm never coming back!   
Embarrassed crying - I can't live with this! Just kill me now!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Please calm down...   
Hello, Maya-san.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Crying - Hnnngh...   
Crying - Ah...   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Surprised - Ack!   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Embarrassed crying - So... you really are—!   
Crying - Hnnngh...

Ms. Toriumi   
Angry - Um... I...   
Sad - I'm... Maya!   
Sad - I'm Maya...   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Embarrassed crying - It's me, dammit! You got a problem with that!?   
Crying - Why don't you say something!? Geez! You idiot!   
Embarrassed crying - This is so embarrassing!   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Sad - Ugh...   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
But...   
There was one thing I wanted to say... if we ever met face-to-face...   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
I...   
I was able to turn my life around thanks to you.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
So, um... thank you.   
Sad - Ngh...   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Angry - Wipe that smile off your face! Or I'll wipe it off for you—with my fists!   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Anyway, um... if you don't mind...   
If you don't... mind...   
Sad - Urgh...   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Sad - M... May... Maybe we could have dinner...?   
Sad - ......   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Angry - Oh, to hell with this!

President Tanaka
Happy - The other day, a woman came to my office asking for a donation.
Happy - Quite the looker, I might add. In fact, she was very much my type.
Sad - But no matter how attractive she was, I was repulsed by her dedication to charity work.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Are you going to donate?
You're not gonna donate?

President Tanaka
Happy - Of course not! I hate the very word!

President Tanaka
Angry - Ugh, if I say no, the tabloids are gonna tear me to shreds...

President Tanaka
Why should I have to give my hard-earned money to a bunch of freeloaders?
I pulled myself up out of squalor to get where I am today! I wanted to get back at the ones who used to laugh at me!

President Tanaka
Sad - ...That's what I always dreamed of, anyway. But to tell you the truth, now I have too much money.
Sad - Profits are booming, but I'm so busy I don't have time to spend a yen of it.

President Tanaka
Maybe I should train someone to take my place...
Happy - I could teach them my business philosophy and management techniques. They'd be a carbon copy of me!

President Tanaka
Happy - It would probably cost me a fortune... But if it works, then it's easy living! Hahahaha!

President Tanaka
Hmm... How would you feel about being adopted?
Happy - ...Only joking. People would get funny ideas if I took in a child as old as you!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
President Tanaka looks selfish
on the surface, but he seems
to care about me deep down.
I understand him a little better now...

President Tanaka
"Donate for the sake of the less fortunate," huh...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's getting late, so I'll go back to the dorm.

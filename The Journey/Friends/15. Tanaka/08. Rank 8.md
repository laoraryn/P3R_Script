President Tanaka
Happy - I'm used to being accosted by people, but recently I had an interesting encounter...
It was a young man not much older than you. Do you know what he said to me?
He said, "Thank you."

Minato Arisato - Selection
You must've misheard.
Why would he say that?

President Tanaka
I thought the same thing, so I asked him to repeat himself.
But sure enough, that's what he said. I was shocked someone would actually thank me for selling fake products.

President Tanaka
Happy - I'm not proud of this or anything, but I couldn't care less what our customers think.

President Tanaka
Happy - Don't you know who I am? I'm the president of a company that sells fake products!

President Tanaka
But then, he told me he quit his part-time job and was going to study to become a public prosecutor.
He wants to punish businessmen like me for bending the rules.
Sad - He said I was an example of a negative role model, even though I wasn't aware of it.

President Tanaka
Maybe I'm overreacting, but what if he does become a public prosecutor and puts me behind bars?
Sad - I suppose that means I wouldn't be able to give you my advice anymore...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
President Tanaka looks torn...
I understand him a little better now...

President Tanaka
...My shareholders oughta take a leaf out of that boy's book.
Sad - Apparently, kids these days aren't as naive as we thought...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's getting late, so I'll go back to the dorm.

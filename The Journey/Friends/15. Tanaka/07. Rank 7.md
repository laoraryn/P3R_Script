President Tanaka
Before I enlighten you today...
Happy - Well? Do you notice anything different about me?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Like what?
Sort of...

President Tanaka
Sad - Uh... Are you blind?

President Tanaka
Happy - I had an appointment at the spa for a facial peel... Isn't my skin simply radiant now?

President Tanaka
Happy - Ooh! So you can tell!?

President Tanaka
Happy - I had my hair revitalized! Doesn't it look healthier now?

President Tanaka
It's quite a hassle, but appearances are a big part of the job in my line of work.
That said, I'm the total opposite at home. I dress like a slob and only shower every three days.
Sad - Let me come up with an analogy... Hmm...

President Tanaka
Happy - ...Vegetables! Perfect!

President Tanaka
Imagine an organically grown cucumber that looks all deformed.
Compare that to a cucumber that looks perfect, but was grown using chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
Which one do you think the supermarket would rather stock?

Minato Arisato - Selection
The organic one.
The one that looks good.

President Tanaka
Happy - ...Wouldn't that be delightful?

President Tanaka
In an ideal world, they'd offer safe and delicious vegetables regardless of their appearance...
Happy - But in reality, supermarkets line their shelves with the prettiest cucumbers they can find.

President Tanaka
That's the simple truth...

President Tanaka
Awkwardly-shaped cucumbers don't pack together very well, so stores prefer straight ones.
Taste and safety aren't even a consideration. They'll carry cucumbers that even pests wouldn't eat.

President Tanaka
So, why do consumers still buy these cucumbers when they know the truth?
Simple. People trust what they see. The world is governed more by appearances than realities.
Angry - That's why, as much as I hate spending money, I buy expensive ties to win people's trust...

President Tanaka
Sad - Wait. You know what I just said earlier?
Sad - The part about me dressing like a slob and not showering every day?
Angry - Don't you dare tell ANYONE! I can't afford to have people start believing I'm ordinary!

President Tanaka
Sad - ...I only admitted it to you personally. No one else has a clue, okay?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
President Tanaka is opening up to me.
I understand him a little better now...

President Tanaka
Angry - Just a reminder: do not tell a soul. If you break your promise...
Happy - Well, I guess I can trust you. Run along, now...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After parting ways with President Tanaka,
I decided to return to the dorm.

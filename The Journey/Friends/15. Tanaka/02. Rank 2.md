President Tanaka   
Happy - My schedule is so terribly packed. I don't usually have time for your average Joe, you know.   
You should be glad you're such a handsome boy.   
   
President Tanaka   
Happy - All right, let's add a new word to our vocabulary today. Repeat after me!   
Happy - "Placebo"! The stress is on the middle syllable.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
"Placebo."   
......   
   
President Tanaka   
Happy - Very good! You're feigning interest well!   
   
President Tanaka   
Happy - Yes, I love that smoldering look in your eyes! You'll never succeed in life without skepticism!   
   
President Tanaka   
A placebo is a "pretend" pill. Basically, it's a medicine to give you peace of mind.   
   
President Tanaka   
Happy - Imagine this: A supplement to eliminate those unsightly love handles without lifting a finger!   
Happy - Or a car navigation system that uses real-time image data to make your commute all the smoother! Or at least make it feel that way.   
   
President Tanaka   
Happy - These are just a fraction of our unique line of products!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Wow.   
Can you even sell those?   
   
President Tanaka   
Huh? You're really wowed by those bogus products...?   
Sad - I suppose one could see them as rather spectacular...   
   
President Tanaka   
Happy - Well, of course I can. In fact, I sell them all the time!   
   
President Tanaka   
Our business doesn't provide tangible benefits. It provides peace of mind.   
   
President Tanaka   
Take emergency supplies, for example. People feel safe just because they have them, don't they?   
Happy - As it turns out, the more money people spend, the better they feel!   
   
President Tanaka   
Now then! That's it for today's lesson. You can pay me back when you make your first million.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I received somewhat questionable   
advice from President Tanaka...   
I understand him a little better now...

President Tanaka   
Have you been keeping your promise? You didn't tell anyone, did you?   
Angry - If you go back on your word, you might be surprised to find your profile suddenly on an Internet dating site!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It's getting late, so I'll go back to the dorm.

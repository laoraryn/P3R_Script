President Tanaka
I've decided to make a donation.
They're raising money to help orphans in foreign countries.

President Tanaka
Happy - Don't get the wrong idea! I'm not doing this out of the goodness of my heart. It's a long-term investment.
Happy - Children who learn to cope with adversity are more likely to become rich and famous, like me.

President Tanaka
I'm thinking of donating 10 million yen. Not a corporate donation, but a private one.
When I told them over the phone, they sent me this.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
President Tanaka handed
me a piece of paper.
It looks like a thank-you letter
from the charity group...

President Tanaka
Sad - I received it the very next day. Guess I can't back out now...

President Tanaka
10 million yen is nothing to me, though.
Happy - Once those children grow up and become successful, I'll introduce myself to them.
Happy - I'll say, "I'm the one who made all this possible!" Then I'll be well taken care of in my old age!

President Tanaka
If it wasn't for our conversations, I probably wouldn't have considered this.
Happy - By talking to you, I seem to have developed an interest in watching others mature...
Happy - I thank you for that. Actually, I should be thanking myself for so wisely taking note of this!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Beneath his selfish demeanor, I
can tell he really appreciates me.
I feel like I fully understand him now...

The Devil Social Link reached its maximum level! You can now fuse **Beelzebub**, the prince of demons!

President Tanaka
...You can keep that letter.
Sad - 10 million yen... I worked myself to the bone for that money, and all I have to show for it is that piece of paper.

President Tanaka
Happy - ...But it's not a bad feeling.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
DEV: Unused

President Tanaka
Angry - I'll be going now. The paparazzi could be anywhere!
Angry - If any one of them were to find out, my brilliant plan would be ruined!

President Tanaka
Oh, by the way. About that exclusive modeling contract...
I've decided to pass on that deal... Rather, it's your fault for sending me mixed messages.
Happy - Anyway, quit associating with shady middle-aged men like me and find what truly makes you happy.

President Tanaka
Happy - Bye forever!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's getting late, so I'll go back to the dorm.

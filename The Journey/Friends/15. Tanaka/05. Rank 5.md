President Tanaka
So, today we'll talk about—

Angry - Ugh, I just can't concentrate. I get so worked up when I picture his face!

Minato Arisato - Selection
What happened?
Whose face?

President Tanaka
Angry - He really did it! He betrayed me! I won't sleep a wink tonight!

President Tanaka
One of my employees. Maybe I should have seen it coming...

President Tanaka
There was a young man who was working for me... A hard worker who graduated from a distinguished private university.
But this month, he couldn't meet his sales quota, so I docked his pay. His self-confidence went down the drain.
Sad - Then... he just stopped coming to work.

Minato Arisato - Selection
I feel sorry for him.
What happened to him?

President Tanaka
Angry - What are you talking about!? You should feel sorry for me!

President Tanaka
He's probably cooped up in his home or something now. None of my business.

President Tanaka
Happy - I just mailed him a letter of termination, C.O.D.

President Tanaka
Angry - It's his fault the company's in the red this month! I've wasted so many resources!
Angry - All those expenses for training, hardware, facilities, labor costs...
Sad - It makes me sick just thinking about the net losses... Argh...

Minato Arisato - Selection
It's all about the money...
How bad is it?

President Tanaka
Angry - But of course it is! I love money.
Angry - Money won't betray me like he did.

President Tanaka
Well, he only worked for me for two years, so at least I won't have to provide a pension...
Angry - Ugh, I better not talk about it, or I'm going to pass out!

President Tanaka
Sad - It's difficult growing up with no money...
Sad - You can't even afford shoes for gym class, you know? Going barefoot in the winter is torture!

President Tanaka
I've been thinking... How would you like to model exclusively for my company?
Happy - Your innocent appearance would be a perfect camouflage for the ugly realities of business!

President Tanaka
Happy - Think about it, will ya? Join me, and you'll never have to worry about being shoeless in P.E.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
President Tanaka is
starting to open up to me.
I understand him a little better now...

President Tanaka
Oh, I'd better get going. We're short-staffed now, so I'll have to re-evaluate the budget for next month...
Sad - If I decide to hire someone new, their training is going to cost a fortune.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's getting late, so I'll go back to the dorm.

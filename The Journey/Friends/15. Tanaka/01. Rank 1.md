Man in a Suit
Happy - All right... If you insist, I'll give you my autograph. It's always a pleasure to meet a fan.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Who are you?
I don't want an autograph.
You look familiar...

Man in a Suit
Angry - ...Don't you have a television? Are you living in the stone age? How barbaric!

Man in a Suit
Angry - Oh, don't be ridiculous! Never look a gift horse in the mouth.

Man in a Suit
Sad - Oh my... It's so very difficult being famous. I can hardly go anywhere without being recognized.

Man in a Suit
Happy - I'm sure you've seen the home shopping program Tanaka's Amazing Commodities, yes?
Happy - Allow me to introduce myself.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The man handed me a business card...
It says, "Tanaka, President & CEO."

President Tanaka
Happy - That's right! I'm Tanaka himself. Surely you've heard the name.
Happy - I'm afraid I can't offer any returns on your 40,000 yen, but I've autographed my business card for you.
Happy - Hold onto that—it'll be worth a pretty penny in a year or so! And with that, I must be going.

President Tanaka
Angry - That little brat... Doesn't he realize he's in the presence of a star!?
Angry - Time is money—especially mine! I should've squeezed a few more payments out of him...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It sounds like he's talking about me...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Talk to him
Ignore him

President Tanaka
Angry - Huh!? Er— What do you want!? Quit disturbing me! Get out of here, shoo!

President Tanaka
Angry - ......

President Tanaka
Angry - Hey! Go away! You're making me nervous! Get out of here, shoo!

President Tanaka
Angry - You... You overheard me talking to myself just now, didn't you!?
Angry - You'll forget it ever happened if you know what's good for you. I belong to a powerful talent agency.
Angry - I'm practically a celebrity. I have an image to maintain!
Angry - Don't even think about telling someone that I took your money or called you a little brat! Capiche!?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Got it.
Whatever you say.

President Tanaka
Happy - ...Blind obedience has a price attached. Better learn that before it bites ya, kiddo.

President Tanaka
Angry - Don't get cute with me! You think you can get away with anything with that pretty face of yours!?

President Tanaka
Happy - Oh, silly me! I've let you in on my little secret, haven't I? Heh heh heh...
Happy - Don't... tell anyone, okay?
Happy - Please! I'll lick your shoes clean if you want me to!

Minato Arisato - Selection
All right.
I don't care.

President Tanaka
Er— Really? You promise? You better be ready to cross your heart and hope to die if you're lying to me!

President Tanaka
So... you won't tell anyone, right? You better be ready to cross your heart and hope to die if you're lying to me!

President Tanaka
Angry - A verbal agreement is a form of contract, and if you breach it I'll sue your pants off!
Happy - I've got your adorable little face etched into my memory.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
...He seems to have taken an interest in me.
I'm now acquainted with Tanaka, the
producer of a home shopping TV show...

President Tanaka
You're a diamond in the rough, my boy. All you need is a little polishing, and you'll sparkle.
Happy - I often take my breaks here. I'd be happy to mold your young mind whenever you wish.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After parting ways with President Tanaka,
I decided to return to the dorm.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I parted ways with President Tanaka.
I should show Elizabeth this autograph
when I have the chance...
For now, I'll return to the dorm.

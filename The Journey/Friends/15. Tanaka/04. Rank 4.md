Happy - Today's lesson is called, "The smaller the dog, the louder the bark!"
Happy - Have you ever wondered what it would be like to see through people's bathing suits at the beach?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure have!
Is that possible?

President Tanaka
My, I don't think I've ever seen you this enthusiastic.
Happy - Consumers might be persuaded by such candor. We could position you as the "boy next door"...

President Tanaka
Oops... I forgot. You're underage, aren't you?

President Tanaka
If you're curious, go ask one of your friends. Just... not a girl, unless you want to get slapped.

Our company ran an ad in, uh... adult magazines proposing a special filter for digital cameras.
Simply attach it to your camera, and voila! Start peeping! "Undress them with your camera's eye," it says.

President Tanaka
Happy - It's been selling like hotcakes! In fact, it's our number one seller!

President Tanaka
Unfortunately, customers have been complaining that it doesn't work...
I told my staff to just ignore them. Nowhere does it guarantee that you'll be able to see anything.
Happy - What are they gonna do? Tell everyone their creepy plan didn't work out? Sorry, bucko!

President Tanaka
By the way, try to cut back on the donuts and cupcakes. I have an idea for an ad campaign...
Happy - Women would go crazy over a handsome young man in swim trunks! You'd be perfect for the job!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
President Tanaka seems to trust me.
I understand him a little better now...

President Tanaka
Have you been keeping your promise? You didn't tell anyone, did you?
Angry - If you go back on your word, I'll edit your face into the most obscene material I can find!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's getting late, so I'll go back to the dorm.

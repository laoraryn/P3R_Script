Gekkoukan High School... A place of learning.   
It's quite a shock that such a warm, illustrious institution transforms into Tartarus every night.   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - Oh dear... What a conundrum.   
Everyone here seems to have a predetermined form of attire... I fear I may draw too much attention.   
I hope this won't pose a problem...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Don't worry.   
What will you do?   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - Understood. I shall heed your advice.   
Now then, excuse me as I make myself less conspicuous...   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - Please excuse me as I make myself less conspicuous...   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - ......   
If I stay hidden from view this way, then there won't be a problem, correct?   
   
Elizabeth   
Now then, the school awaits!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - This is... a pleasant surprise.   
To think there would be a bastion of commerce within a house of academia...   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - Could you please wait here for a moment? There's something I've been curious about for a while...   
   
Elizabeth   
Excuse me, I would like to purchase a "school lunch."   
   
School Store Vendor   
Um... Sorry?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
They don't sell that here.   
They only sell bread.   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - They don't deal in school lunches here...? How disappointing.   
I would have liked a taste of this "school lunch," as it is a rare delicacy only served in select facilities...   
Well, in that case, I shall order some bread. I've heard that having bread for lunch is part of the school experience.   
   
Elizabeth   
Sad - I would have liked a taste of this "school lunch," as it is a rare delicacy only served in select facilities...   
But I've heard that having bread for lunch is also part of the school experience.   
That will be a fine substitute.   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - Now that I've checked that off the list, let us proceed.   
As for where I'd like to go next... Shall we visit your homeroom?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - So this is a classroom...   
With so many students and desks, it's no wonder there's hardly any space between them...   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - But perhaps... Ah, I see. It's designed this way to foster a sense of harmony between classmates.   
Happy - I can sense the care put into this arrangement.   
   
Elizabeth   
This observation post must be what they call a "podium."   
Hm, interesting... When I stand here, I do feel a longing to teach well up inside of me.   
......   
   
Elizabeth   
Angry - First question!   
   
Elizabeth   
Between Diet Food and Super Diet Food... which is more delicious?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Diet Food   
Super Diet Food   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - That is incorrect.   
As a penalty for giving the wrong answer, you shall receive your own portion of Diet Food.

Elizabeth   
Surprised - That is correct!   
As a reward for giving the correct answer, you shall receive your own portion of Super Diet Food.

Elizabeth   
Is this what a classroom lecture is like?   
...The quizzical stares are beginning to make me feel unsettled. Let us carry on with the tour.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - This humanoid figure...   
Surprised - Did they seal him inside the plaster to prevent him from escaping?   
I imagine it would be quite cramped in there...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Elizabeth   
Truth be told, I do have some experience playing the piano.   
Are you familiar with The Velvet Song?   
   
Elizabeth   
Veeelvet, oh veeelvet~   
My master has a looong nooose! ♪   
   
   
Elizabeth   
All together now!

Haaah!

I walked around the school with Elizabeth.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Elizabeth   
Experiencing student life for myself today has broadened my perspective of your world.   
I'd very much appreciate it if you could accompany me again sometime.   
......   
   
Elizabeth   
Sad - To be honest... I don't entirely understand my own motives for coming here.   
Sad - But as I walked closely with you, I... How should I express this...?   
   
Elizabeth   
...I felt very fulfilled.   
Perhaps... what I really wanted to learn at school was more about you.   
   
Elizabeth   
Sad - But why...?   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - In any case, discovering the reason for this desire will surely serve as an intriguing diversion.   
Let us return now. Thank you, once again, for acting as my guide.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I returned to the Velvet Room with Elizabeth.

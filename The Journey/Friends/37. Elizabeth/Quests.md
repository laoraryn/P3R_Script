Phone Call - You need only seek the door.
Phone Call - Well then... I shall be anxiously awaiting your arrival.

Internal MES - MND_002_0_0
Elizabeth is waiting for
me at the Velvet Room.
I wonder what she wants to talk about...
I guess I should head to Paulownia Mall.

===============================================================================================

Elizabeth
I apologize for asking you to come at such short notice.

Elizabeth
Truth be told... I'd like to ask you a favor.
Happy - I've been searching for someone of exceptional ability.

Elizabeth
So if you have the time, do you mind taking on several of my requests?
On special occasions, I may require you to escort me on certain excursions.

Elizabeth
Happy - Of course, you will be aptly rewarded for completing the request.
I look forward to your cooperation and hope to see you demonstrate your capability.

Internal MES - MND_004_0_0

Bring the .

Elizabeth
It seems you have finally obtained the .
This concludes my request for you to gather all of the old documents.
I wanted you to learn the truth from the eight documents you've collected...
However, you are already moving towards another truth.
Although memories may remind you of the past, always walk toward the future...
Happy - I must admit... I'm a bit envious, since I have neither.

--------

Retrieve the progress report.
Please bring me the  from the top floor of Harabah, the fifth block in Tartarus. This document lies even higher up, waiting to be discovered... I'd love to see it for myself.
Bring the .

Elizabeth
It looks like you have obtained the .
This one seems somewhat different from the old documents you've collected.
It appears to be a report of an experiment, but it's unfinished—as if the author had been interrupted.
I can't quite comprehend the subject matter, but perhaps you can make some sense out of it.

--------

Traverse the Monad Passage.
Please investigate a certain passage in Yabbashah, the third block, on the 91st floor. Though the entrance appears the same as a Monad door, the inside seems to differ.
Defeat all the Shadows lurking within the Monad Passage on the 91st floor in Yabbashah, the third block.

Elizabeth
Happy - Well done on fulfilling my request.
The **Monad Passage** you explored seems to be slightly different from the usual "doors" you've encountered.
While they may both house strong Shadows...
The passage seems to lead deeper into the depths, thus harboring even more powerful Shadows.
But the rewards you reap are far greater.
By defeating all the Shadows within the passage, you will gain a new Major Arcana...
Which, in turn, will aid your growth.
I won't force you to undertake this task, but I do hope you continue to challenge these passages whenever you can.
Those of us who reside in the Velvet Room are always pleased to bear witness to your growth.
That will also bring me one step closer to fulfilling my true desire...
Surprised - ...Oh, my apologies. I didn't intend to take up so much of your time babbling.

--------

Defeat the Shadow of the Void.
I sense a presence of immense malevolence... Please defeat the Shadow of the Void lurking within the Monad Passage in the sixth block, Adamah.
Defeat the Shadow of the Void lurking within the Monad Passage on the 255th floor in Adamah, the sixth block.

Elizabeth
At the upper levels of Tartarus—deep, deep within—I sense an immensely malevolent presence...
This wicked shade prowling within the darkness... Let us call it the **Shadow of the Void**.
This time, I would like to request that you defeat this "Shadow of the Void."
While it is a request of considerable difficulty, I shall wait for a report of your success.

Elizabeth
Well done on vanquishing the Shadow of the Void.
That was one of the vilest creatures lurking in the shadows of Tartarus.
I'm very impressed that you managed to defeat it. Truly.

--------

------

Bring me a Muscle Drink.
Have you ever tried something called a "Muscle Drink"? I have long pondered its taste. Could you please bring me one to satiate my curiosity? I believe you may be able to purchase it somewhere.
Bring Elizabeth  .

Elizabeth
Let us start with a simple request.
Please bring me this beverage you call "."
It is not a particularly rare commodity, so you should be able to find and purchase it with ease.

Elizabeth
Oh, is that perhaps...?
A ... Though it looks delicious, it seems toxic at the same time.
Thank you for bringing me this. I will slowly savor each sip later on.

------

Bring me a giant, creepy doll.
I heard there's a "creepy-looking" doll in your world that is also used for educational purposes. I would like to see it for myself.
Bring a doll that is also used for teaching.

Elizabeth
I have heard whispers of a certain doll...
One with an appearance so horrific, it invokes nightmares.
But, on the other hand, it may also be used as a tool for education.
Perhaps one exists somewhere within the learning facility you attend... Would you mind searching for it?

Elizabeth
Oh? Is this the doll so feared by humans?
I see... So it's called an . The amount of detail is quite impressive.
But what makes it so terrifying? I find it rather cute. Just look at the way its round eyes stare into your soul.
Thank you for this lovely doll. I will find an ideal place to display this.

--------

I'd like to try all kinds of drinks.
I heard that there exists a contraption called a "vending machine" that automatically dispenses a variety of beverages. Could you please collect these aforementioned beverages and deliver them to me?
Collect 12 different drinks from vending machines for Elizabeth.

Elizabeth
I understand that there exists a machine in your world that automatically dispenses all kinds of beverages.
What a strange contraption, is it not? Though I must admit I have a peculiar interest in these beverages...
Could you gather some for me? Of course, whatever you can get your hands on shall suffice.

-------

I'd like to try aojiru.
Have you heard of a drink called "aojiru"? Rumor says it is "super gross." I prefer my drinks tasty and flavorful though. Therefore... would you please bring me a delicious aojiru?
Bring  .

Elizabeth
Word has it that the ultimate drink in your world is something called "aojiru."
However, the taste is described as "super gross." How intriguing, indeed...
After all, if I am to drink something, I would like for it to taste good... Therein lies my request.
Would you please look for a delicious aojiru for me?

Elizabeth
Surprised - Ah, so this is aojiru... It's an awfully dreadful shade of green, isn't it? Well, I'll just take a sip first...

Elizabeth
Happy - I see. The mellow sweetness that washes over your tongue, the citrusy aroma that permeates your nasal cavity...
It is, frankly speaking, quite delectable—though it's rather disappointing there's not much of it to last.

-------

Bring me some potent medicine.
I've heard that a powerful medicine is being produced in an ominous research facility known as the "nurse's office." Could you please get your hands on that medicine for me?
Bring  .

Elizabeth
I hear there exists a research lab called the "nurse's office" within the learning facility you attend.
Experiments, ranging from the scientific to the supernatural, are conducted there all day and night for the sake of humanity's health.
Apparently, aside from ordinary medicine, potentially lethal ones are also created there...
That said... I would like you to negotiate with the master of the nurse's office and bring me that potent medicine.

Elizabeth
Angry - I see, so this is the infamous medicine... Let me have a taste—right now.

Elizabeth
Surprised - Oh my... What an electrifying sensation. Potent, indeed. However, its well-balanced components prevent it from being truly lethal.
The master of the nurse's office must be incredibly skilled...

-------

Let me hear music unique to Gekkoukan.
I'd very much love to listen to a song that is associated with your school. Perhaps it would be wise to check a location within the school that broadcasts music...
Bring a CD associated with Gekkoukan High School.

Elizabeth
It's said that music can paint a vivid reflection of the culture at that time and place in history.
Should that prove true, then I wonder if the Gekkoukan High School you attend has its own unique music as well...
It's been on my mind ever since I've first heard of this... So will you do me one favor?
I'd like to hear a piece of music distinctive to your learning facility, Gekkoukan High School.

Elizabeth
Surprised - What is this circular disc? "Gekkoukan Boogie" is written on one surface...
Surprised - Is there music stored inside of it? Then, this sheet of paper must be the lyrics.
"Everybody was haiku writing"... "Those kids were fast as lightning."
Hm... I can't imagine what it sounds like from the words alone. I'll have to listen to it later.

------

I'd like to try a beef bowl.
A dish called the "Umiushi Beef Bowl" is allegedly all the rage in town now. If it truly is as exquisite as the rumors suggest, then I would love to have a taste myself.
Bring  .

Elizabeth
I hear that this "" is, as you humans say, all the rage in town.
Rumor has it that only enthusiastic freaks are permitted to consume this beef bowl...
So if possible, could you get your hands on a portion for me as well?

Elizabeth
So this is the famous ... The aroma truly whets the appetite.
Now then... Bon appétit.

Elizabeth
Surprised - My, how delicious! Something this delectable must have cost a fortune.
...It didn't? Then I must applaud this corporation's efforts to sell such quality food for cheap.

--------

Please prevail in the Big Eater Challenge.
The Big Eater Challenge, a unique event in which one must devour more food than the other contestants... Such a battle shall be held at the burger establishment at the Iwatodai strip mall. Would you please participate in my stead?
Complete the Big Eater Challenge at Wilduck Burger.

Elizabeth
Evidently, those who proclaim to be "big eaters" pit themselves against one another in fierce battles.
One such battle shall be held at the burger establishment at the Iwatodai strip mall...
As much as I'd like to participate in it myself, I fear I cannot leave my post here for too long...
Would you take on this "Big Eater Challenge" in my stead?

Elizabeth
I see that you took on the burger establishment's eating challenge.
I wasn't aware that completing it would grant you access to an off-menu combo...
Happy - What a truly generous service.
...Though it has only made me yearn even more to challenge it myself one day.

--------

I'd like to be gifted a bouquet of flowers.
I hear there is a custom in your world where a woman may receive roses. I would love to experience this myself. Would you please bring me some roses?
Bring  .

Elizabeth
I hear that there is a custom in your world in which a bouquet of flowers is given to a woman.
I, too, would like to receive such a gift... A bouquet of flowers.
Therefore, I request that you bring me roses of the deepest crimson. They would stand out brilliantly in our ultramarine-colored world.
I shall be awaiting the loveliest bouquet of roses from you.

Elizabeth
Surprised - Oh my. Is this... the bouquet of roses I asked for?
Happy - They're gorgeous. Thank you for this lovely gift. Truly.
I've heard that, in the language of flowers, the meaning of a bouquet depends on how many stalks there are.
Happy - So this bouquet means... Hehe, I'll look more into the matter later.

--------

Experiment with fortune telling.
I hear there is a fortune-teller at the club in Paulownia Mall. Could you verify the accuracy of her readings? One such fortune promises higher chances of encountering rare Shadows.
Make use of the Rarity Fortune that increases the appearances of rare Shadows.

Elizabeth
Have you ever had your fortune told, Minato?
It seems you can find a famous fortune-teller in the club at Paulownia Mall.
Rumor says for every question you ask, you shall receive an answer that is "right on the money."
I am greatly interested in the accuracy of this fortune telling.
Would you please use this person's services so that I may verify the authenticity of them?
Please ask them to predict **whether or not rare Shadows will appear more often**.

Elizabeth
How was the outcome of the fortune telling?
I see... So the predictions really did come true.
Just who in the world is that fortune-teller...? I hope to meet them someday...

--------

I'd like to see a pair of Max Safety Shoes.
In the online shopping world, these "Max Safety Shoes" appear to be extremely popular as of late. I wonder what makes them so "Max"... As my curiosity is killing me, I'd love to take a look at them.
Bring  pair of .

Elizabeth
The other day, I overheard a housewife say something rather intriguing.
Within the world of online shopping, these  are extremely popular right now.
I would love to see what makes these shoes so special... Would you please bring me a pair?

Elizabeth
So these are the sought-after ...
Sad - They seem like an ordinary pair of shoes...
Sad - Perhaps their intended purpose will only reveal itself in a crisis...
In that case, I'll be returning these. I'm sure they shall prove more useful to you.

Elizabeth
Did you obtain the  I asked for?
Surprised - Oh? You do not have them on you right now...

I explained to Elizabeth that
Aragaki had worn them...

Elizabeth
Sad - ...I see. In that case, there's nothing that can be done.
But, as it seems you had obtained them, let us consider this request fulfilled.

--------

Bring me the mysterious person's autograph.
I hear a certain individual from the online shopping world often appears in your world as well. It seems he has quite the distinctive personality. Would you please meet this person and get me his autograph?
Get an autograph from President Tanaka of Tanaka's Amazing Commodities.

Elizabeth
Do you recall the online shopping world I spoke of in an earlier request?
That seems to be related to a strange individual who often rambles along to a unique melody.
Furthermore, he appears to be quite the prominent figure in your world...
I've also heard that such prominent figures have a habit of handing out autographs on the streets.
Since I am unable to leave my post... would you mind fetching me their autograph?

Elizabeth
Hm? It says here... "Tanaka's Amazing Commodities"?
Ah, it must be that prominent figure's autograph. I must say, he has very beautiful penmanship.
He must be as powerful as the rumors say... This man who rambles along to a unique melody.
Happy - Oh, I see that you've acquired a new bond in addition to the autograph. That is very good news indeed.

--------

I want to eat a chilled taiyaki.
I heard that your world has a strange "taiyaki" that is cold despite having been grilled. It must be filled with flavors that are simply out of this world... I'd love to have a taste myself.
Bring  .

Elizabeth
I believe there is a sweet, grilled fish called "taiyaki" that is often consumed in your world...
Apparently, there is also a strange taiyaki that is cold even though it has been grilled.
I, for one, would love to have a taste. Could you please bring me one?

Elizabeth
So this is the ... Well, it certainly is cold.
Happy - It has a soft, chewy texture and such cute, round eyes... I shall savor every bite.

--------

I'd like to try a home-cooked meal.
I wonder what a "home-cooked meal" tastes like... You may bring either food or beverage—I've no preference.
Bring a food or drink you made together with someone at the dorm.

Elizabeth
Allegedly, something called a "home-cooked meal," which possesses a special kind of flavor, exists in your world.
I'm curious what it tastes like... Very much so.
Could you bring me something with the flavor of this "home-cooked meal"?
It can be either food or beverage—I've no preference. Well then, I'll be looking forward to it.

--------

I'd like to see a mysterious potato.
There's a rumor that claims a potato raised with love and care will develop a mysterious power... Could you verify if such a potato can really be grown?
Bring a potato that you've grown.

Elizabeth
By the way, I heard a rumor that a potato grown with painstaking love and care will develop a mysterious power.
I believe you can obtain the proper seeds to grow such potatoes from a shop that deals in plants.
Would you please grow and nurture a potato to verify the authenticity of these claims?

--------

Attempt a hundred shrine visits.
There is a ritual called "a hundred shrine visits" that supposedly grants wishes... I would love to witness the miracle of the gods myself. My wish is for a 500-yen bill.
Bring what you receive from praying at the shrine.

Elizabeth
Are you aware of a ritual called the "hundred shrine visits" that supposedly grants wishes?
I would love to witness the miracle of the gods myself. However, I cannot abandon my duties here...
So would you please visit the shrine on my behalf?
As for my wish... 500-yen bills are extremely rare in your world, yes? Then I'd like to wish for one.

Elizabeth
Oh? What's this? I sense a strange power emanating from that bill...
I thought it would've taken months and years to complete the "hundred shrine visits."
But perhaps it is not the number of visits that matters, but the strength of your wish.

--------

Look for the drink with my name.
According to rumors, the beverage bearing the same name as me is only available in an unpopular location. Please search for it and bring it to me.
Bring a drink that shares a name with Elizabeth.

Elizabeth
Angry - I've come across a rumor I cannot dismiss.
Angry - Apparently, my name is being used somewhere without my knowledge or consent.
According to the rumor, this beverage is only available in an unpopular spot.
Please conduct a thorough investigation of this beverage, as it concerns my reputation.

Elizabeth
I see... So this is the beverage that bears my name.
It does indeed say "Elizabeth" on the label, and there is a very lovely, very rich aroma.
If I am to be honest... it does make me feel a little prideful. I'll take some time to enjoy it later.

--------

I'd like to see proof of a bond.
A bond is normally invisible to the naked eye. However, it is sometimes shown through the act of gift-giving... Would you please show me an item that represents a strong bond you share with someone?
Bring an item you can only receive when a Social Link has been maxed out.

Elizabeth
According to my master... the stronger your bonds, the greater your power.
Though a strong bond is no tangible object... I understand that one can sometimes be represented by a gift.
Would you please show me an item symbolic of a strong bond?

Elizabeth
So this is proof of one of your bonds...
Though it's made out of ordinary material, I can sense... some sort of warmth from it.
Happy - You have nurtured a beautiful bond... A precious, irreplaceable bond.

Elizabeth
Though it has no physical manifestation, I can feel a bond forming between you and me as well...

Please bring me a stylish item that would look good on me. I believe you may find something where the young and trendy gather to have a good time...

Therefore, I'd like to try my hand at dressing up as well.
If you don't mind terribly, could you please bring me a fashion item that would suit me?
I believe you could find something in a place where people often gather to mingle... I'll be looking forward to it.

Elizabeth
Hm... While these glasses have a simple design, they do somehow feel sophisticated.
I must say, I have taken a strong liking to them. Now, to put them on...

Elizabeth
Behold, the new me! Yaaay!
Ahem... My apologies. These glasses just suit me so well, I couldn't help but get a little carried away.
Happy - The moment I slipped them on, I felt my spirits lift. Glasses are truly a gem that complete a person's style.
It makes me want to wear them all the time. Thank you for bringing me a pair.

Bring a tile with a peacock design.

Elizabeth
There's something I'd like you to bring me...
It's a small piece with an intricate design of a peacock.
This piece seems to bring people either unbridled joy or sorrow... and can sometimes be a matter of life or death.
What would it feel like to have such a piece in my hands...? I'd love to find out.

Elizabeth
Oh? Is that not the item I had been seeking all this time?
What a beautifully painted peacock... Ah, so this is called a ?
Surprised - It's used in a game, you say? I wonder if it is as essential as a card is in a card game...
At any rate, thank you for this piece. I will cherish it.

Bring something you find from the ocean.

Elizabeth
I have longed to visit this place called the "ocean"...
Alas, as you know, I am unable to abandon my post here.
So if you ever have the opportunity to visit the ocean...
Would you look for something that feels like the ocean for me?

Elizabeth
Oh, I see you're carrying something related to the ocean...
May I have one?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Pretty Seashell
Strange Seaweed
Yakushima Wood
Small Crab

Elizabeth
My, my... What a beautiful shell.
Happy - I profess, it is deeply moving knowing that something so enchanting was sculpted by nature...

Elizabeth
Is this what you call seaweed?
Perhaps it will be edible once cooked by fire. I am very pleased to have received this.

Elizabeth
Is this... driftwood? It's rough around the edges, but there's something beautiful about it.
The power it exudes must have come from its long journey across the open sea.

Elizabeth
Surprised - Oh, is this tiny creature a crab? How adorable...
Snip, click, snip, click... Their movements are so unique.
I must give it a truly magnificent name. You may rest assured I will nurture it with great care.

Elizabeth
Thank you. Because of your stories—and your lovely souvenirs—I was able to experience the ocean myself.

Happy - Not only does it give me a semblance of intelligence, but also one of harmony as well... What a splendid item.

--------

Bring me my Christmas present.
It appears that Santa has been so busy with Christmas this year that he forgot to deliver my present... Would you please find Santa and bring me my present?
Get Elizabeth's Christmas present from Santa.

Elizabeth
Christmas has brought good cheer to everyone recently. I hear you may even receive a present during this period.
A figure called "Santa" supposedly flies all over the world, giving gifts to those considered "nice."
However, I have yet to receive mine. I believe he must have forgotten it... Or worse, misplaced it.
...May I trouble you to pick up my present from this "Santa"?

Elizabeth
Ah, so you have finally brought my Christmas present...
Then, without further ado...

Elizabeth - MND_REQ_REWARDINFO_034_2
Elizabeth took not the present,
but the Santa hat... and put it on.

Elizabeth
Surprised - I see... One must first become Santa before partaking in Christmas.
I suppose that experience itself is the most valuable gift of all, is it not?

Minato Arisato - Selection
No, not really.
I brought an actual gift.

Elizabeth
Surprised - ...Oh, is that so? My apologies.
However, I have taken quite a liking to this hat, so you may have the present.

I would like one— No, correction: three of those dolls, please.

Elizabeth
That physical manifestation of Jack Frost... Yes, no doubt, it is a !
I am greatly fond of Jack Frost. May I... touch it?
Happy - Oh my... So soft...
To be honest, I was conflicted over what sort of Jack Frost request to make...
I also considered asking you to nurture him until he reaches level 99, but...
Happy - I'm glad I chose to make this request in the end since I've gotten such a cute doll out of it.
That said, I would still love to see Jack Frost at his strongest one day.

Elizabeth
Ever since the time we went around sampling your world's culinary delights, my interest in food has been piqued.
In my quest for more delicacies, I came across information about this "sushi."
I learned that it is eaten during festivities and often offered to the gods at their shrines.
This "sushi" must taste divine, especially if it is the gods' favorite food... I wish to have a bite myself.

Elizabeth
So this is "sushi"... It's made into such a tantalizing shape.
I see. This is called , a festive food enjoyed by the people...

Imagine fusing the two of them... Hehe, I'm sure something interesting will happen.

--------

Elizabeth
Looks like you managed to fuse **Alice** of the Death Arcana. Well done... That completes this request.

Now you're one step closer to mastering the art of fusion.
Happy - What spectacular progress you've made.

---------

Elizabeth
You have certainly nurtured **Loki** to the required level. Well done, that completes this request.
Now, as for your reward, I've gone ahead and prepared something special.
With it, you'll be able to fuse **Masakado** of the Tower Arcana.
Masakado is unbelievably strong, and you will need to be equally powerful to control him.
But I am confident you are up to the challenge.

----------

Fusion Series #10: Tower, Masakado
This shall be the final task for creating Personas. As you have managed to complete all fusion-related tasks thus far, I am confident you will succeed with this one as well.
Have a Masakado with the skill Charge in your possession and report to Elizabeth.

Elizabeth
...Well done. You have a **Masakado** that meets the requirements I specified.
That brings us to the end of my Persona-related requests.
I have asked you to fuse ten different Personas.
It may not have been easy, but the fact remains that you still managed to fulfill each and every one of my requests.
Happy - I hope that the many powers dwelling within your heart will aid you on your journey.

-------

Fusion Series #6: Strength, Siegfried
My intent in preparing this task is to help nurture your abilities. You will not receive any hints for this one. If you manage to obtain this Persona, then you will surely gain invaluable strength.
Have a Siegfried with the skill Endure in your possession and report to Elizabeth.

Elizabeth
I see that you have a **Siegfried** that meets the requirements I specified. That completes this request.
Now that you have acquired both Mithras and Siegfried...
You will finally be able to execute their special technique.
Do make good use of it in your battle against the Shadows.

----------

Bring me a Sengoku-era helm.
I would like to see something called a "helm," a protective covering for the head, one rich with history... I'm sure there exists a person who still cherishes one to this day.
Bring a helm from the Sengoku era.

Elizabeth
For this request, I would like for you to bring me a certain headgear.
More specifically, this headgear is a "helm" that has existed since ancient times.
Since this is an item rich with history, I expect that it will provide the wearer with quality defense...
I believe you may be acquainted with someone who cherishes one such helm deeply.

Elizabeth
I see... So this is it. The helm from the ancient Sengoku era...
The heft, the texture... The character for "love" on the brow...
Does that love... protect the head? Or is it love for the helm...?
Mysteries upon mysteries... Still, it is a wonderful helm. This satisfies my request.
Why don't you take the helm with you? I believe it suits you far better than it does me.

--------

I'd like to try Oden Juice.
I would like to get my hands on this legendary "Oden Juice." I advise that you first speak with an expert on beverages. My hunch tells me you may find one such person near a persimmon tree.
Bring some Oden Juice.

Elizabeth
Ah... About that request: I hear it is very difficult to obtain even one can of .
Even among canned drink fanatics, only a few have managed to get their hands on it...
As it would be unwise to conduct a search without any leads, I advise that you first speak with an expert.
This is merely a hunch, but perhaps you'll find one such person near a persimmon tree...

Elizabeth
Ah, so that's the legendary ... Though at first glance, it appears to be an ordinary can of juice.
Oh? It's warm...
Angry - This grainy mouthfeel... It must be one of the ingredients in oden.
It feels like... daikon? Or maybe an egg? How very mysterious...
I see technology advances at a rapid pace... I will wait until later to savor the taste of this juice.

--------

Bring me food for a furry friend.
Will you bring me the sort of food a furry friend on four legs would enjoy? You might be able to get some from that close friend of yours.
Bring the item Elizabeth is asking for.

Elizabeth
If you don't mind, I'd like you to bring me a certain food...
However, it is not something that is typically consumed by humans.
In fact, one of your friends seems to delight in eating it. The furry one with four legs? Did you know that?

Elizabeth
So this is the food enjoyed by your little furry friend...
Oh? The label says, "Luxury Dog Food." Is your friend something of a gourmet?
Surprised - What an enticing aroma... Don't tell me, they used that as an ingredient?
I truly envy your friend for being able to enjoy such luxurious meals...

--------

Go clean a restroom.
Would you please clean the restroom at the station in an attempt to beautify the city? The tools I have given you should be of use.
Bring the cleaning supplies and clean the restroom.

Elizabeth
The request this time is to clean up the city. The location shall be...
Port Island Station's restroom. Please help clean that area.
You have already been provided with the necessary cleaning tools, so please make good use of them.

Elizabeth
Thank you for your help cleaning the Port Island Station restroom.
The brush you used to clean the bathroom...
The filth that's now encrusted on the bristles might help in battle. A very primitive form of biological warfare...
Maybe this is a sort of weapon fusion... No?

--------

Go water the flowers.
When I visited Gekkoukan High School, the flowers in the flowerbed appeared to be wilting... Would you please water them?
Water the flowerbed at school.

Elizabeth
While we were taking a stroll around Gekkoukan High School together...
I noticed the flowers in the rooftop garden were on the verge of dying. Perhaps because not many people frequent that area?
What a sad sight for such a lovely spot...
Would you be so kind as to give those flowers some water?

Elizabeth
Thank you for watering the flowers that were on the verge of withering.
I have heard that plants grow so long as one continues to water them.
Admirable, isn't it? But plants aren't the only ones capable of such a thing.
Maybe I'll try this watering process on myself as well. There's a part of me I'd like to cultivate...
The next time you see me, maybe I'll have grown a little in some way.

--------

Please feed the cat.
Somewhere in the city, there appears to be a hungry cat who is having trouble finding food. Would you please find and feed the poor thing?
Give the hungry cat some food.

Elizabeth
...I sense a presence.
There seems to be a hungry cat somewhere out there.
It appears to have trouble finding food. As such, it has not yet been fed... Would you please find and feed the poor thing?

Elizabeth
I see you have successfully fed the hungry cat.
Thank you. I can feel relief in the very cockles of my heart.
I hope it prospers forever and ever...

--------

Bring me a Featherman R action figure.
Please bring me a Featherman R action figure. Again, it has to be a Featherman R action figure and no other Featherman.
Bring the item that Elizabeth is asking for.

Elizabeth
This time, would you bring me a Featherman R action figure?
Surely you know the catchphrase? "Evil be gone! The Phoenix Ranger of love and justice is here!"
And, allow me to clarify, I am only asking for a Featherman R action figure.
Keep in mind: no other Featherman will do. Not for this request.

Elizabeth
I see you have obtained a Featherman R action figure... May I hold it?
Interesting... You can put it in various poses and play with it.
Surprised - Oh... It's flexible enough to be put in this kind of pose? Um...
...This may be a bit overwhelming for me, emotionally speaking. You may have this back.

--------

I'd like to walk around Paulownia Mall.
I've developed a yearning to explore your world. Would you please escort me around Paulownia Mall during the daytime?
Show Elizabeth around Paulownia Mall.

Elizabeth
Thank you for showing me around Paulownia Mall.
Regarding that fountain... I still haven't decided what to wish for.
Sad - Unfortunately, my master has vetoed my wish to renovate the Velvet Room with a dance floor.
Sad - I was so set on establishing Club Velvet that coming up with another wish has proved to be rather... difficult.
Surprised - ...Oh.
I'll wish to come up with a wish. There... That settles it.

--------

I'd like to visit Iwatodai Station.
My yearning to explore your world has grown even stronger. Please escort me around Iwatodai during the daytime.
Walk around Iwatodai with Elizabeth.

Elizabeth
Thank you for showing me around Iwatodai Station.
The fascinating rides, the dangerous traps... and, of course, the cornucopia of curious cuisine.
The way people went about their lives there was quite different from those we saw previously at Paulownia Mall.
So that I might not forget what we saw, I'd like to re-create some of the dishes we sampled.
First, I must hunt for ingredients... Hehe, this will be so much fun!

---------

I'd like to visit Naganaki Shrine.
My yearning to explore your world grows ever stronger still... I would like you to escort me around Naganaki Shrine during the daytime.
Walk around Naganaki Shrine with Elizabeth.

Elizabeth
Thank you for showing me around Naganaki Shrine.
Happy - I must say that the harmony between religion and recreation was indeed superb.
I am currently in negotiations with my master about introducing a set of horizontal bars in our room.
If I should win his favor, please stop by to make use of them.

---------
I'd like to visit Gekkoukan High.
I can no longer suppress my desire to explore your world. Would you escort me around Gekkoukan High School after its hours of operation?
Show Elizabeth around Gekkoukan High.

Elizabeth
Thank you for showing me around Gekkoukan High School.
I am slowly coming to understand why being there lifted my spirits...
Gekkoukan isn't just a part of your world... It's a place where you spend a great deal of time on a daily basis...
It is a place saturated with your presence.
Sad - That's why I...
Happy - ......
...I will set that aside for now. There's more that I need to consider.

--------
I'd like to visit your room.
My desire to explore your world cannot possibly be abated. Please accompany me to your room during the daytime.
Invite Elizabeth to your room.

Elizabeth
Thank you so much for showing me your room.
To show my gratitude for indulging my curiosity to the end, I have something truly special for you.
With it, you'll be able to fuse **Lucifer** of the Judgement Arcana.
The lord of Hell, whom no mere human could dare reach—his power unparalleled.
However, someone of your caliber is plenty capable of rising to the challenge.
Sad - ......
Sad - ...I can but only gaze from below.
However, I...
I am willing to stay by your side, no matter what heights you reach.
I will overcome any ordeal that may stand in the way of my goal... That, I believe so.
This now concludes the last of my requests to explore your world.
Happy - Thank you very much for everything you've done for me...

--------
Bring me pine resin.
Bring me this "pine resin" that is used in archery. Rumor says it looks exactly like soybean powder. I have a feeling you may be able to get some from a close friend of yours.
Bring the item that Elizabeth is asking for.

Elizabeth
Truth be told, my love for soybean powder is rivaled by none.
I hear something called "pine resin" looks just like my beloved soybean powder.
I've also heard that it's used as a tool in archery. Do you know anything about it?

Elizabeth
Surprised - Oh? Is that soybean powder you have there?
Ah, no... It must be the pine resin I requested.
It really does resemble soybean powder...
It's so similar that even an expert on soybean powder such as myself can't tell the difference.
Now then, your reward for this request will be... soybean powder. Do enjoy.

Elizabeth
Surprised - ...Apologies. I was just using soybean powder to garnish a dish not too long ago, so...

--------

Bring me a handheld game console.
Could you bring me a tiny device known as a "handheld game console"? Perhaps you could acquire one from a close friend who enjoys using it.
Bring the item that Elizabeth is asking for.

Elizabeth
Do you know of a device called a "handheld game console"?
I would like you to bring me one.
Rumor says it's a very dangerous item... But there are also many who love it.
It is truly a mysterious device... Please be careful when handling it.

Elizabeth
Is that a handheld game console?
I've heard these have special mechanisms that make the player forget about the passage of time...
Angry - Though it doesn't seem to be particularly special at first glance.
Surprised - Perhaps this device shoots out some kind of ray when the power is turned on, and your memory get—

...Apologies, but I must pass this time. Thank you for bringing me one, but you can have it back.

--------

Bring me a triangular sword.
Bring me what is known as a "triangular sword." I hear this sword has a long history behind it... Perhaps you ought to ask a close friend about it, one who happens to be knowledgeable on such matters.
Bring the item that Elizabeth is asking for.

Elizabeth
For this request, I'll be changing it up and issuing it as a little quiz.
Please bring me a "triangular sword." Your hint: it was originally used for dueling.
...If you need help figuring it out, perhaps you ought to try asking one of your close friends.
Sometimes, it is most wise to ask others for assistance.

Elizabeth
Bingo! That is indeed what I requested—a fencing épée.
As I mentioned before, an épée was used to duel in ancient times.
Fencers would wear white uniforms so that the blood from struck blows would be more visible.
And now, a special quiz just for you. Do you know why my clothes are blue?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Because it suits you.
Because it's soothing.
No reason in particular.

Elizabeth - SEL_REQ_REWARDINFO_075_3
Happy - ......
...I will ask my master for the correct answer.

--------

Bring me protein not for pros.
I would like you to bring me some protein that not only pros can drink, but amateurs, too... I have a hunch that you may be able to acquire some from a very athletic friend.
Bring the item that Elizabeth is asking for.

Elizabeth
This time, I'd like you to bring me some protein.
But not just any protein—I'd like one that even amateurs would be able to consume.
Would you try looking for something like that? If such a thing even exists, of course.

Elizabeth
This must be the brand of protein specially designed for amateur athletes...
Angry - "Amateur-Pro Tein"? How can it be for both amateurs and pros?
Ah... The word "protein" doesn't have anything to do with "professionals." How very interesting.
Thank you very much. I am sure this must be quite valuable, so you may have it back.

--------

Bring me a glasses wipe.
Will you please bring me a "glasses wipe"? Based on its name alone, it is my understanding that anyone who wears glasses should be in possession of this item.
Bring the item that Elizabeth is asking for.

Elizabeth
Glasses... An object that makes you feel infinitely more intelligent when you don them.
There is even an item that helps maintain the pristine quality of the lenses. I believe it is called a "glasses wipe"?
While such an item is not necessary for those who do not wear glasses, it is essential for those who must.
I would love to get my hands on this "glasses wipe." Would you bring one to me?

Elizabeth
So this must be the sort of thing one would use to clean a pair of eyeglasses.
Fine microfibers, maximum flexibility and absorbency, and an ideal size... It's utterly perfect.
I see... It wasn't just any old rag, after all.
Hm...? You've brought something else with you? May I see that as well?

--------

Bring me a Christmas star.
Please bring me a "Christmas star." Perhaps a close friend well-versed in plants would know something about it...
Bring the item that Elizabeth is asking for.

Elizabeth
This time, I'd like for you to bring me a certain plant.
It is often referred to as the "Christmas star."
I do not have any more knowledge on this subject. Should you require help, I recommend asking someone well-versed in plants.

Elizabeth
That red-leafed plant... Is that the Christmas star?
Surprised - I was led to believe there would be presents growing from this plant.
This fulfills my request, but you can take it back with you.
Although once the presents are in bloom, I'd like for these plants to fill our room...

--------

Bring me a fruit knife.
Please bring me a blade that likes to cut through fruit, also known as a "fruit knife." Should there be someone close to you well-versed in the culinary arts, I suggest you ask them first.
Bring the item that Elizabeth is asking for.

Elizabeth
There exist many types of blades, each with their own uses.
Among these variations, I would like to study the one known as the "fruit knife."
The fact that it has "fruit" in the name must mean it possesses some kind of special ability that only works on fruit...
It is certainly a tool of great interest. Please, bring me one immediately.

Elizabeth
What a sharp, shining blade... That must be the fruit knife I asked for.
It seems as though it's been in use for a long time, but it's almost as sharp as the day it was made...
I bet it has been used to cut a wide variety of things, not just fruit.
It's an all-purpose cooking tool.
Surprised - Hm? There's something written on the handle. "Graduation"... "gift"... "orphanage"...
This item appears to be quite dear to someone, so be sure to take it back with you.

--------

Bring me oil.
Would you bring me some oil frequently used by one of your acquaintances?
Bring the item that Elizabeth is asking for.

Elizabeth
This time, I'd like you to fetch me some oil.
Since there is a vast selection of this item, it would undoubtedly be extremely difficult to collect every single variation.
Therefore, I only ask that you bring me the oil frequently used by one of your acquaintances.

Elizabeth
Ah, is that the oil I requested?
Surprised - "Silicone oil for precision components"? My, this seems to be the real deal...
I wonder what its intended use is... Should I apply it? Soak in it? Or perhaps, drink it...?
Well, in any case, this completes my request. As for the oil... you can take it back with you.

Open a total of 100 treasure chests.

Treasure Hunting Milestone #3

Yes, I am speaking of the **Reaper**... This time, my request is for you to defeat it.
No doubt, this is an extremely challenging request, and I do not intend to force it upon you.
But do consider undertaking it should you have confidence in your abilities.

Elizabeth
I see you've acquired a ...
Which means... you've managed to defeat the Reaper? That's quite a feat.
You are approaching the level of strength I hoped you'd achieve...
I have waited so very long, in this room where time has no meaning...
You may be the one to help me answer the question that has confounded me...
...Please excuse me. That completes this request.

--------

Take out the ultimate adversary.
We have made arrangements for you to battle with the ultimate adversary at the deepest point of Tartarus. Please take down your opponent—alone.
Defeat the ultimate adversary.

Elizabeth
None can deny your power, not after you defeated the Reaper in battle.
Thus, we have arranged a battle with an opponent befitting your caliber—the ultimate adversary, so to speak.
I believe you are familiar with "the depths," correct? At its end lies the deepest point of Tartarus.
Please head there to face this challenge—alone.

Elizabeth
Happy - Hehe... This request requires no confirmation, of course.
It was the last thing I'll ask of you.
Here is your reward—the gift of ultimate power...
No matter where you go or what you do...
I'm certain you will persevere and overcome every single obstacle in your way.
Happy - Thank you so much for indulging my curiosity.

Perform King and I.
Fusion Spell, a hidden power that belongs to you and only you... One of several is called "King and I." To execute this Fusion Spell, you'll need King Frost and the biggest, baddest boy of all Jack Frosts.
Carry out the "King and I" Fusion Spell.

Elizabeth
This request is meant to draw out more of your power... The power of the wild card.
In order to achieve that, you will need to perform a Special Fusion...
One involving the king of all Jack Frosts—**King Frost**—and his darling subordinates.
It is a rather daunting challenge, but I await your report of success.

Elizabeth
I see that you have successfully performed the "King and I" Fusion Spell.
Well done, that now completes this request.
The king of all Jack Frosts, together with the Jack Frost who has obtained sinister powers...
The mischief wrought by these two will surely be a great aid to you.

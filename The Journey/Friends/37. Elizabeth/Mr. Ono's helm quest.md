Mr. Ono
Yes, Arisato?
Did you have a question about my lecture— Hm? Yes? What are you staring at?

Mr. Ono
Is it my helm...? Could that be it?

Mr. Ono
Is this really happening? Boy, oh boy. That's one discerning eye you've got there, kid!
Isn't this helm great? It is, isn't it?
It's a historic masterpiece Masamune had since he was young...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mr. Ono keeps going on
and on with his story...

Mr. Ono
*sniffle* So Masamune gave this helm to his vassal before he departed...
Such generosity! It's as if he foresaw his fate...
*sob* *sob*

Mr. Ono
...And that's why I couldn't possibly part with it.
I could give you something else from my personal collection, though—one with no connections to Masamune.
If you still want one... Well, you do, right?
Come see me again, and I'll let you have it.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I enjoyed the tales of Masamune.
I have a deeper understanding of history...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
If I come back to speak with Mr. Ono
at the faculty office another day,
I might get my very own helm...

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mr. Ono seems to have stepped out...

Mr. Miyahara
Let's see, I averaged two hours of overtime... Now factor in the mean age...
Add a little spice here, here, and here...
According to my extrapolations of next year's salary here... I can expect a 4.17% increase.
...Huh? Wait a second, if I round up... then I actually get 5.17%!
Um...
Well, in any case, this is one beautiful equation...

Mr. Miyahara
Oh, hello there, Arisato-kun. Did you overhear my calculations?
Isn't my use of pi in that equation a daring move?
Sure, it may not have been strictly necessary, but it's a question of elegance!
Even Masamune himself would be impressed.
Oh, uh... Guess Mr. Ono's been rubbing off on me.

Mr. Miyahara
I assume you're here because you've discovered the beauty of math, right?
Once you master its brilliance, even winning the lottery is a breeze.
Just calculate the probability from all sides... And determine the precise collection totals, too.
Then if you calculate how much of your winnings you ought to save, you'll always make a profit!
Not that I've ever bought a ticket...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I listened to the secret behind
falling in love with math...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mr. Ono doesn't seem to be returning.
I decided to give up for today.

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mr. Ono seems to have stepped out...

Ms. Ounishi
The main ingredients are... d-glucose, erythritol, saccharin sodium...
These are all sweeteners...

Ms. Ounishi
Oh, Arisato.
Take a look at this.

Ms. Ounishi - MND_003_0_0

Ms. Ounishi
I ordered a bag of sand through the mail the other day, and it came with this supplement.
It says here that this will "boost your brain power." I don't know how they could make such an outlandish claim with these ingredients.
See for yourself. The active ingredients in this are all sweeteners.
At the very end, it lists an omega-3 fatty acid called DHA, but that means there's only trace amounts of it.
I know it was free, but what a joke. Maybe I'm in the wrong line of work...

Ms. Ounishi
Go ahead and take it if you want it, though the best it'll do is be a placebo.
The food they serve at Wakatsu has better benefits than that.
It's made with loads of fish eyes, a prime source of DHA!
It's not my thing, though.
Speaking of DHA, did you know the full term is docosahexaenoic acid? You see, it's...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I learned about DHA...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mr. Ono doesn't seem to be returning.
I decided to give up for today.

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mr. Ono seems to have stepped out...

Mr. Ekoda
Ugh, did Ms. Toriumi go home already? The teacher's log is a mess...
If she's such an expert on composition, what's with this syntax?
And these weird symbols to the side? Is this... some kind of face?
Won't she ever grow up...?

Mr. Ekoda
...Arisato? Why didn't you speak up sooner?
Don't think that people will lead you around by the hand once you're out in the real world.
...So, what do you want?
Ms. Toriumi seems to have left her share of unfinished work behind.

Mr. Ekoda
Having a teacher like her in charge of your class must be a severe impediment to your pursuit of education.
You'll never guess what she said during the teacher's conference the other day...
"I feel as if what I think you were saying isn't wrong."
What's with that? I can't make heads or tails of syntax that tortured!
Because of teachers like her... I can hardly blame you youngsters for your grammar, can I?

Mr. Ekoda
Now listen to me carefully. To begin with, proper grammar is...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I was lectured on proper
sentence structures...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mr. Ono doesn't seem to be returning.
I decided to give up for today.

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mr. Ono seems to have stepped out...

Ms. Toriumi
Sad - Argh, dammit! I did it again.
Sad - When does Class 2-F have their next lecture...?

Ms. Toriumi
Oh, Arisato-kun. What's up?
Happy - Ohhh, I know. You brought me some cake, huh?
Happy - I'm not a fan of Mont Blanc, but I like all the other kinds.

Ms. Toriumi
...Er, I didn't mean to say that. But, hey, you're here just in time!
I forgot to explain something in my last lecture, so I was just gonna go tell the class real quick.
If I don't do it, I'm gonna get reprimanded. It's tough being a teacher.
If I explain it to you right now, could you pass it on to everyone else?
Happy - It doesn't have to be a detailed explanation or anything. Oh, do you want some watermelon the next time I have some left over?

Ms. Toriumi
Ugh...

Ms. Toriumi
Angry - I can practically feel that old stickler Ekoda glaring at me... Damn, guess I'll have to do it myself.
Well, I might as well practice giving the lecture with you.
Happy - I-I mean, we've already established you're not going to give the lecture in my place, right?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I listened to Ms. Toriumi's lecture alone...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mr. Ono doesn't seem to be returning.
I decided to give up for today.

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mr. Ono seems to have stepped out...

Mr. Takenozuka
I should get going since there's no time to waste. If I power walk to the station, it'll take seven minutes...
But if I consider the speed at which the train pulls into the station, three minutes might not be enough...
Oh yeah... I'm in charge of dinner tonight, so that's another twelve minutes to get groceries...
I better compensate for the pressure ratio when mashing potatoes to avoid inefficiency...
If an average potato's diameter is about twelve centimeters, then that comes out to...
...Oh, forget it! Going home isn't worth the trouble! I'm staying at school!

Mr. Takenozuka
Oh, it's you, Arisato. Did you want to stay the night at school too?
...You're looking for Mr. Ono?
Now that you mention it, I haven't seen that helmet lately... Oh, uh, I mean, that teacher.
I don't have time to fritter away looking for him either, so try again later.

Mr. Takenozuka
You know, that helm of his really is a nice piece.
I'd never say that to Mr. Ono's face because I'd never hear the end of it, but it's fine craftsmanship.
The curved line at the top... It's an ideal arc for absorbing impact.
An arc like that can absorb about 48% of the impact from above.
Then there's the material. It's not just a thick chunk of metal.
It's extremely thin metal, in fact, layered with finely-braided hemp for added practicality...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mr. Takenozuka keeps going
on and on with his lecture...

Mr. Takenozuka
So, that explains that. See? Isn't it a wonderful specimen?
Hm? Its origin? I wouldn't know anything about that. I have zero interest in archaeology.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I learned how ancient
helms are constructed...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mr. Ono doesn't seem to be returning.
I decided to give up for today.

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mr. Ono seems to have stepped out...

Mrs. Terauchi
Wow... How is it already so late?
My darling's not home today, and I'm so lonely...
Hmm, maybe I'll have dinner with Ms. Toriumi. We could go to that restaurant with the interesting game...
What was it called again...? A mahjong parlor?
I hope I don't lose again... But I don't think there's any way I can win against Ms. Toriumi.

Mrs. Terauchi
Oh. Hello, Arisato. How are you?
Ms. Toriumi isn't here. I was just about to look for her myself, actually.

Mrs. Terauchi
...Say, Arisato, do you play mahjong?
It's very intriguing. The technical terms, in particular, are quite interesting.
If I play too much, I can't stop thinking about them for days.

Mrs. Terauchi
Mentan pin doradora! Riichi ippatsu chiitoitsu tsumo!

Mrs. Terauchi
I've said that stuff even in my sleep... My poor darling hasn't slept very well as a result.
Shall I teach you the other technical terms? Though I'd just be repeating what Ms. Toriumi taught me...

Mrs. Terauchi
Well, for beginners, there's "Only riichi!"
Then a few intermediate phrases, such as "I got a reverse dora!"
"Looks like you're waiting for one tile," or "You've gotta have more than two han."
Ooh, or advanced stuff... "You have a hand, don't you?"
"I have all the tiles you're waiting for," and "Mangan booyah!"

Mrs. Terauchi
...So far, I've only had chances to use the beginners' phrases, though.
But Ms. Toriumi is a very patient teacher. She'll tell me, "You should throw this one away," or...
"You won't get many points if you call that one, so I wouldn't," and...
"I dropped that tile by accident, so you can't ron it"...
She's taught me so much, but I haven't been able to win a single match.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I learned technical terms for mahjong...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mr. Ono doesn't seem to be returning.
I decided to give up for today

===============================================================================================

Mr. Ono
Ah, Arisato. I've been waiting for you... Okay, not really.
I looked and looked, but there's nothing at my house that's not related to Masamune.
This didn't belong to Masamune personally, but it still has ties to him, so...

Mr. Ono
......
Do you really need this? Maybe you've... reconsidered?
Not that I'm reluctant at all to give it to you, of course.
So I'll give it to you, but...
But...
You'll take good care of it, right!? It'll become a family heirloom, right!?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Mr. Ono gave me his (ITEM NAME).

Mr. Ono
You must be proud, Arisato. You've got a family heirloom now.
Yeah, I guess this is how it should be...
......

Mr. Ono
Well, I've still got a few of those left at home.
This is the second time I've given a helm to a student, after all.
That Bebe... Do you know him? He's an exchange student in my class.
Back in the spring, when he first came here, he admired it so much that I let him have it.
It does my heart good to see the samurai spirit is still alive in you kids, even those from a foreign country.
It must be because the glorious lives of the Sengoku generals transcend history...!
Masamune Date, for example. The amazing thing about him is that he...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I enjoyed even more
stories about Masamune.
I have a deeper understanding of history...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I managed to obtain a helm from Mr. Ono.

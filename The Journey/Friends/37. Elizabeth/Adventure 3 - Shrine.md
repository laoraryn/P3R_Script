So this is a "shrine"... It's quite similar to a temple, is it not?
A mysterious presence lurks here... Though it is markedly different from a Shadow.

Elizabeth
...Well then, I shall first observe the local traditions and pay my respects.

Elizabeth
I wonder if this is enough...

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's too much.
......

Elizabeth
Surprised - ...Is there a problem?
I'd heard that the effects of this mystical "divine grace" were proportional to the amount offered.
Happy - ...In any event, I have finished presenting my offering.

Elizabeth
Happy - ...I have finally finished presenting my offering.
Though I normally do not reside in this world, I wonder if I, too, may receive "divine grace."

Elizabeth
Come to think of it... this system of monetary offerings is very similar to that of the fountain.
There are a great many locations in your world where supplicants may request good fortune...
You live in a truly wondrous place.

Elizabeth
Surprised - Could those paper strips tied there be...?

Elizabeth
Surprised - Just as I thought... These are "paper fortunes."
I've heard of this game. People entrust their destiny to a slip of paper, finding the risk far too exhilarating...
I see... There are many possible destinies written on them.

Elizabeth
Well then... I'd like to experiment with this for myself.
Happy - Please wait here while I work on obtaining every single variation.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I decided to wait until
Elizabeth was satisfied...

Elizabeth
Excuse me... I've been curious ever since we arrived, but what is that equipment over there?

Elizabeth
Surprised - If memory serves, these are... a slide and a jungle gym, correct?
Surprised - I see. In the presence of a true god, upholding a pretense of gravitas is all but meaningless... What a magnanimous and introspective message!
If that is the case...

Elizabeth
Surprised - Fascinating...
Surprised - In order to attain joy, one must first claw one's way to the very top.
This playground equipment teaches a profound lesson on the true way of the world...

Minato Arisato - Selection
I agree.
You're doing it wrong...
Try something else.

Elizabeth
Happy - Well, that was certainly entertaining.
Now, could you please instruct me in the proper use of the jungle gym over here?

Elizabeth
Surprised - Oh, my...
I'm very sorry, but could you please teach me how to use this equipment properly?
It would be wonderful if you could start with the jungle gym over here.

Elizabeth
Happy - That was quite entertaining.
I would very much like for you to continue teaching me how to use the other equipment.
Could I ask that you start with the jungle gym over here?

Elizabeth
Sad - ......
Sad - I can't get out...

Elizabeth
Surprised - Oh dear... It's rather difficult... to maintain one's balance...

Elizabeth
Today was even more enjoyable than our other outings thus far.
......

Elizabeth
To be honest, lately I've been wondering...
Do I find this world enjoyable simply because of the novelty of the stimuli it presents?

Elizabeth
Or, another possibility...
Happy - Perhaps I enjoy myself on these excursions because of your company.

Elizabeth
In any event... I believe I'll have to negotiate with my master to install a horizontal bar in our room.
I'd like for you to accompany me again sometime, if you wouldn't mind.

Elizabeth
Well then, I suppose we should call it a day, but before we do...
Happy - I'd like to go on the slide "1 More" time. Shall we seize the opportunity and go in tandem?

Elizabeth
Woooooo.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After Elizabeth had her fun, we headed
back to the Velvet Room together.

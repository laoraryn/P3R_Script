The scratching of pencils echoes
throughout the art room...
It's been so fun that the hours flew by.

Club Advisor
Everyone. Attention, please!

Club Advisor
I have an announcement, regarding the recent Bay Area art contest...

Club Advisor
Hiraga-kun's painting was selected for consideration in the final round!

Keisuke Hiraga
Surprised - ...!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Wow!

Male Club Member
Your piece was really good! You might even win!

Keisuke Hiraga
Please, it's all thanks to my paintbrush. I was lucky to use my dad's quality raccoon-hair one.
It really helped apply the paint to the canvas, so I'm sure that's the only reason the judges even noticed.

Minato Arisato - Selection
You've got talent.
You got lucky.

Keisuke Hiraga
Happy - Th-Thank you, Arisato-kun!

Keisuke Hiraga
But I've only been painting for about two years now, so I never imagined my piece would go so far.

Keisuke Hiraga
Y-Yeah, you're probably right, Arisato-kun.

Keisuke Hiraga
I mean, I've only been painting for two years now, so I had to have gotten lucky.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - You should have more confidence in yourself. You've been practicing so hard.

Male Club Member
She's right. Everyone knows how late you stay.

Keisuke Hiraga
Thanks, guys. But I should be supporting all of you, not the other way around.

Keisuke Hiraga
I'm sorry, Arisato-kun. I should be setting a better example for new members like you.
Happy - I may not be much of an artist or a leader, but I hope we can keep working to improve our skills together.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can feel a sense of solidarity with Hiraga...
I feel like we're becoming better friends.

Keisuke Hiraga
Happy - I've come this far... I might as well continue this for as long as I can.

Keisuke Hiraga
Oh, look at the time. Time to head home, everyone.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I cleaned up and went back to the dorm.

Keisuke Hiraga
Sad - How do I convince him...?

Male Club Member
Wh-Why am I...?

Keisuke Hiraga
Surprised - ...!

Male Club Member
Ugh... I feel... kinda weak...

Keisuke Hiraga
Angry - Your breathing is impaired, and your lips are pale.
Angry - Did you get enough sleep last night? And what do you usually have for lunch?

Male Club Member
Ungh... Now that I think about it, I didn't eat breakfast today...

Keisuke Hiraga
Angry - Mhm, I see...
Just as I thought—looks like anemia, probably from an unbalanced diet. It must be all the fast food.
I recommend adding more shellfish to your diet, like oyster and abalone. They're packed with iron and easy to cook.

Good work, Doc Junior.
Will he be okay?

Keisuke Hiraga
Looking away - D-Don't call me that...
Looking away - This is just common sense. Being the son of a doctor doesn't have anything to do with it.

Keisuke Hiraga
Well, this is just my amateur diagnosis.
But you should still see a professional. I'm not a real doctor, after all.

Keisuke Hiraga
I'll take him to the nurse's office. You guys should head on home.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I parted ways with Hiraga
and went back to the dorm.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Everyone's eyes are locked   
on their canvases.   
It's been so fun that the hours flew by.   
   
Club Advisor   
Everyone. Attention, please!   
   
Club Advisor   
It seems the painting Hiraga-kun submitted to the contest really caught the eyes of the judges!   
   
Club Advisor   
And while it's highly unusual, they're going to reserve an award spot just for you, Hiraga-kun!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Huh? I don't think I understand. What does that mean?   
   
Club Advisor   
It means you're guaranteed an award. At best you'll receive first place—at worst, an honorable mention.   
The judges were impressed with your shading techniques and said you crafted a masterwork of realism.   
   
Club Advisor   
Congratulations, Hiraga-kun!   
   
Male Club Member   
Hey, way to go!   
   
Female Club Member   
This is the art club's first real achievement!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Wait. Then... that means...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You should tell your dad!   
Now you don't have to quit!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Angry - Y-Yeah, that's right! He promised me!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Angry - Yeah... Yeah, that's right! He promised me!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
He said I could do whatever I want if I won.   
Happy - So this means I don't have to listen to him anymore, right?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - We should all do something special to celebrate!   
   
Female Club Member   
Yeah, that would be fun!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - Thanks, everybody!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Especially you. I'm sorry if I made you worry.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - Let's go, Arisato-kun. You're celebrating with us, right?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hiraga expressed deep gratitude to me.   
I feel like we're becoming better friends.   
   
Club Advisor   
I don't mean to interrupt the fun, but Hiraga-kun, I'd like to fill you in on a few details.   
   
Club Advisor   
But don't worry, it shouldn't take long. The rest of you can wait outside the faculty office if you'd like.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I went to the faculty office with everyone.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Club Advisor   
Well, Hiraga-kun.   
One of the judges saw a lot of potential in you as an artist and had an offer for you.   
If you're interested, they'd be willing to help arrange for you to study abroad. How does that sound?   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Surprised - Study abroad? Me? A-As an artist?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Wow, as in overseas? Hiraga-senpai's amazing!   
   
Panicky Student   
Hey, are you guys from the art club!?   
   
Panicky Student   
Have you seen Hiraga!?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um, he's in the faculty office now for—   
   
   
Panicky Student   
Hiraga! I've been looking everywhere for you!   
Mikarin just fainted! Come quick!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Surprised - Huh? Oh! Okay, got it, I'll be right there!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Angry - I'm very sorry, but I'll need some time to think about this.   
   
Club Advisor   
He says he doesn't want to be a doctor...   
   
Club Advisor   
But he just can't ignore people in need. That's how he is.   
A doctor's son with such an eye for art... I never thought I'd be so jealous of a student.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - I don't think anyone's in the mood to celebrate now.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'll let everyone know what happened. You can head off now if you'd like.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I said goodbye to Fuuka and   
went back to the dorm.

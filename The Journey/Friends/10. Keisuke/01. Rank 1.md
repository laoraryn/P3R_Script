I observed the art club.

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Huh?

Student with Glasses
Um, you're not a member of this club, are you?

Student with Glasses
Do you know him, Yamagishi-san?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, yes, he's the one I was just telling you about.

Student with Glasses
Ah! So he's the one, huh?
Happy - I've heard a lot about you from Yamagishi-san, Arisato-kun!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - We're looking for new members to join our club, so I mentioned you.
Happy - I'm really happy you decided to stop by on your own.

Student with Glasses
Happy - And, um, I'm Keisuke Hiraga. P-Pleased to meet you!

Male Club Member
He should be the one introducing himself to you, Keisuke-senpai.
You're the club leader, aren't you?

Keisuke Hiraga
Y-Yeah, I am.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Still the same as ever.

Keisuke Hiraga
Yamagishi-san is back, and now we're getting a new member.
Happy - Maybe I should be a little more active here.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Wait, aren't you a third-year, Hiraga-senpai? Don't you have entrance exams coming up?

Keisuke Hiraga
No, I, uh...

Keisuke Hiraga
Don't worry about that! Hey, Arisato-kun, do you have an eye for art?

Minato Arisato - Selection
No, not really.
Yeah, kinda.

Keisuke Hiraga
Not to worry. You don't have to be a professional artist to join this club.
I mean, I'm just a beginner, and I'm the club leader!

Keisuke Hiraga
Heh, then maybe we'll get to learn a thing or two from you.

Keisuke Hiraga
Meeting you like this can't be just a coincidence. It must be fate...
Let's get you signed up, shall we, Arisato-kun?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Hiraga gave me a warm welcome.
I joined the art club and made
friends with the members.

Keisuke Hiraga
Just so you know, only club members are allowed to enter this room.
So don't forget to turn in your registration form.

Keisuke Hiraga
The art club meets on **Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays**.
But we don't meet on the days leading up to exams. We should be studying then, anyway.
Happy - You don't have to come every day, so just try to show up every now and then.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Who would've thought we'd end up in the same club?

Keisuke Hiraga
Happy - Okay, I'll get this all processed. Looking forward to painting with you, Arisato-kun!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After joining the club, I decided
to go back to the dorm.

The scratching of pencils echoes
throughout the art room...

Keisuke Hiraga
Everyone, listen up.

Keisuke Hiraga
As of today, I'm quitting the club. I'd like a new club leader to be chosen from the second-years.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Wh-Why? Where is this coming from?

Keisuke Hiraga
I have to study for my entrance exams.

Male Club Member
Wait, so then...

Keisuke Hiraga
Angry - I'm going to med school, getting my license, and becoming a doctor!

Male Club Member
Did your dad say you had to quit because you have to take over the hospital?

Keisuke Hiraga
My dad has nothing to do with this. I made this decision for myself.
I'm going to have to turn down the opportunity to study abroad.

Keisuke Hiraga
And since I'm so behind on my studies, I'll have to pull a lot of all-nighters to catch up.
Happy - I really enjoyed leading the club, so thank you all for everything.

Female Club Member
There's something different about you, Keisuke-senpai. You seem... way more confident.

Keisuke Hiraga
Happy - Hey, you're giving me too much credit!

Keisuke Hiraga
Hey, Arisato-kun. Can we talk upstairs?

===============================================================================================

Keisuke Hiraga
After today, we won't be able to chat like this anymore.
Which is why I wanted to give this to you now.

Keisuke Hiraga
This arrived yesterday. It turns out I earned an honorable mention. But the top prizes ended up going to a couple other artists.
Happy - It made me realize I still have a lot to learn. Like mastering the basics, for starters.

Keisuke Hiraga
Studying for the med school entrance exams is going to be hard, and this would only distract me.
That's why I want you to have it.

Minato Arisato - Selection
I understand.
But why?
Stop relying on others.

Keisuke Hiraga
Happy - Thanks.
Happy - Funny how it seems like I'm always asking you for favors, even though I'm older than you.

Keisuke Hiraga
Well, I won't be attending club anymore, so I wanted to give you something to remember me by.
Surprised - Oh, but uh, don't get the wrong idea, okay?

Keisuke Hiraga
This'll be the last time I ask you for a favor.
You're a really independent person, Arisato-kun. Not like me.

Keisuke Hiraga
Happy - I want you to know that I really respect you.

Keisuke Hiraga
Remember how we helped those people at the station?
They all have important people in their lives. Just like how you're an important person in my life.

Keisuke Hiraga
If they had died, they never would've gotten to be with those people again.
So that's why I'm becoming a doctor.

Keisuke Hiraga
I-I'm not coming off as arrogant, am I?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Not at all.
You kinda are.

Keisuke Hiraga
Happy - Hehe, see? I can be the reliable one sometimes too, you know?

Keisuke Hiraga
Happy - Uh, I-I just thought I should try acting more reliable, you know...?

Keisuke Hiraga
I did use to be the club leader, after all.
It feels like I went in a huge circle and ended up right back where I started. And I know it might look like it...

Keisuke Hiraga
But I'm not doing this because my dad's a doctor. I'm doing this because I want to be a doctor.

Keisuke Hiraga
And if you ever need an emergency operation, I'll oversee the surgery myself.
I mean, if I keep you alive, we get to spend more time together.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It seems like I'm really important to Hiraga.
I feel like I've gained a lifelong friend!

The Fortune Social Link reached its maximum level! You can now fuse **Lakshmi**, the goddess of fertility!

Keisuke Hiraga
Your health is everything. It's best if you never even have to see a doctor.
Do you get the proper nutrients living in the dorm?
Happy - Let's pick up something healthy for you to eat on the way home.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
After eating a nutritious meal with Hiraga,
I decided to go back to the dorm.

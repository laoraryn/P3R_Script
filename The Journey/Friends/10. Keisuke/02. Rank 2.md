Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The scratching of pencils echoes   
throughout the art room...   
It's been so fun that the hours flew by.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Let's wrap up for today. Good work, everyone.   
   
Female Club Member   
Whew, all done!   
   
Male Club Member   
All right, let's clean up and go home.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - ...!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What's wrong?   
Do you need some rest?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - This has been happening a lot lately.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I'll be okay. It'll go away in a little while.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - It's just a little headache. I don't think it's anything to worry about.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
You should really figure out what's causing the pain. It might lead to serious complications down the road.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Does anywhere else hurt? Are your nose and throat all right?   
Does it feel like your head is in a vice?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hiraga is getting the details   
on Fuuka's symptoms.   
   
Female Club Member   
Oh boy, here we go. Keisuke-senpai strikes again.   
Yamagishi-san won't be going anywhere for a while.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
"Strikes again"?   
Is that a problem?   
   
Female Club Member   
If someone isn't feeling well, he always tries to figure out what's wrong.   
And it doesn't matter when or where. Once he starts, it takes forever...   
   
Female Club Member   
Oh, she'll be fine. He's like a walking medical encyclopedia.   
We all appreciate him, but it can be a little too much after a while.   
   
Female Club Member   
Keisuke-senpai's dad's the director of a big hospital, and he's an only child.   
I guess he just can't stand to see people suffer. I bet he'll end up going to medical school.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
So the pain's originating from the back of your head?   
Could you turn around please?   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - Don't worry, it's just a chronic tension-type headache, most likely the result of stress.   
You might be spending too much time in front of the computer. Try to get outside and exercise more.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
...It must seem funny to get medical advice from the head of the art club.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I was worried I'd come down with the flu or something...   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
In that case, I can do a more thorough check.   
Could you remove your shirt? Also, open your mouth and stick out your tongue.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Wha—!?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - U-Uh, that's okay, I'm fine! Besides, our dorm isn't far, so Arisato-kun can accompany me back!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Ah, sorry, sorry— Wait, you two live in the dorms?   
I guess I see it in Yamagishi-san. She seems like the well-adjusted type. I bet you're a great cook.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Arisato-kun, do you take care of the laundry? Is living alone hard?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I think Hiraga has taken an interest in me.   
I feel like we're becoming better friends.

DEV: Label is not used   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Oh, sorry, Yamagishi-san! I forgot about your condition.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
I know it's close, but I don't think you should be walking home. Why don't I call you a taxi?   
Though a bumpy taxi ride might make your headache worse... Maybe a limousine would be better.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - U-Uh, that's okay. I'm fine. Really.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It's getting dark out.   
I said goodbye to the club members   
and went back to the dorm.

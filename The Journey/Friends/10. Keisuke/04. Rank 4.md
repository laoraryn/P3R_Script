Sad - Maybe it'd be better if I just quit.
Sad - The club would probably be fine without me. Besides, I...
Sad - I don't think I'm cut out to be an artist.

Keisuke Hiraga
Surprised - Hm— Wha!?
Surprised - H-How long have you been here!?
Looking away - Did you... hear everything?

Minato Arisato - Selection
You're quitting art club?
You're pulling out of the contest?

Keisuke Hiraga
Happy - Ahaha, so you did hear everything, then.

Keisuke Hiraga
Happy - Y-Yeah, well... I guess you did hear everything, huh.

Keisuke Hiraga
My dad told me to quit the art club.
He said I need to study more and concentrate on my future.

Keisuke Hiraga
When I told him I was a finalist in the contest, I thought he'd be proud.
Looking away - But all he said was that I was wasting my time.

Keisuke Hiraga
Angry - He said it's my responsibility to take over the hospital because I'm his only son.
Angry - My dad doesn't care about me! He only cares about his stupid hospital!

Keisuke Hiraga
Angry - And it's not just him, either!
Angry - Just because my dad's a doctor, everyone expects me to be one, too!

Keisuke Hiraga
Angry - I have my own dreams too, you know! Ugh, I can't stand it anymore!

Minato Arisato - Selection
Complaining to me won't help you.
So you're just gonna take it?

Keisuke Hiraga
Angry - ......
Angry - You're right. I have to tell my dad how I feel.

Keisuke Hiraga
Sad - Yeah, you're on to something, Arisato-kun.

Keisuke Hiraga
Angry - No, I don't want that! It's my life, and I want to live it my way.
Angry - ......

Keisuke Hiraga
Sad - S-Sorry, Arisato-kun.

Keisuke Hiraga
Angry - I've figured it out! I'm going to make a bet with my dad!
Angry - If I don't win the contest, then I'll quit the club, just like he wants me to.
Angry - But if I win, then I can do whatever I want! And as soon as I get home, I'm going to convince him!

Keisuke Hiraga
Looking away - Arisato-kun, do you mind keeping this under wraps?
Looking away - I don't want anyone worrying that I might quit the art club, so let's just keep this between us, okay?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Hiraga really opened up to me.
I feel like we're becoming better friends.

Keisuke Hiraga
Hey, would you mind letting the art club know that I'll be taking the day off?
I want to have the talk with my dad today.

Keisuke Hiraga
Well, see you later, Arisato-kun!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I was pretty active in the club today.
I wrapped up club activities
and went back to the dorm.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I can feel my bond with Hiraga grow   
stronger as we spend time together...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel like our relationship   
will grow stronger soon...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It's about time to leave school...   
I decided to go back to the dorm.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The scratching of pencils echoes   
throughout the art room...   
It's been so fun that the hours flew by.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hiraga isn't here...   
I wonder if he's working hard   
at his studies right now...

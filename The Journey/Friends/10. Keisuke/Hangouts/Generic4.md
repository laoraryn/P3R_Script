Keisuke Hiraga
So, this is just my personal opinion...
But I think that all our lives are predestined.

Keisuke Hiraga
If unexpected events in life are actually course corrections from whoever decides our destinies...
Then our lives can be described as scenarios written by an author.

Keisuke Hiraga
But I don't mean that pessimistically.
Even if your life is predestined, I think you should give it your all while on that path.

Minato Arisato - Selection
You have a point.
That's just giving up.
Sounds like an excuse.

Keisuke Hiraga
Happy - Y-You agree? Well, I'm glad I decided to talk to you about this.
I was worried that I'd sound too preachy about it, but...
If I only met you because I was written to, then I'd like to thank the author of my life.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Hiraga seems very happy.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Keisuke Hiraga
Sad - I know it's not a philosophy that everyone will agree with, but... Don't get the wrong idea.
Angry - It doesn't mean that I'm giving up. In fact, I'm more motivated than ever before!
Sad - A-Anyway, let's just drop it. I shouldn't push my opinions on you like that...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Hiraga has fallen silent.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Keisuke Hiraga
Hm... Maybe. But think about it. When you come to a crossroads, you have to make a decision.
And if what decision you make has already been written before you even make it...
...A-Actually, let's just drop it. This conversation is getting way too complicated.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Hiraga is smiling bashfully.
I learned a little more about him today.

Keisuke Hiraga
Well, I have to continue my preparations. I think I'll check for some books on the way back.
Oh, if you need help with your studies, feel free to ask. I can teach you my studying techniques.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The two of us talked for a while longer
before I headed back to the dorm.

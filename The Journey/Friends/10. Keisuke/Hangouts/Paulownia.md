Happy - I really like hanging out here.

Keisuke Hiraga
This is a cool-looking fountain.
Hmmm...

Keisuke Hiraga
Hey, we should organize an outdoor sketching session one of these days.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sounds like a hassle.
That would be cool.
Think we can do it?

Keisuke Hiraga
Sad - Oh, you don't want to...?
Sad - Well, we probably wouldn't have been able to set something like that up anyways...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Hiraga seems a little sad.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Keisuke Hiraga
Happy - I don't know if we could actually do it or not, but I think it's a fun idea.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Hiraga looks happy.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Keisuke Hiraga
Sad - Well, realistically...

Keisuke Hiraga
...But it sounds like fun, doesn't it?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Hiraga looks happy.
I learned a little more about him today.

Keisuke Hiraga
......

Keisuke Hiraga
Happy - Oh, sorry. So what should we do next? Should we get something to eat?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The two of us hung out for a while longer
and then I decided to go back to the dorm.

I've traveled outside of Japan a few times with my family.

Keisuke Hiraga
It was always a lot of fun, and I have a lot of great memories, but...

Keisuke Hiraga
Sad - Studying abroad is long-term...
Sad - I mean, I won't just be visiting; I'll be living there...

Think of all the new girls.
Think of the new inspirations.
Think of your new lifestyle.

Keisuke Hiraga
Happy - O-Oh! You might have a point there! A romantic encounter in a foreign land, huh...?
Wait, what am I saying!? It's not like I'll be on vacation! I'll be there to study!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Hiraga seems like he's having fun.
I learned a little more about him today.

Keisuke Hiraga
Happy - You have a point there... I'm sure I'll encounter a lot of things that I wouldn't if I stayed here...
Learning about different cultures could be an invaluable experience for a young artist like me.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Hiraga seems impressed by my words.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Keisuke Hiraga
That's right, if I study abroad, I won't have to listen to my dad's nagging all the time...
Sad - But I won't be able to see you or the other club members, either! I'll get so homesick...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Hiraga seems anxious.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Keisuke Hiraga
Oh, by the way, that fortune telling book I got the other day was pretty interesting.
There's a method called Tasseography that tells your fortune through interpreting patterns left by coffee grounds...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We chatted for a while longer before
I decided to go back to the dorm.

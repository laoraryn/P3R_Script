Happy - Wow, look at all our tickets!   
Happy - I didn't think we'd win so many... This was fun!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
It was probably mostly luck, though. Come to think of it, I've always been pretty lucky...   
Like with that contest. I didn't really want to win anything, and I didn't think I would...   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sad - D-Do you think it's okay for me to be in the finals?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, you just did your best.   
Believe in yourself more.   
The others just sucked.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Well... when you put it like that, I guess it's okay.   
You've got a real mature outlook on things... and I'm supposed to be the senpai here.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hiraga is looking at me with respect.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Y-Yeah, that's what everyone keeps telling me.   
I guess I just get nervous because I never really had any proper training...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hiraga seems a little embarrassed.   
I learned a little more about him today.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Surprised - Th-That's not true! There were a lot of great contestants from other schools!   
Sad - I don't care what you say about me, but you shouldn't put down other people like that...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It seems like Hiraga doesn't want   
to talk about this anymore.   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Well, this was a nice change of pace since I've been so busy with club activities lately.   
We should head back in a little bit. I have to start working even harder as soon as possible.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The two of us hung out for a little longer   
and then I decided to go back to the dorm.

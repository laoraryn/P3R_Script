Keisuke Hiraga
Lately, I've been reading all these autobiographies by famous people...

Keisuke Hiraga
They were all so successful in life. I wonder what they were like at my age...
I've been thinking about that a lot recently...

Keisuke Hiraga
Angry - I hate my dad! First he tells me to quit the club... Now he tells me to go study abroad!
Angry - This is all his fault! Why does he keep changing his mind!?

Minato Arisato - Selection
You're right.
You shouldn't blame others.
I don't really care.

Keisuke Hiraga
Sorry... I'm embarrassed by the way I'm acting...
You don't have to agree with me all the time, you know. You can tell me when I'm wrong...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Hiraga seems to be thinking
about what he said.
I learned a little more about him today.

Keisuke Hiraga
...Somehow, you always manage to see the core of the problem.
Yeah... Deep down, I know that you're right. I shouldn't say things like that.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Hiraga seems impressed by my words.
I feel like we became a lot closer today.

Keisuke Hiraga
Sad - B-But... I've been telling you all this because it's you, Arisato-kun...
Sad - ...But I was in the wrong. I'm just venting without considering your feelings... That isn't right.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Hiraga seems depressed.
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...

Keisuke Hiraga
...Sorry. I didn't mean to have a conversation like this when I invited you here.
Why don't we get some cake? I'll treat you.
Speaking of sweets, the human brain requires 20% of the glucose derived from the body's metabolism process to function properly...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The two of us hung out for a while longer
before I decided to go back to the dorm.

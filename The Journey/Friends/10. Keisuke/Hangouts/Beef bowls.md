I've seen them before on commercials, but they looked even better in person!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - That was the first time I ever ate a beef bowl! I didn't expect it to taste that good!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
My parents were always strict about table manners and what kind of food I could eat...   
I doubt I'd ever see something like a beef bowl on the dinner table at home...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I guess this was your last one.   
Let's eat here again, then.   
Maybe you should ask them.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Surprised - O-Oh no, you're right! I might never be able to eat a beef bowl ever again!   
Sad - If I'd known that, I'd have savored it more slowly...   
Angry - Wait a second... I can just come here again if I want another beef bowl! Don't scare me like that.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hiraga seems a little annoyed.   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - Yeah! Let's come here again! Please be sure to let me know the next time you want to.   
It... might be a bit difficult for me to come to a place like this on my own... So let me know!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hiraga seems happy.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Hm... Maybe I could ask the housekeeper... We'd have to keep it a secret, though...   
And I don't know about going through all that trouble just for a beef bowl... you know?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hiraga seems to be deep in thought.   
I learned a little more about him today.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
I've never really stopped at the strip mall here before, but it has a lot of interesting shops.   
Maybe I'll start thinking about the next one I'd like to visit.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
We walked around the strip mall for a while,   
and then I decided to return to the dorm.

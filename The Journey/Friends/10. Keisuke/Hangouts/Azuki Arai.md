Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - Eating Japanese sweets makes me feel connected to my home country... I might be exaggerating.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Well, I decided that I'm going to study overseas.   
So that means I won't be seeing you anymore...   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sad - O-Oh, sorry, that may have sounded weird. It's just...   
Sad - I'm an only child, and I've always wondered what it'd be like to have a sibling...   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
So... I was wondering... what it'd be like if you called me something in that vein...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
How about "Kid Brother"?   
What about "Senpai"?   
Okay, Brother.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sad - "Kid"? B-But, I'm older than you...   
Sad - Well, I guess I'm not very reliable, so I can see why you would think of me like that...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hiraga seems depressed.   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
W-Well, I am your senpai, but... Hm, maybe I didn't convey that right...   
I guess I should be more direct about what I want to say. At least I learned that now, before I leave...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hiraga is nodding to himself.   
I learned a little more about him today.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - "Brother"... Oh, I love how that sounds...   
Happy - Hey, um... C-Can you say it again?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hiraga seems very happy.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Oh, I always get carried away when I talk to you... But I need to buy more things before I go abroad.   
I should probably bring some products from here that I'm used to, at least for the beginning.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
After shopping with Hiraga,   
I returned to the dorm.

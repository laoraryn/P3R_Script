The scratching of pencils echoes
throughout the art room...

Keisuke Hiraga
Hey, Arisato-kun?

Keisuke Hiraga
Do you have some time to chat after art club?

===============================================================================================

Keisuke Hiraga
Happy - Everyone's working so hard...

Minato Arisato - Selection
So are you.
What's the matter?

Keisuke Hiraga
Is that what it seems like to you, Arisato-kun? That I'm working hard?

Keisuke Hiraga
Ah, sorry. I just wanted you to lend me an ear.

Keisuke Hiraga
Well, I told my dad about studying abroad.

Keisuke Hiraga
He said I should give it a try. And just the other day, he was telling me to quit.

Keisuke Hiraga
He's always wanted me to be a doctor till now, so for him to say that...
I just don't know what to think.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Will you study abroad?
It's your choice now.

Keisuke Hiraga
Y-Yeah, but it kinda feels like I'm doing it because that's what my dad wants.

Keisuke Hiraga
Y-Yeah, that's true, but at the same time...
If I study abroad, it kinda feels like I'm doing it because that's what my dad wants.

Keisuke Hiraga
Happy - Thanks. This has been eating me up for a while, and it feels good to talk about it.
Happy - You're really the only one I can talk to about this stuff, Arisato-kun.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Hiraga expressed his gratitude to me.
I feel like we're becoming better friends.

Keisuke Hiraga
It's great that you've always made your own decisions. Not like me, though.

Keisuke Hiraga
Sorry. We should get going.
Happy - My driver's picking me up, so I can have him drop you off near your dorm if you want.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Hiraga and I left school together.

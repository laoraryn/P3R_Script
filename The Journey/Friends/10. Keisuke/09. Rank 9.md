Internal MES - MND_000_0_0   
The scratching of pencils echoes   
throughout the art room...   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Hey, Arisato-kun, can we step out for a bit?   
I want you to come to the station with me. I'll tell you more there.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sorry to make you come all the way here.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sad - I, uh... suddenly have no idea what to do with my life anymore.   
Sad - Do I want to be a doctor, or do I want to be an artist?   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
I've decided to do a little soul searching. And I won't go back home or to school until I figure it out.   
I haven't figured out exactly where I'll go, but it has to be somewhere away from home.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
I've got plenty of money. I may have taken my dad's credit card from his wallet.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
I'm glad we had a chance to talk before I left.   
Tell the others I said goodbye!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You can't go!   
Good luck!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - Don't say that! You're gonna make this harder for me.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sad - I'll send you a letter when I get to wherever I'm going.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Promise me you'll take care of yourself!   
   
Pale Old Woman   
*cough* *cough* Ugh!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Surprised - Ma'am, are you all right!? That cough...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What happened?   
...You should just go.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Angry - She's having trouble breathing, and she's running a fever... This is bad.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Angry - I could never do that!   
Angry - She's having trouble breathing, and she's running a fever! This is bad...   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Angry - I may be jumping to conclusions here, but...   
Angry - Sorry about this!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Angry - I-I knew it! She's a smoker! This is really bad!   
Angry - I think she suffers from chronic bronchitis. So if she caught a cold, it may have exacerbated the symptoms.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Angry - Call an ambulance, Arisato-kun! Hurry!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The old woman was placed in an   
ambulance and taken to the hospital.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
We'll leave the rest to the paramedics.   
Well, I'd better get going.   
   
Old Man in Pain   
U-Ugh... My chest...   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Surprised - Sir, are you okay!?   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sad - My train's about to leave! Wh-What should I do?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Leave this to me!   
You can't abandon your trip!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sad - All right! Then I'll...   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Angry - That's not important right now!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Angry - I'll go ask the station attendant to call an ambulance!   
Angry - You stay here and perform first aid on him!   
   
Old Man in Pain   
Ugh...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
He looks like he's in a lot of pain...   
How should I help him?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Better leave him alone.   
I should talk to him.   
I'll try patting his upper back.   
   
Old Man in Pain   
*huff* *huff* Ugh!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
He's having trouble breathing...   
   
Old Man in Pain   
Ah, I'm oka— *cough* *cough*   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
He looks like he's in a lot of pain...   
   
Old Man in Pain   
Hngh! Gah!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
He flinched from the pain...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
What should I do next?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Better leave him alone.   
I could rub his back.   
I'll lay him on his back.   
   
Old Man in Pain   
*huff* *huff* Ugh!   
   
Old Man in Pain   
P-Please, stop...   
   
Old Man in Pain   
P-Please, don't move me around...   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Angry - Okay, I told someone!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Angry - Wait, I think he's going into cardiac arrest!   
Angry - Um, let's sit him in an upright position.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Surprised - Oh, no! His breathing... And signs of cyanosis!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Angry - I-I have to do something... I have to, or this man will die!   
Angry - I need your help, Arisato-kun!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Angry - Lay him down on his back. Gently.   
Angry - Now, if I perform CPR while giving him a cardiac massage...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Thanks to Hiraga's efforts, the   
old man's condition stabilized.   
The paramedics carried   
him off in an ambulance.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sad - At least I helped him as much as I could.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Thank you, Arisato-kun. I don't think I would've had the confidence on my own.   
Happy - I'm really glad you were here with me.   
Happy - We both saved their lives!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hiraga expressed his gratitude to me.   
I feel like we're becoming better friends.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
......   
I think I'll go back home.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
I finally know what I really want. That said, I'm not looking forward to apologizing to my dad.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - All right, then. I'll see you at school!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I parted ways with Hiraga   
and went back to the dorm.

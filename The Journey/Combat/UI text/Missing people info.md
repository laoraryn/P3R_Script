Forgive me for calling you so suddenly, but there's something I must bring to your attention...

Elizabeth
There seems to be a human presence within Tartarus between floors 48 and 53.

Elizabeth
It appears to be someone without the potential who heard the voices of the Shadows...

Elizabeth
If left alone, I fear they will become Lost and may perish...

Elizabeth
Please find and rescue them.

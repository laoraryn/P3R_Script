The clock started ticking...   
   
Everyone's HP and SP has been restored!

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - What's this...?   
Surprised - I think something new has appeared on this floor.   
It's nothing huge, but I'll give you another heads-up when you're closer to it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I think this device caused that tremor just now.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The reading that I'm getting from it is similar to the one from the entrance...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The shape is similar as well. Could it   
be a portal leading somewhere else...?   
I better take a closer look.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Hmm... Something seems different about this floor...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Is this clock... maybe like the one on the first floor?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
There's a booklet in front of the clock...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The title on the cover reads,   
"Great Clock Manual."   
   
Great Clock Manual   
"For those who seek to gain greater power from a common experience..."   
"To activate the Great Clock, a prerequisite quantity of Twilight Fragments is required."   
"After an offering is made and the hands strike twelve, then the Great Clock can be used."   
"The observer shall then reach for the pendulum while picturing a recipient of the Clock's power."   
"...Last day of the month, activity verified."   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The document seems to   
be from ten years ago.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The clock's hands are already   
pointing at twelve...   
I might as well follow the instructions   
and picture one of my teammates...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - What the...!?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts

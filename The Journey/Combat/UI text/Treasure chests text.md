   
...?   
   
What's that thing shining on my bed?   
   
I haven't seen anything like this before...   
I should hold onto it for now.

Minato Arisato - Selection   
Open   
Don't open   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The number of Twilight Fragments   
I have is ****. Using **** should open it...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I used **** of my Twilight Fragments,   
so now I have  left.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
If I had **** Twilight Fragments, I could   
open it, but I only have **** right now.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I don't have any Twilight Fragments   
on hand. It looks like I need **** to open it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I don't sense any more treasure chests here.   
It's still dangerous, so please try to come back as soon as you can.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That looks like it'll be useful. It's up to you to decide how to use it.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Ah, I thought that's what that was.   
Happy - That's a **Twilight Fragment**. They can be used on devices throughout Tartarus.   
You might find more in Tartarus or other locations with traces of Shadows.   
If you come across any going forward, you'll want to take them.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts

It seems the Temperance Major Arcana   
card can now appear during Shuffle Time.   
   
   
It seems the Devil Major Arcana card

It seems the Tower Major Arcana card

It seems the Star Major Arcana card

It seems the Moon Major Arcana card   
can now appear during Shuffle Time.   
   
   
It seems the Sun Major Arcana card   
can now appear during Shuffle Time.   
   
   
It seems the Judgement Major Arcana   
card can now appear during Shuffle Time.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It looks like a dead end. Do you want to head back right away?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Leave Monad   
Continue exploring   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Okay.   
Be careful on your way back.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, do you think you might have missed something?   
Well, there are no enemies left, but it's still dangerous.   
Please be careful if you're going to keep exploring.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This would've looked good on Aragaki...   
but he isn't here anymore...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It looks like what the chairman gave you before, doesn't it, Arisato-kun?   
It's apparently really rare. I'm surprised to see it in a place like this.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Maybe the owner of the antique shop could   
craft it into a piece of equipment for me...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It looks like you've seen everything here. Good job.   
I think it's a good time to leave now. Please exit back out the door.

Looks pretty good.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Hey, that's a nice-looking bow! I can use it, right?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Yo, that weapon looks beastly! But it'd take a real master like me to make good use of it, so...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Oh, a new weapon, huh? It looks even better than what I'm using right now.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Ah, that looks like a fine weapon. Would you mind if I used it?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh, there was a weapon inside. I think Koro-chan would be able to use that one well.   
   
Aigis   
New armaments acquired. It appears to be an upgrade. I propose a retrofit.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - A new weapon...? May I please use it!?   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Arf! Arf!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Happy - Well, what do we have here? You should let me use it.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Oh, we have acquired new armaments! May I use it?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
...   
Seems pretty good.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Ooh, that looks great! Whaddaya say? Can I use it?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Hey, sick armor. I think it'd help bring out my inner charm, y'know?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I think this armor would suit me well. Mind if I use it?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - What a splendid piece of armor. I imagine it'd be more effective than what I'm currently using.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh! Don't you think that armor would be perfect for Koro-chan?   
   
Aigis   
It appears to be a defensive article. I recommend allowing me to equip it.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Um, could I use that new armor? Even if it doesn't fit now, I'll definitely grow into it!   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Arf! Arf!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Hey, that's a decent find. I'll hold onto it if nobody's using it.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - That armor appears sturdier than my current equipment. Would it be okay if I used it?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts

Junpei Iori   
Happy - Aw yeah, upgrade time, baby! Let's keep it rollin'!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - There's no substitute for training, but I'll take solid gear where we can find it too.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - You have my gratitude. I won't let you down.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi

Good choice. I'll see to it that you don't regret it.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Equipment upgrade confirmed. Now I'm sure to improve even further!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm no longer getting a signal from the Shadow. It must be fairly far away...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Well, it got the chest, but at least it knows we're here.   
I'm sure it won't be able to ignore us if we keep opening treasure chests.   
So let's keep looking for chests. We just might run into that Shadow again.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I don't sense the Shadow anymore. It's probably pretty far away by now...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - It got the treasure chest... but I think it noticed us.   
We should be able to get its attention if we keep opening chests.   
Let's keep looking for them.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The Shadow's coming our way. Get ready!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The target Shadow has been eliminated. Good work.   
There aren't any Shadows left on this floor. Let's keep moving.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The Shadow's headed straight for us! This is our chance! Are you ready?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It looks like you defeated the Shadow. Good job.   
I'm not sensing any more enemies on this floor. Let's move on.

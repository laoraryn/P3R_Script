Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I knew it! Now we should be able to get to the Shadow, right?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Huh!?   
Surprised - Actually, the seal's still intact! But that should've...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Don't panic. Can you pick up any similar signals?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah, there must be something we're missing...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - Let me see...   
Surprised - Got it! I'm getting a signal from a mirror on the third floor!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Then we just have to break that one too, right? Fuuka, can you tell which room it's in?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Sorry, I can't pinpoint the exact location. There's too much interference from the main signal...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I guess we'll just have to go and find another mirror that doesn't show our reflection.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - It should be inside one of the rooms on the third floor! Good luck!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I'm not getting a signal from that mirror anymore. It looks like that did it!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - The main signal is completely gone! The seal should be broken now!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Excellent! Then the target's room should be accessible now.   
Still, we're behind schedule. Let's move!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's about time. Now we can finally meet the enemy face-to-face.   
Let's be sure to repay the favor for all the trouble it's put us through.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Come on! Let's get this over with!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Damn... Yuka-tan's lookin' pretty fired up.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I say she's got the right idea. My fists are aching for some action, too.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I get how you feel, but keep it together. We can't afford to lose focus against an enemy like this.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This mirror is pretty large...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Hm... A mirror this big would be convenient, but I'm not so sure about this design...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - I sense a large presence behind that door!   
Are you ready?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - There's a powerful seal on that door!   
Sad - You'll have to break the seal before you can fight the Shadow.   
Sad - We'll be in big trouble if the Dark Hour ends before you defeat it. Please hurry!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Why can't this just be over already? I wanna go home and take a shower...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - No dice, huh? Dammit, where could it be...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It doesn't seem like it's in there... Let's keep looking.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - It's completely see-through... Why would they design it like this?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - It's kinda creepy that it's see-through, but I guess that's easier for us... Looks like nothing's there.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hm, I'm not seeing anything... We'll just have to turn every stone.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Sheesh, even the bathroom door's way over the top. I bet it's the same inside too, huh...?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Think it could be inside? There aren't really any places it could hide in there, though...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Everything in this room is so fancy. Even the TV looks like it's top of the line.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - What if there was a Shadow in the TV!? Yeah, right, like that would ever happen...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - It's all such bad taste... Seriously, who'd want to sleep in place like this?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Not here, huh? I'd like to put an end to this already...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - They really committed to this theme, didn't they? Getting a little repetitive, don'tcha think?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Nothing... We'll just have to keep checking everything.   
   
Junpei Iori   
If it was actually in here the whole time, we'd have one ice-cold Shadow-sicle on our hands.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Nothing here... Where else haven't we looked?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
What should I do with this mirror...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Break it   
Don't break it   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
My mind is starting to feel fuzzy...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It looks like I already broke this mirror.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This mirror is broken.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - The Shadow is waiting behind this door!   
Are you ready?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'm ready.   
Not yet.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The door won't budge.   
A strong force seems to be holding it shut.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - ...!   
Surprised - What...!?   
Angry - I still sense a Shadow in that room!   
Angry - It's different from the one you just defeated!   
Sad - But where is it? Is it hiding...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - I still sense a Shadow in that room!   
Angry - It must be hiding... Try to see if you can find it!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Hm...?   
Surprised - Hey... Is it just me, or is there something weird about this mirror?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Nothing about this seems   
terribly out of the ordinary.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Looks like a bathroom.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It's quite a large bed.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I can see the bathroom through the window.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Hey! What are you staring at that for?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The scent of soap is still   
lingering from the bathroom.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - What're you— There's no reason for us to be here! Let's go!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari doesn't look very happy...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari is giving me an icy glare...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Ugh... It's getting to the point where just being back here is giving me a headache...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - "Back here"? Oooh... Did something... steamy happen while we were separated?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...You know, I pretty much already knew, but...   
Angry - Your mind just lives in the gutter, doesn't it?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Er... Sorry, ma'am...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hm? This bathroom seems recently used... But in the Dark Hour...? Who—   
   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - It doesn't matter! What's it to you, anyway?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Wha—!? What did I say?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - *sigh* Nothing. Let's just go!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Looks like a bathroom.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The TV doesn't seem to be working.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The signal's coming from the large room on the third floor. Let's beat it before someone gets hurt!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - What are you doing? We're not even on the right floor! C'mon, we need to deal with the Shadow!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Hey, I wouldn't get sidetracked unless you want an earful from Yuka-tan...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
The signal's coming from the third floor, isn't it? We should go deal with the Shadow.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
There's no time to relax. It's crucial that we eliminate the target with all due haste.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I don't think that's the right room... It should be more spacious.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
That's not it... The signal's coming from a different room.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
No, it's not that one... Are there any larger rooms?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, I think I saw a big door earlier... Should we maybe check it out?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Didn't we pass by a fishy-lookin' place before? Maybe that's it?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
There are only so many rooms. We'll find it eventually.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We're looking for an especially large room, right? It may look different from the other rooms.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The seal has been broken!   
Please head for the Shadow!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Looks like the elevator isn't working...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It's not working. We'll just have to take the stairs.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It must be out of order because it's the Dark Hour. Please use the stairs!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm getting a reading from the large room on the third floor. Please go quickly!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - The seal is surrounding the whole building. It looks like there's no way out right now...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - In other words, we're not getting out until this Shadow goes down. Well, that's fine by me!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The seal has been broken, so please head for the target!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Looks like a list of available rooms.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
What's this? Are these room numbers?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
There's a coffin behind the reception desk...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Oof, these rooms are pretty pricey. Good to know...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The vending machine doesn't   
seem to be working...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
They don't work during the Dark Hour. Let's go.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Holy crap, they upcharge for drinks!? Not that I'm buying, but still...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's the Dark Hour. You won't be able to buy anything.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
There's a chair behind the curtain.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This might be a guest of the hotel...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Wha—!? Hey, what're you looking at that for!? Anyways, moving on! Let's go!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - So, uh... this pretty much proves what kinda hotel this is, right? It's not just my dirty mind?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
"Family planning"...? What's this vending machine selling?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
There's a poster on the wall here.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The vending machine doesn't   
seem to be working...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
There's a poster on the wall here.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
This one's just a normal mirror, right? Wasn't there something weird about the one before...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This chair has a backrest.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
C'mon, this is no time to be putting your feet up!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This guest has been transmogrified.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This guest has been transmogrified.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This guest has been transmogrified.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This guest has been transmogrified.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This guest has been transmogrified.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This guest has been transmogrified.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This guest has been transmogrified.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This guest has been transmogrified.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It's a heart-shaped chair.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It's a round bed.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This guest has been transmogrified.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This guest has been transmogrified.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This guest has been transmogrified.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This guest has been transmogrified.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The door is locked.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Something's blocking the door from opening.   
Possibly a coffin inside the room...   
   
Junpei Iori   
I tried that door, but it wouldn't open. I guess it's locked.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Being in a locked room might actually be safer for anyone inside right now.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I checked there myself a short while ago. It's locked.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It's a small fridge.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Please break the mirror on this floor first before moving on.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hmm, looks like it's not reflecting everything... Do you want to try breaking it?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We can't know for sure if this is the right one, but do you want to try breaking it and see?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
This mirror looks pretty normal to me, but it's your call, Leader.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
If this one's a dud, let's try breaking the mirror in Room 205, okay?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, why don't we check the mirror in the room across the way?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The signal's coming from the third floor. Try searching the rooms there!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There's no need to break any more mirrors. Go for the Shadow!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - This thing takes up so much space... I guess it's no wonder, given its shape.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Oh, is this the type that spins? Uh, I'm just guessing; it's not like I know anything about that...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hm, this round shape... What purpose does it serve?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It may appear lavish at first glance, but the actual craftsmanship leaves much to be desired.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It looks super gaudy to me. But I wonder, when it's actually spinning...   
Angry - ...No, then it'd just be gaudy and tacky. Anyway, let's keep moving.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
There's something here...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
This person might catch a cold, sleeping here like this... But I guess we can't exactly move them...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Uh, Arisato-kun? Let's get going, okay?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Wait a minute... One, two, thr— ...! Um, so anyway, uh... Some mission tonight, am I right?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Hey, what're you staring at!? Focus on the mission!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Dude... If the Dark Hour ended right now... *gulp*   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Just how many guests are there? We've gotta take care of business ASAP.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
*sigh* Try not to get distracted so easily...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Stop gawking like that! C'mon, we still have to deal with the Shadow, you know!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Well, there's the mirror. So we just break it, right?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All right, then. Time to end this hoax.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Then let's smash this thing to pieces on the count of three! One, two...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Wait, hold on!   
Sad - The signal's close, but I'm not entirely certain that this is the right mirror...   
Sad - Could you check the other room too, just in case?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Wait, hold on!   
Sad - The signal's close, but I'm not entirely certain that this is the right mirror...   
Sad - Could you check the other room too, just in case?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
That's a good point... Better to be safe than sorry, so let's cover all our bases first.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Okay, there's the mirror.   
Surprised - Oh, wait... There's something different about this one compared to the other one...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You sure? It looks the same to me.   
You notice anything, Arisato?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Huh, I don't see anything different about it...   
...What about you?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Our reflections...   
The shape is different.   
I see ghosts in this one.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Oh, you're right...   
Surprised - Now that I think about it, the mirror in the other room didn't show our reflections.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - What? They're messing with our reflections?   
Surprised - Are they pullin' some sorta magic trick on us?   
Angry - Well, these are Shadows we're dealing with... You might be onto something!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Oh, now that you mention it...   
Surprised - This mirror is reflecting everything but us.   
   
Junpei Iori   
What? No way...   
Surprised - Holy crap, you're right! It's not showing me in all my heroic glory!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Really? I'm not seeing it...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hmm, no, I don't think that's it, but...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Actually, now that you mention it, this heart looks a little more... hearty?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - What does that even mean?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I can't tell if you're being serious or not, but I don't believe in ghosts myself.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Seriously? You're starting to sound like Junpei...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Well, you know, these kinds of hotels are the perfect place for ghostly activities...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Cut it out, Arisato-kun. We don't need you jumping on the doofus train, too...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, good, you noticed it too, so I'm not just going crazy. Yeah, that other mirror...   
There's definitely something up with a mirror that reflects everything except people.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, looking back on it, I think it's the same thing as the mirror in the room the Shadow was in...   
There's definitely something up with a mirror that reflects everything except people.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Wow! Yukari-chan, Leader, nice catch, you two!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I thought maybe I was just imagining things, but... I think the other mirror didn't show our reflections.   
There's definitely something up with a mirror that reflects everything except people.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Here, look. This mirror isn't showing our reflections, see?   
There's definitely something up with a mirror that reflects everything except people.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh, wow! Good eye, Yukari-chan!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
The mirror in this room is probably just a normal mirror.   
Why don't we go check Room 205 again?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
There's definitely something up with a mirror that reflects everything except people.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - The mirror in that room wasn't the right one. Let's check a different room.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Let's focus on trying to find the right mirror for now.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - The Shadow should be in this room, right? We have to find it!

Geez, it's so quiet it's creepy...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Junpei's not in this car, either.   
Sad - Come on...   
Sad - He should know it's too dangerous to go alone.   
Sad - Junpei was acting kind of strange, wasn't he? Why'd he snap and get so upset?   
Sad - Well, I guess we can ask him once we've caught up to him. Let's go!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - There he is!   
Angry - Oh no, he's surrounded by enemies! We gotta help him quick!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - What's happening!?   
Surprised - No way... Is the train getting faster!?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
No time for that now...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - For the last train of the day, there are quite a few people on board.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - It's weird to think this is actually a person...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - There's no time to go back! Come on!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You don't have time to go back.   
If the Dark Hour ends, it'll be a disaster.   
The passengers could be at risk... Secure the monorail immediately.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Your primary target is up ahead! Are you ready?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
There's no time. Hurry!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yes, I'm ready.   
Hold on.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - ...This isn't gonna pop open and jump scare us, is it?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Dude, what're you lookin' at that for? C'mon, let's go.   
   
Yukari Takeba

Let's go.
Hang on a sec.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
There's no need to return
to the station right now.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The dorm should be in
the opposite direction...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I should head to the dorm for now...

Mitsuru Kirijo
If we don't deal with them now, they're liable to make a move.
Our target's just ahead. Let's get ready to fight.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Are you ready?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Good luck.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - It's dangerous to fight with such a small group. You should bring more people with you.

Yukari Takeba
Hey, what are you doing?
C'mon, let's get going.

Aigis
We do not have time to waste.
Please focus on making the necessary preparations.

Junpei Iori
Dude! C'mon, already!

Where should I go...?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
There are several objects that look
like coffins inside the store...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Did someone forget their meal...?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The used bookstore is closed...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
This seems to be a takoyaki
shop, but it's closed...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Looks like these stairs lead
to the second floor.
It's late... I should really
head to the dorm.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It won't budge...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Where did everyone go...?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
What's this doing here...?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I wonder what's in these things...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Is this... a coffin?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
These things are everywhere...

Yukari Takeba
Where do you think Amada-kun could have gone...?
Oh, sorry. We should probably focus on the enemies right in front of us, shouldn't we?

Aigis
Our target is within our immediate vicinity. Therefore, we should focus on the task at hand.
Let us finish making all necessary preparations and subsequently engage the enemy.

Junpei Iori
I'm kinda worried about Aragaki-san and everything...
C'mon, let's wrap this up quick.

Mitsuru Kirijo
If we don't deal with them now, they're liable to make a move.
Our target's just ahead. Let's get ready to fight.

Koromaru
Bark!

Aigis
Koromaru-san says, "Two of us are missing. Where are they?"

It's dangerous to fight with such a small group. You should bring more people with you.

Are you ready?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Many encyclopedia   
volumes are lined up here.   
There are also star charts   
and books on geology.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
There are many files labeled,   
"Shadow Appearance Dates."   
They are stamped with   
"Do Not Remove" labels.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The titles contain many esoteric   
terms that I can't understand...   
They seem to have to do with   
psychology and psychoanalysis.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It's a bank of consoles.   
There are others in the room right now,   
so I shouldn't watch the videos...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It's a bank of consoles.   
A surveillance camera seems to have   
turned itself on and recorded a video...   
But there are others in the room right   
now, so I shouldn't watch it...

Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'll get ready to provide support, so you can head on over.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Okay, let's go.

Let's go.   
Hang on a sec.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - This Shadow is too much for a crew so small. You could be killed!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
All right... This is it.   
Are you ready?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - We can't afford to backtrack now.   
Let's take a moment to breathe, then prepare to engage.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Once again, I will be substituting for Kirijo-senpai as your navigator from now on.
Please let me know if you want to go to Tartarus.
Um... I'll do my best.

That one's special! Take it down if you can!


It's a rare Shadow! Do your best to take it down!


It's an enemy of the Death Arcana! Please, you've got to get out of there!


No, you don't stand a chance... You need to pull back!


It's an enemy of the Death Arcana... Let's give it everything we've got!


If things look too dangerous, you can always retreat!


Enemy reinforcements!


Another wave of enemies!


We've got more incoming!


Looks like that's the boss of this place. I'm sensing a surge of power... Be careful!


That's no ordinary Shadow... Keep your guard up!


It's the guardian of this area. Let's stay focused!


Multiple team members are out of commission!


Huh...? Leader! Say something! Please...!


No... Yukari-chan...!


Junpei-kun's out of the fight!


Sanada-senpai, no!


It can't be... Kirijo-senpai!


Ahhh! Aigis!


Oh no... Amada-kun!


Huh!? Koro-chan!


Aragaki-senpai's been knocked out! Someone help!


No... Can anyone help!?


Oh no, this doesn't look good...


Our leader's in danger!


Yukari-chan! Are you okay?


Junpei-kun's in bad shape!


Ah! Sanada-senpai's in trouble!


Kirijo-senpai! Someone help her...!


Aigis has taken heavy damage!


Amada-kun, be careful!


Koro-chan! You can't take another hit!

You dodged it! That's our leader!


Nice reflexes, Yukari-chan!


Great dodge, Junpei-kun!


Impressive footwork, Sanada-senpai!


Kirijo-senpai, that was a beautiful dodge!


Aigis evaded the attack!


Well done avoiding that, Amada-kun!


Good move, Koro-chan!


Aragaki-senpai evaded an attack!


You dodged the attack! Nice one!


The enemy fled! Four remaining!


The enemy retreated! There are three left!


It ran away! Two left!


Enemy escape! There's only one left!


The enemy's fallen back! That's it, everyone!

There's four of them! You can do this!


Three enemies left! Stay alert!


Only two left! You've got this!


Last one! Let's finish this!


You're all worn out... Try for some healing!


Leader, your health is low! Be careful!

Aigis has taken serious damage... She needs to recover!


Amada-kun, are you okay!? Can someone check on him!?


Koro-chan's in danger! He needs help fast!


Aragaki-senpai's hurt! He needs to be treated!


You don't have much health left. Can you heal up?


Just hold on until you warm up!


Yukari-chan's frozen! She can't move!


Junpei-kun...! He's frozen solid!


It looks like Sanada-senpai can't move!


Kirijo-senpai's frozen! She can't move on her own!


Aigis is frozen in place!


Amada-kun's frozen... He can't move like this!


Ah, Koro-chan's been frozen!


Aragaki-senpai is frozen...! He can't move!


You're frozen! It's preventing you from moving!


Just hold on for now! You'll get out of this!


Yukari-chan! The electricity is preventing you from moving!


It doesn't seem like Junpei-kun can move yet...


Sanada-senpai's paralyzed... He can't move!


Kirijo-senpai still can't move!


Aigis is paralyzed by the shock!


Amada-kun's been shocked. He can't move!


The electricity's keeping Koro-chan from moving!


Aragaki-senpai's shocked. It looks like he still can't move!


The electric shock's keeping you from moving!


Leader! Can you hear me!?


Yukari-chan's been charmed... Can you snap her out of it?


Junpei-kun's charmed! Come on, snap out of it!


Sanada-senpai's charmed! Can you help him?


Kirijo-senpai's been charmed! Is there anything you can do?


Aigis is charmed... She can't tell friend from foe...!


Amada-kun's charmed. Please, come to your senses!


Koro-chan! Oh no, he's taking the wrong side!


Aragaki-senpai's been charmed! He needs help!


The enemy's charmed you! Please, we're on your side...!


You've been poisoned... You're losing health!


Yukari-chan's been poisoned... Do you have an antidote?


Junpei-kun's poisoned. Watch out for your health!


Sanada-senpai, you're poisoned! Keep an eye on your health!


Kirijo-senpai's been poisoned... Can someone fix it!?


Aigis is poisoned! She's losing health!


Amada-kun's poisoned...! You need to cure him!


Koro-chan's poisoned... He needs help!


Aragaki-senpai's been poisoned... Please watch your health!


You're poisoned! Keep an eye on your health!


You're distressed. Just take a deep breath!


Yukari-chan, don't panic!


Junpei-kun, just calm down!


Sanada-senpai's panicking!


Kirijo-senpai's distressed!


Aigis, you need to calm down!


Amada-kun's panicking. Someone help him!


Koro-chan's distressed!


Aragaki-senpai's distressed!


It looks like you're distressed...


Our leader's confused! Someone back him up!


Yukari-chan's confused! Oh no... She's acting on her own!


Junpei-kun's confused! W-Wait, just settle down!


Sanada-senpai's confused! Watch out!


Someone's confused! They may act unpredictably!


Aigis is confused! Just try and calm down...!


Amada-kun's confused...! He needs backup!


Stop, Koro-chan! You need to calm down!


Aragaki-senpai's confused! Please, just calm down...!


Someone's confused! They may act unpredictably!


Your fear will pass in time. Just stay strong!


Yukari-chan, don't let the fear get to you!


Junpei-kun... Will he be able to fight...?


Sanada-senpai's too scared to move...


Kirijo-senpai can't do anything right now...


Aigis! Is she going to be okay like that...?


Amada-kun's afraid! Someone help him!


Koro-chan's shaking in fear!


Aragaki-senpai's too mortified to move...


The enemy's striking fear into you... Someone might run!


Our leader's agitated... Please, control yourself!


Yukari-chan's angry... Please, come to your senses!


Junpei-kun, snap out of it...!


Sanada-senpai's getting aggressive! Please, just calm down!


Kirijo-senpai... You have to clear your mind!


Aigis is losing her cool... Stay with us!


Amada-kun's losing it... You need to calm down!


Koro-chan! Don't get too angry!


Aragaki-senpai looks mad... Just stay calm!


The enemy's taunting is making you angry...


Our leader's dizzy!


Yukari-chan's stunned!


Junpei-kun's getting dizzy!


Sanada-senpai's stunned!


Kirijo-senpai's dizzy!


Aigis has been stunned!


Amada-kun's dizzy!


Get up, Koro-chan!


Aragaki-senpai's been stunned!


The dizziness hasn't worn off yet...


Thank goodness! Now it's time for a counterattack!


Yukari-chan's back up! Time for some payback!


Junpei-kun! It's time to strike back!


Sanada-senpai's back in the fight!


Kirijo-senpai's back on her feet!


Aigis is back up! Time to retaliate!


Amada-kun! Time to turn this around!


Koro-chan's back at it! Make them pay!


Aragaki-senpai's back on his feet! We're ready for a comeback!


You're back in the fight! Now it's our turn!


I think someone else could strike a weakness...


Someone can target a weakness! Maybe try Shifting!


Someone could hit a weakness. Try switching out!


If you Shift, you can target the enemy's weakness!


With teamwork, you can hit the enemy's weakness!


You're in bad shape! You need to recover before you get hit!


Enemy attack imminent! You need to heal, quickly!


You're really beat up! Hurry, you've got to heal!


Can you patch yourself up? The enemy's about to strike...


The enemy's turn is coming up! Heal now while you still can...!


The enemy's frozen. Now's your chance!


They've been shocked. They're wide open!


Your Theurgy's ready to go!


You can use your Theurgy! Go for it, Yukari-chan!


Junpei-kun! Your Theurgy's ready!


You can use your Theurgy! Sanada-senpai, do it!


You can use your Theurgy! Go for it, Kirijo-senpai!

Kirijo-senpai looks really determined!


Aigis's power levels are rising!

Amazing! It's time for an All-Out Attack!


The enemy lines are broken! Now's your chance!


Everyone go for it! You've got this!


Now! No holding back!


Time to finish this!


Victory will be ours!


Don't let anything stop you!


Understood. I'll look for an opening...


No good... It doesn't look like we can get out of this one...


Sorry, I'm still searching for an escape route. Just hold on for a little longer...


There! You should be able to leave now!


Oh no... I couldn't find a way out...


You can hit a weakness with this!


You have a skill that can hit a weakness!


Looks like you can target a weakness!


It doesn't look like you have the right skills...


Looks like you can't hit any weaknesses...


I don't think you have any skills for this...


You might be able to hit a weakness if you Shift!


Someone else could hit the enemy's weakness!


Shift to swap out and hit the enemy's weakness!


You have an attack that works well!


This would give you good damage.


Looks like you can deal effective damage.


You can use your weapon to strike the enemy's weakness!


You're in luck! The enemy's weak to your standard attack!


The enemy seems to be weak to your weapon!


Your weapon attack should be effective!


You can deal good damage with weapon attacks.


Weapon attacks seem to be effective.


You have something that works, but there may be another weakness you can exploit.


You have something that works, but there may be another weakness you can exploit.


I haven't seen any weaknesses... You'll have to use trial and error.


I don't know their weaknesses yet... Can you test something out?


Try using an item to hit their weakness!


Items can be a good way to strike weaknesses!


Oh, I think you have an item that can target the enemy's weakness!


All enemies defeated! Good work out there!


That about does it! No Shadows detected!


That's a win for the team! Good job, everyone!


The enemy escaped. Looks like the fight's over.


Swapping out! You've got this!


Shifting!


You're up next! Go for it!


Another switch-out!


That's the third swap! You're synced up perfectly!


And that's the whole team! Beautiful coordination!


You need to pick someone else...


You two have already swapped out...


That's a strong one... Be on your guard!


Nothing to be afraid of. Let's make this quick.


This should be a good test of your strength... But don't get careless!


It's weak to slashing! Swords will deal massive damage!


Strike attacks are its weakness! Just try punching it!


It's weak to piercing! Try arrows or bullets!


Looks like Fire'll work great!


The enemy's weak to Ice. Let's freeze 'em solid!


Wind is the way to go!


Go for an Electric shock!


Looks like the enemy's weak to Light!


Darkness seems effective here.


Slashing won't work. Don't bother with swords.


Strike attacks are no good here. Be careful.


The enemy seems impenetrable to piercing...


Fire won't work! Be careful!


Ice doesn't seem to have any effect...


Wind isn't good on this one. You'll have to try something else!


Electricity's useless here... Keep that in mind!


Light doesn't seem to be effective...


Darkness has no effect on this enemy.


The enemy's easily charmed! Do you have a skill for it?


It's susceptible to poison. See if you can take advantage of that!


The enemy might be distressed easily!


You might be able to confuse it... Want to give that a try?


This enemy looks skittish. Think you can give it a scare?


This one looks short-tempered. Maybe you can anger it...


Here goes!


This'll help!


Please, protect them!


Come to me, Juno!


Be their shield!


This is it!


We have to win...


Come to me, Lucia!


Here...!


I will protect them...!


Bring them to victory!


Oracle...!


I have to do my part...


I need to focus...


My Theurgy needs a bit more time...


Almost ready, Lucia?


It's almost time, Juno...


Yes... My Theurgy will be ready soon...


I'll start preparing the analysis...


I'll be able to scan the enemy soon!


Preparing to analyze!


I'm still setting up. It'll take a little more time...


What...? The scan isn't working?


Preparations complete!


Ready to scan! Shall I get started?


I can analyze now! Just say the word!


Should I scan on this enemy?


Analysis complete!


Hmm... Okay, here's what I found.


I see... So this is what we're up against.


I've already scanned this one.


Sorry... I don't have it in me to scan right now...


I've gained a new power!


Now I can support you all even better!


The enemy has a status ailment. This is our chance!


The enemy's suffering a bit. We have the advantage!


The enemy's weakened! Now let's take it down!

===============================================================


Please give me some time...!


I can start the analysis at any time!


This is the monster's weaknesses!


H-Huh...? I feel weak...


The enemy's aura has shifted...!


Hey, I can see the enemy's weakness now!


This large Shadow is of the Hierophant Arcana!


We don't know what it'll do. Be ready for anything!


This one's from the Lovers Arcana... It's the source of the mind manipulation.


Y-Yukari-chan...!?


No way... It split into two!?


What...!? It revived it...!?


They've separated again! But our damage is split equally between them!


Aigis...


This large Shadow's Arcana is the Hermit. Watch out for attacks that use electricity!


The enemy Shadow is charging up now!


We've stopped the enemy from powering up!


Wh-What's this!? Roulette...!?


The Strength Arcana seems confident in its power. Don't be fooled by its appearance!


The Strength Arcana possesses immense fortitude...


I have a really bad feeling about this roulette board...


The Shadow is back in the air! You can't attack it anymore!


It doesn't matter how many times he changes Arcana... I'll scan him no matter what!


I want to protect this world, and everyone in it... I know I can do it!


Nyx just changed to the Hierophant!


Nyx just changed to the Lovers type!


Nyx switched to the Chariot now!


Nyx changed to the Justice Arcana!


He changed himself to the Hermit!


Now it's the Fortune Arcana!


Nyx switched to the Strength Arcana!


Nyx changed to the Hanged Man!


Stay strong, everyone!


These two are serious... But I know you can do this!


Please be careful! I sense an even greater power than before!


Ah! Everyone has been struck by fear! I have a bad feeling about this! Please get up!

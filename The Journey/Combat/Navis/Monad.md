Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, please hold on a moment.

Fuuka Yamagishi
It's one of those doors, but... Huh... This one isn't shining like the others.
It feels different, too...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Is this the "structure" Elizabeth referred
to as "not dissimilar" to the other door...?
I should probably check this door...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Shall we take a look at it, Leader?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's check it out.
Yeah, watch out for me.

Fuuka Yamagishi
All right. I'll keep watch for anything on my end.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, are we not going to take a closer look at that door?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I was checking the perimeter.
I just got lost for a second...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, I see. Well, do you want to check it now?

Fuuka Yamagishi
That's a long flight of stairs down...
It leads deeper into the depths of Tartarus compared to the other doors...
Sad - It's almost like it's luring us to go all the way in... It's a little disturbing...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Yet another door, even inside the first door... It feels like a very long pathway.
It's a layout I've never seen before. Please be careful as you go on.

Fuuka Yamagishi
It's one of those doors again.
Since the layout of this floor doesn't change, this door likely won't disappear.
So we can explore it anytime. We'll leave it up to you, Leader.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - I sense a Shadow up ahead!

Yukari Takeba
Huh... It doesn't look very strong...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Looks weak to me! Let's take it down quickly.

Akihiko Sanada
It doesn't seem like a very strong opponent to me...
All we have to do is beat this guy to move on?

Mitsuru Kirijo
It looks like we'll have to defeat it to continue on.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - It seems rather weak for a Shadow inside one of these doors...
Sad - I have a bad feeling about this... Please be fully prepared if you plan to battle it.

SYS_TUTORIAL
Strong Shadows exist behind this door as well. Defeating them will earn you rewards. If enemies are too strong, you can always try again later.

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Selection
Open it
Leave it alone

Minato Arisato - Selection
Exit
Stay longer

Fuuka Yamagishi
I sense a treasure chest. It looks like there's one at the end of the room.
It might have something valuable inside... Do you really want to leave without it?

Fuuka Yamagishi
There's still an unopened treasure chest... Do you want to leave without it?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - This place is...!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Sorry, but could you spend some more time exploring this area?
Sad - My powers aren't strong enough to see everything in there...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Could you explore a little further in?

Fuuka Yamagishi
There's still an unopened treasure chest. I think you should open it before leaving.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - It feels different in here compared to outside.
Surprised - The atmosphere is unstable and the walls look like they're rippling...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - My powers aren't working very well here...
Sad - I can at least tell that it's not a very large area, but please be careful.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The door is tightly sealed.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Can you please return here? I'd like to go through what we know about that door.
Luckily, there seems to be a teleporter nearby.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure thing.
If you say so...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Thank you. I'll be waiting at the entrance.

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Selection
Enter Monad
Jump to our furthest point
Not right now

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The  is reacting...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
A Major Arcana card I
have on me is reacting...

Fuuka Yamagishi
It looks like the door has been unlocked.
I can sense strong Shadows just beyond it... Please be careful.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The door is tightly sealed.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Exasperated* - Nothing's happening...?
Exasperated* - Huh... I wonder if the tarot cards you have right now aren't enough.
Maybe there's a card that we missed somewhere...
Do you mind checking the doors on the other floors again just to be sure?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Exasperated* - Nothing's happening...?
Exasperated* - I guess we must be missing the key to open it...
Come to think of it, there was a similar door on a lower floor, wasn't there?
We might find a clue if we open that door first.

Fuuka Yamagishi
It seems like it won't open... Do you see anything that I'm missing?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Wait! The door is glowing!
But why all of a sudden...? Did you do something, Leader?

Minato Arisato - Selection
The tarot card reacted.
It's the Major Arcana card...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Exasperated* - A tarot card you have is reacting to the door...?
Maybe that card acts like a key for this door...
Interesting... This door certainly works differently from other ones we've seen.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I don't sense any danger in your immediate vicinity...
However, there might be a strong enemy further in, just like with the other doors.
Angry - If you feel like you're in danger, please leave quickly.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should we explore Monad?

Fuuka Yamagishi
You're in a deeper part of the passage now.
The passage is separated by doors and goes even deeper... Please be careful.

Fuuka Yamagishi
You can go further into the passage now. Why don't you take a look?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Exasperated* - This seems like the very last door... but it's locked.
I wonder if we need something other than tarot cards to unlock it...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It seems that I'm missing something
that I need to unlock this door.
Let's turn back for now...

Fuuka Yamagishi
I wonder who that lady beyond this door was...
She was so beautiful and amazingly strong...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
My battle with Elizabeth has
ended. It's time to get moving...

Fuuka Yamagishi
It looks like there's nothing else here. Do you want to go back out?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Leave Monad
Stay longer

Fuuka Yamagishi
All right.
Be careful on your way back. It's easy to get lost in there.

Fuuka Yamagishi
All right.
I don't sense any danger, but please stay alert just in case.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
This is probably the location
Elizabeth referred to in her request.
Beyond this point lies
"the ultimate adversary"...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Elizabeth is waiting beyond this point.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Enter
Get ready first

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The request specified that I must
take on this challenge alone.
It seems the door won't open if
there are others with me...

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'm ready.
Let's not fight yet.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - It's a strong enemy! Are you ready to fight it?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - You'll have to defeat this enemy to move on... Are you ready?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - It's a very powerful enemy! Please make sure you're fully prepared for battle!

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - What was that...!?
Surprised - It's as if the energy from the door surged through the entire floor...
Surprised - Oh!
Happy - I can see the floor layout! That makes it easier for me to guide you now.

Fuuka Yamagishi - SYS_000_0_1

SYS_001_0_0
With the energy released from the Monad door, you have now obtained the map information of the current floor and the floor above.

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - What could this be...? There seems to be some kind of... distortion in space somewhere on this floor?
Angry - I'm sensing something ominous... Please be careful from here on.

===============================================================================================

Mitsuru Kirijo
This distortion... It seems that door is near. It'll be dangerous, but do you want to head inside?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - I'm getting a reading of that door...! If you're going to go in, then please make sure you're fully prepared.

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES
What's this...? There's
something written on it...

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
That was quite the trip, but we found a familiar sight beyond that imposing enemy.
Happy - It seems rather secure... Can you get it open?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
...?
This treasure chest isn't locked...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Huh? You can open it as is...?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Saves us some trouble.
This is suspicious...

Fuuka Yamagishi
We are in a rather irregular area... I wonder if that's a special feature of the place.
I'm not detecting any danger, so please, check what's inside.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Ah, there it is. We're gonna open it, right?

Junpei Iori
Happy - That's what I'm talkin' about! I wonder what's in it this time...

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - And now, we get to reap the rewards. C'mon, let's see what we've got.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - We should be able to open that without worry. Check what's inside.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Good find! Now, try opening it...

Aigis
Happy - This is our reward for victory. May I see what you find?

Ken Amada
These open up in such a cool way... I want to try it myself sometime!
Surprised - Uh, I-I mean... Never mind! Let's just empty it and move on!

Koromaru
Happy - Arf! Arf arf!

Shinjiro Aragaki
I don't get the big deal about these... but you're gonna open that before we leave, right?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Koro-chan's excited too! Now, try opening it...

Fuuka Yamagishi
A tarot card...
It's similar to the ones you already have, Leader.
It was also reacting to the entrance, so there may be some connection there.
It's possible that other doors elsewhere would react to that card as well.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Another card? What's the deal?
Exasperated* - Well, we're not figuring it out here. Let's move on.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Another stupid card? We busted our asses for THAT?
Happy - Hang on—it's too soon to be bummed out! Maybe if we collect enough of 'em, we can trade 'em in for something cool?

Akihiko Sanada
That's just a useless card to me, but it has some kind of meaning to you, doesn't it?
Well, all I need is the opportunity to fight strong opponents. The experience I gain is reward enough for me.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Puzzling cards hidden away in this already strange space...
Happy - This Tartarus truly is a tower filled with mysteries.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Will that card open another door? Who would make such a mechanism, and why...?
Happy - Well, in any case, well done! I'll await your return.

Aigis
A card. Who could have put this here?
Or is it simply coincidence? I do not know.

Ken Amada
Another tarot card... Are these hinting at something?
I mean, each one has a certain meaning, right? Maybe I'll look into it later...

Koromaru
Woof?

Shinjiro Aragaki
I don't care what's in the damn boxes...
But if there's gonna be another fight like this one, take me with you. I don't wanna miss the chance to throw down like this again.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I guess this isn't something that would hold Koro-chan's interest. I'll have to get him a treat when we get back.

Fuuka Yamagishi
There wasn't a tarot card in that one...
Sad - If we can't open any of the unopened doors, maybe it's best to come back for now.

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
The mysterious readings seem to be coming from this door.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Could this be the door
Elizabeth was talking about?
I should check it out...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - I sense Shadows beyond the door as well. If you plan on entering, please proceed with caution.

Minato Arisato - Selection
All right.
Thanks for the info.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Okay! Please go ahead and open the door.

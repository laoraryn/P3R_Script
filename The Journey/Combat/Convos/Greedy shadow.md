Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Greedy Shadow defeated! Nice job!
Happy - We managed to recover the treasure it was hoarding, too!

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I'm beat... But I feel accomplished since it worked out in the end.

Junpei Iori
Happy - There's no way it could've escaped from me, Junpei the Lord of Speed.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - That was some pretty good footwork, but we were a cut above.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - That was quite an endeavor, but at least it was worth it in the end.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Unused

Aigis
Happy - Mission successful. That was a good workout experience.

Ken Amada
Happy - We did it! You know... chasing it was kinda fun...

Koromaru
Happy - Arf arf!

Shinjiro Aragaki
Sheesh, damn bastard made us chase it like some field day event... Well, at least it went well.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Exasperated* - I'm glad you're all safe. It's too bad it got away...
Exasperated* - It seems it took off with all the treasure on this floor too...

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Ugh, after we ran around so much, too! That's totally cheating.

Junpei Iori
Angry - I can't believe I screwed this up! We'll kick its ass for sure next time!

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - That was a big catch we lost... We'll have our revenge next time.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It seems our opponent was one step ahead of us this time... Well, we'll just have to be more prepared.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Unused

Aigis
It found a complete upper hand on us. I suppose this would be a case of the enemy being "damn impressive."

Ken Amada
Sad - Oh well, we did our best. Chasing it was kinda fun, though.

Koromaru
Sad - *whine*

Shinjiro Aragaki
Talk about a damn fast runner... Heh, guess I'm a sore loser.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh... But it seems that Shadow dropped something while running away.
Happy - Let's check it out.

Fuuka Yamagishi
At least I now have a full grasp of this floor's layout, thanks to us chasing it down.
I'll guide you to the stairs.

------

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - There it is! Please chase it!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - You're slowly catching up to the Shadow! Hang in there!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - The Shadow is slowing down. Just a little more to go. Don't give up!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - It's so fast that I lost its reading... Which way could it have gone...?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - I'm sorry, I lost sight of it again... Which way did it go...?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Considering how far we've come, we have to catch up to it! This is the last one!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - I saw it when it made the turn!
Angry - It's definitely this way! Let's go!

Junpei Iori
Scheming - Hehe, I totally saw where that shiny, giant thing went.
Happy - It's this way! Everyone follow me!

Akihiko Sanada
Scheming - I could see a glimpse of its shadow from my point of view.
Scheming - It ran off this way. Let's go!

Mitsuru Kirijo
It was faint, but I saw light gleam off of its body.
I'm not completely certain, but it should be this way. Let's hurry!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Koro-chan, you were able to tell which way it went?
Angry - Leader, please follow Koro-chan!

Aigis
I should be able to identify the direction it went based on the location that can be deduced from its footsteps.
I am quite certain it went this way. Let us go.

Ken Amada
Angry - I saw a glimpse of it running away from us!
Angry - I'm pretty sure it went that way! Let's go!

Koromaru
Angry - Woof! Woof woof!

Shinjiro Aragaki
I saw where it went from my position.
It's this way. We going after it?

------

Fuuka Yamagishi
Hurt - It's a dead end! It seems we went the wrong way...
Sad - Oh no, the reading is getting farther and farther away... I guess this might be it...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - It's a dead end... It seems we went the opposite direction as that Shadow...
Sad - The Shadow's reading is getting further away. It escaped...
At the very least, we can get this treasure chest it missed.

Fuuka Yamagishi
The Shadow's movement has stopped. It seems it's hit a dead end!
Angry - Let's hurry! Just keep going straight!

------

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - We've caught the Shadow! Now it's time to defeat it!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Now! It's in your hands, everyone!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - This is our chance! Don't let it escape!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Ugh, it's so fast! We're taking it down right here and now!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Got 'em! You ain't goin' anywhere, pal!

Akihiko Sanada
This is turning into a hassle... We're dealing with it now!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - So it's been consumed by its obsession with treasure... No matter, we'll deal with it here!

Aigis
We finally cornered it. There is no escape!

Ken Amada
Huh, it's actually pretty big now that we've closed in on it. Let's take it down!

Koromaru
Arf, arf!

Shinjiro Aragaki
Why you gotta run...? Let's just hurry up and beat the crap out of it.

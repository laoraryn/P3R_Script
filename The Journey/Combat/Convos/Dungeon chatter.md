Yukari Takeba   
It's kinda weird to be all alone together in a place like this...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...Actually, yeah, this might be pretty bad.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I know this is serious business, but I can't help smiling around you.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Wh-What is it? Did you need something?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
O-Oh, it's nothing... Please don't mind me.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm just a little nervous about, um... about how we're all alone together.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
When I think of being alone with you, I feel like... like I'm in pain.   
   
Aigis   
I'm not really sure how to explain it, but... it's as if my chest is swelling.   
   
Aigis   
Maybe... this is what it feels like when your heart's aflutter.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
......   
   
Aigis   
......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um... Is it just me, or does it feel kind of awkward tonight?   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh hey, looks like you're the only guy on the team tonight, Arisato.   
   
Aigis   
I see. So this is what you would call a "harem," correct?   
   
Aigis   
According to my data, every single man in the world fantasizes of having one.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Wait... Is that what you're angling for?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Well, ulterior motives aside, I've no problems. After all, this team is strategically sound.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, hey! What's up, Class 2-F? Let's get it!   
   
Junpei Iori   
We're gonna show them third-years what we've got! No holdin' back now!   
   
Aigis   
Junpei-san's motivation is growing exponentially. That is very inspiring.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
That's right. We can't let our senpais have all the glory!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Let's show 'em what we're made of!   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
...Seriously? Only us dudes tonight? Greeeat, just great.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
What's up? Is there a problem with that?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Er, no, but, uh... there's just nobody here to, y'know, soothe the soul.   
   
Ken Amada   
I could bring Koromaru with us. Maybe petting him will help?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Look, Koromaru's great and all, but that's not what I'm getting at!   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...I-I'm not scared at all!   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Reminds me of the days we used to fight back-to-back. Right, Shinji?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Hmph... Could you stop dredgin' up the past? It's distracting.   
   
Ken Amada   
......   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The three of us teaming up again certainly brings back memories.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Tell me about it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Those days, we just kept fighting and fighting, day after day...   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
All I remember is Aki gettin' too worked up and rushin' into danger on his own.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hehe... That sounds about right.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I might be a kid, but I'll catch up to all of you in no time.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Ken Amada   
I think Koromaru's saying he feels the same way.   
   
Ken Amada   
Let's get stronger together, Koromaru.   
   
Koromaru   
Woof!   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Isn't this the school hallway...? But now it's all distorted and creepy...   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
This really is the school, huh... The layout here looks kinda familiar.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If the school was this spacious in reality, we could get in a good workout just moving around.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Uh, no thanks. If you need some space, there's always the great outdoors.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
So this is where you all started exploring the tower.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
If only Shadows showed up during class... Then I'd have a legit reason to skip.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Could you please stop thinking nonsense and focus on the upcoming battle?   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Interesting... This area still bears some resemblance to the school.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I still can't believe this is a school...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Same... Sometimes it slips my mind, too.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Can we slow down for a sec? H-Hey, don't leave me behind!   
   
Junpei Iori   
What's up, Yuka-tan? You tired already?   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It seems as if both the appearance and ambience of Tartarus differ depending on the floor...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yep, and the layout changes every single time, too... It's a real pain in the neck.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
There are various Shadows here as well. That's why we need your support.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Woof, woof!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan seems to be saying he can go even higher.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
I guess not all of 'em are totally weak, but they still don't stand a chance against me!   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You can still win against a strong opponent if you play your cards right. Don't forget the basics.   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...Never woulda guessed I'd wind up here again.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It really is harder to hit a moving target... There's no time to concentrate on your aim.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
But you're doing well—because of your daily practice, I'm sure.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
There was a time when even these Shadows gave us trouble.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
This layout is similar to that of the school. I wonder where your classrooms are located.   
   
Aigis   
This area looks like the school. Are your classrooms somewhere around here?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
We gotta run, fight, and climb stairs... Yo, I'm actually pretty fit, huh?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Nothing here makes sense. Whatever happens, don't overdo it.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I wonder... Maybe we're this strong because of the power of our Personas. Or maybe not...   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's harder to predict the enemy's next move in the dark, but I've gotten the hang of it now.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Is that your survival instinct kicking in? Man, you're somethin' else.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Ugh, the way the Shadows wriggle and squirm is so gross...   
   
Junpei Iori   
I know, right? It's like they were ripped right out of a nightmare...   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Be careful when turning around corners. You might end up face-to-face with a Shadow.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Man, I'm parched... I'm gonna go ahead and say there are no vending machines here, huh?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Looks like we'll have to bring our own drinks.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Even if there were, why on earth would I buy a drink in a shady place like this?   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Don't worry. At this height, I'm still getting clear readings from all of you.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I'll try my best not to get in anyone's way during a fight.   
   
Junpei Iori   
C'mon, little dude, loosen up. You've got me, your ever reliable senpai, on your side!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Don't be afraid to ask for help whenever you need it. We're a team, after all.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, have you ever wondered who's been setting up treasure chests here?   
   
Junpei Iori   
I dunno, but it's prooobably... not the Shadows, huh.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right, let's keep moving.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Every few floors, there's some kind of Gatekeeper, and they're always stronger and nastier than the last...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, seems like after we beat 'em once, it's adiós forever, so we just gotta come out on top.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looks like this area won't present much of a challenge for us.   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Damn pissants... They're all goin' down.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Whoa... He's so friggin' intense, like some kinda lone soldier.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
A hero's got to have a sword, yeah? Check out these mad skills!   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
The fundamentals of fighting Shadows are similar to those of boxing.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*sniff* *sniff*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I wonder how Koro-chan feels about the smell here in Tartarus.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Man, I dunno why, but it's a lot harder to speak up when it's this quiet.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
There's valuable experience in fighting weaker enemies as well.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
The teleporters are really convenient. I wonder how they work...   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I can clear out any Shadows in this area. Just give me the command.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Good to know, Ai-chan! But, no worries, I can handle things here.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Ha, that's reassuring to hear. Still, don't let your guard down even if they aren't much of a threat.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I can clear out the Shadows in this area. Just say the word.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Good to know, Ai-chan! But, no worries, I can handle things here.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Ha, that's reassuring to hear. Still, don't let your guard down even if they aren't much of a threat.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
AHH—! Oh, what the heck. I thought I saw a Shadow, but it's just Junpei...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hold up... Are you sayin' I look like one!?   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The Shadows just keep coming one after another... This truly is their "nest."   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I don't feel tired yet. Let's keep exploring!   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh c'mon, the same kind of floor again? Doesn't that mean...?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...Yeah, it means we can't let our guard down.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Keep your guard up and proceed with caution.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You shouldn't have any trouble on this floor, but please be careful regardless.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Right. You never know what'll happen.   
   
Aigis   
Roger that. I will stay alert.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It's so quiet, you can hear our footsteps echo...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, you hear another pair of footsteps...? PSYCH!   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It'd be great if we could go to Tartarus regularly. Nothing beats getting actual combat experience.   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...We ain't got much time, right? Then we better get a move on.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sometimes the enemies gang up and fight together, right? Do ya think they get along?   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We can't afford to be careless... But I doubt you'll have any trouble in this area.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
The mission I was given... is to eliminate Shadows.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I don't think we have to go after the ones that run away. We'd just be fighting this whole time if we did.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Make sure you leave some for me though.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
My mission... is to eliminate Shadows.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I don't think we have to go after the ones that run away. We'd just be fighting this whole time if we did.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Make sure you leave some for me though.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I've no problems walking onto a battlefield. It gets me really psyched up.   
   
Junpei Iori   
A... "battlefield"? I mean, I guess you could say we're kinda at war?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...You do understand this isn't a game, right?   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Let's see... You're on the 19th floor. That's nearly the height of a skyscraper.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Good thing we have teleporters... We'd never get this far if we had to climb up from the bottom every time.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Fortunately, those teleporters allow us to save both time and energy.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*whine*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan, are you getting hungry?   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...No matter how many Shadows we beat, there's always more coming our way.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If any Shadows stand in our way, they're going down.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'll be compiling a report of everything we observe on this expedition.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'll help, too. Hopefully, we learn something from all of this...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Don't forget to include our battle data, too. Information is a powerful weapon.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Phew, looks like we can take a breather. We're making good progress.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
The other night, I woke up screaming "PERSONA!" in my sleep.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Please try not to do that in class or something... It'd be a hassle if people started asking questions.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I think I'm starting to get the hang of fighting... I'll do even better next time.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'm all warmed up and ready to go. They can come at me anytime.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
As confident as ever... But I guess I'd be too, if I were as strong as you.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Now, let us proceed to even higher floors.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
If you're having any trouble, please come back, okay?   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Okay, let's aim for even higher floors.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
If you're having any trouble, please come back, okay?   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
This place has a totally different vibe... Wha—!? A face!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's certainly unsettling, but... all we can do is press on.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It looks like all of you have gotten used to fighting with your Personas now.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh yeah, didn't even break a sweat! After all, I am the ace of the team, right?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah, the second-years can hold their own, too. They're adapting way better than I expected.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Y'know, the faces on the wall look kinda familiar... Kinda like... me?   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What a bizarre sight... And yet, impressive in a way.   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Tch... This place gives me the damn creeps.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
The faces on the wall are seriously creepy... They're not actually watching us, are they?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Is this a rock, or is it actually, like... living and breathing? I ain't got a clue.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...Watch your step. Wouldn't want to trip over a stray rock on the ground.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Grrrr!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It seems like those large faces are agitating him... Don't worry, Koro-chan. You're okay.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Is it me or are the enemies getting stronger...? Well, either way, we're not gonna lose.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Damn, these faces are seriously gross... The interior designer must be real sick in the head.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It's dark here, so please watch your step.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You guys have a knack for this. Maybe you should give martial arts a try!   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I understand that this labyrinth changes every time we come here... But it's still vexing.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
It's so creepy here... Just like a nightmare.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Crap... My bladder's about to burst.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
What!? You should've gone to the restroom before we left!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Really now? Be careful not to let it distract you.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It's so dark... If only we had a flashlight— Oh, but I guess it wouldn't work during the Dark Hour.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All these floors look the same. Try not to get lost.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Always make sure that you reserve some of your strength, just to be safe.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeah, if we go too hard, we'll be runnin' on empty in no time...   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I am still fully operational. Awaiting orders.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That's some incredible fortitude.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Make sure to watch your health as you proceed!   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I can keep going. Awaiting your orders!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That's some incredible fortitude.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Make sure to watch your health as you proceed!   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
This limestone cave thingy is actually kinda pretty...   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
We've come quite a ways up. Don't you wanna just take a little peek out the window?   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Dunno how far we'll have to go, but we got a long road ahead of us...   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Even if we're able to head upstairs, we should try to take out as many enemies as we can.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Huh...? Wouldn't it be better to avoid unnecessary conflict?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeah, that's a tough call... We might've missed some loot, too.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sometimes I feel bad being the only one in a safe spot... And all I can do is provide support.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Without your help, we wouldn't be this far along in our exploration. Be more confident in yourself.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
What are you talking about? Having you there is the best way to help you help us!   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*sniff* *sniff*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
He's sniffing the floor... Does that mean the Shadows mark their territory?   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
H-Hey... Did you hear something just now? N-Not that I'm scared or anything!   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
The Shadows are getting even stronger, huh? Well, not that they're any match for me!   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Honestly speaking, the operation to save Yamagishi was a real gamble.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, can we take a break? I'm getting tired of the same old view.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That's fine, but keep your guard up in case of an enemy ambush.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I know how you feel, but the scenery probably won't change any time soon.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'm not pulling any punches, not even against a weaker opponent. That's just how I roll.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
There's no way to know what'll happen, so we should probably pace ourselves, right?   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I feel like I'm gaining more muscle mass... I don't really want visible abs.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Huh? Is that bad? I kinda wish I had defined abs...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You won't build a six-pack that easily. A three-month training regimen would be ideal.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Don't lose focus. Just one mistake, and it could cost you your life.   
   
Junpei Iori   
No kidding. Our enemies just keep poppin' outta the woodwork. Guess they're as desperate as us.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Easier said than done... Staying alert all the time is really exhausting.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sometimes we run into some pretty tough enemies, but they spice things up every now and then.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Please take care not to get lost. I am not equipped with a navigation system.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh... It's kinda weird you don't come with a GPS or somethin'.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Please try not to get lost. I don't have a navigational system installed.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh... It's kinda weird you don't come with a GPS or somethin'.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Ugh, why do they keep getting in our way!? They really don't want to let us through that badly?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
With every battle, I can feel myself growing stronger.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Without teleporters... it'd be even more difficult to explore this place.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
WHOA! What the hell, why's the floor so dang bumpy here...?   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's a miracle Yamagishi was able to survive for as long as she did, all by herself...   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You know, this place reminds me of a movie I saw before... Um, what was it called again?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I-I don't wanna know! It was probably a horror movie anyway!   
   
Junpei Iori   
The bad guy was probably one terrifyin' dude, but in the end, we'll save the day... Right?   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I think I've finally gotten used to seeing these faces everywhere... Wait, did it just look at us!?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I hope you guys can pick up something from watching me fight.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
I can hold my own in a fight pretty damn well, don'tcha think? I always knew I had talent!   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
About those... "treasure chests," as we've been calling them... It's up to you whether or not we open them.   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
You sure found a couple of oddballs while I was gone...   
   
Aigis   
Could you elaborate? To whom do you refer to as an "oddball"?   
   
Koromaru   
Woof, woof!   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You know... I think I'm getting pretty good at fighting.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's important to know when to call it quits, especially in a longer fight.   
   
Junpei Iori   
We can keep goin'! Right, Minato?   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan doesn't seem to be afraid of the enemies around here.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Recently, during archery practice... I see the target as a Shadow sometimes.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Haha, you got work on the brain, huh. Wait... This ain't a job, though.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Must be pretty hard to decide the starting lineup now that there's more of us. Well, I'd say I'm a solid pick, sooo...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Where do you get your confidence? There are enemies that are a bad matchup for you, too.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That's Arisato's call. Just know that I'm always ready to go.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Sometimes, when crossing through Tartarus, an indescribable fear overwhelms me.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh, so even you have things you're afraid of, Kirijo-senpai...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I feel that way all the time... But I guess I kinda got used to it by now.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Who on earth designed those faces on the walls?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Uh, I think the more important question is who built this crazy tower in the first place...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Maybe the Shadows...? Actually, I can't see them doing that.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Hm, by any chance... do you recognize any of the large faces in this area?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Uh, wouldn't it be even freakier if I did!?   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Hm... By any chance, do you happen to know any of the large faces around here?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Uh, wouldn't it be even freakier if I did!?   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
How's your health and stamina? Don't push yourself too hard, okay?   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Now that our team has grown, maybe it's time for me to take it easy... Just kidding.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Unfortunately, the more we advance, the stronger the enemies get. We can't let our guard down.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Mitsuru's Persona was always more geared for combat. Don't be afraid to have her in the front lines.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You don't need to go easy on me. I'll try not to disappoint.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...I have to be hard on myself so people won't think I've lost my edge.   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
They just keep comin'... Ain't there one with more bite?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Did you know that there's an observation deck somewhere out there that's also on the 45th floor?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, um... Which observation deck?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
And where exactly is "somewhere out there"? You left out the most important part...   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It seems like the total area can vary by floor...   
   
Junpei Iori   
A smaller floor would sure make things easier for us.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Here's hoping the next floors will be smaller. That way, we'll progress even faster.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
Those creepy faces are really unsettling... Not that I'm afraid of them or anything.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I think I've finally gotten used to the atmosphere here.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If I'd been tossed in here, uninformed and unarmed... I would've found myself in trouble, too.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
...Thank you again for saving me back then. I'm glad I didn't give up.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yamagishi is a significant boon to our team. Information is essential while exploring.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm just glad to be of assistance! I won't let you down!   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm picking up some signals of stronger Shadows. I'll let you know when I pinpoint their location.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Thanks. That'll buy us some time to prepare ourselves.   
   
Junpei Iori   
That's what we like to hear, Fuuka! Give us all the deets, girl!   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Fuuka's great, but I also miss Kirijo-senpai navigating. It kinda felt like... getting stepped on?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...I'm not sure what you mean by that, but did you want to be punished?   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
As expected... My abilities are much better suited for the front lines.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan is sticking out his tongue. Is he feeling hot?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, Fuuka, could you sing us a song every once in a while? Like something to get us pumped up.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Huh!? Like, right now? But I only know the school anthem...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Classic Stupei... Fuuka, there's no need to listen to him.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Considering how quiet and spacious this place is, it might be a decent training spot, if it weren't so unsettling.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There are so many twists and turns here. Be careful you don't get ambushed by any Shadows.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Please inform me if you are tired. I will carry you to the next floor.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I'm starting to get some mixed feelings about that...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Don't worry. I'm perfectly capable of walking on my own.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Please let me know if you ever get tired. I can carry you.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I'm starting to get some mixed feelings about that...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Don't worry. I'm perfectly capable of walking on my own.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Who knew you could buy weapons from the police station...? But I guess that's a good thing for us.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Dude, Fuuka's power is so sick. Do ya think it could help me find a book I lost in my room?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
...I'm sure you can find it yourself if you look hard enough.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Before you ask Yamagishi for help, maybe you should clean up your room first.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Tartarus... Also known as the deep abyss of the underworld. What secrets lie here, nobody knows.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
How fitting... Because I'm gonna make this place a living hell for the Shadows.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
There's no end to these Shadows... That just means I'll always have a sparring partner.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You've probably already noticed this, but those Shadows wandering around will always appear.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We'll just have to pick and choose our battles, though sometimes that's not always an option.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Let's pace ourselves so we don't get burnt out, especially at a critical moment.   
   
S------   
   
hinjiro Aragaki   
I ain't one for playing it safe. If there's an opening, I'm goin' all in.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Heh, I see you're the same as always. But don't let me hold you back.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Kirijo-senpai, that weapon of yours is so you.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What exactly do you mean by that? I suppose I ought to take it as a compliment.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh, really? I figured she'd use a whip or something...   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If we could build our endurance, we wouldn't lose as much stamina while we're on the move.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
Looks like we still have a long road ahead of us...   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Even though these floors all look the same, let's try not to run ourselves ragged!   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
This outfit is da bomb dot com! I'm a sucker for some nice, sleek threads.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's unfortunate the only way through all these narrow passages and staircases... is on foot.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I think my visual field has expanded a little. Maybe I've gotten used to this.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Exploring Tartarus is very physically demanding. It could be an ideal workout for those lacking exercise.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, I was thinking the same thing. I wonder if there's a way to count how many calories we burn.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Makes sense. Even one fight is enough to work up a good sweat.   
   
------

Akihiko Sanada   
Makes sense. Even one fight is enough to work up a good sweat.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Doesn't it hurt to hit Shadows with your bare fists, Sanada-senpai?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well, that won't be an issue if you're dedicated to training. Then the only one hurting is your opponent.   
   
Junpei Iori   
...Honestly, it's more impressive that Sanada-san ain't afraid of touching 'em.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Junpei, Junpei! He's our man! If he can't do it, no one can! Now gimme some double fives!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Uh, no.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Yayyy— Oh! Um...   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
...It looks dark over there, so please watch your step.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well, that's annoying. It'll be hard to spot Shadows like this.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sheesh, ain't this supposed to be a school? Where are all the ceiling lights?   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Why don't we go to karaoke sometime? It'd be a fun way to relieve stress.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Aw yeah, count me in! Don't let my beautiful singing voice shock you, alright?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I've heard that the word "karaoke" is derived from the Japanese word for "empty" and an English loanword for "orchestra."   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I tried measuring my strength at a boxing machine the other day, but it errored out when I punched it... Hmm, I wonder why.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Always be mindful of your health. You never know when we'll encounter a powerful foe.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Y'all doing alright? This is a piece of cake for me.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Well, that's reassuring. Just don't let the rug get pulled out from under you.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Are you seriously bragging? Don't come crying to us if you dig yourself a hole!   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I wish I could use my power to check a few more floors ahead...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Heh, you're doing fine. Just do what you can and leave the rest to us.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You're doing more than enough. We're covering so much more ground than we had previously.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Woof!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hehe... When I hear Koro-chan bark, I feel energized.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I got in plenty of running while I was recuperating. I won't be caught off-guard like that again.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You're lucky your injuries weren't worse. Try to be more careful next time.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm reminded of how you can only hone your fighting instincts through actual experience.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm still a little scared of the faces on the walls... It seems like they could start moving any time now.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Don't say that... Now you've got me feeling paranoid.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
How does this place change shape every time we enter? It's so bizarre...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeah, seriously... You think maybe there's a bunch of creepy-crawlies movin' stuff around?   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I shouldn't say this out loud, but... does anyone else feel super refreshed after dozing off in class?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh yeah, same. I have to get some shuteye during class so that I'm raring to go at night, you know?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that. Everyone, be sure to take care of yourselves.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
I know it's probably a little too late to ask this, but how come the terrain changes every time we enter?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Maybe... they just don't want us going any further?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm not sure, but... it kind of feels as if this place is alive, doesn't it?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Rather than using the teleporters, why don't we try running up from the bottom?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh god, did my pants rip? Is my ass showing? Could someone take a look, please!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...Who'd want to see that.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I-I'll help you check when you get back, so please just try to deal with it for now!   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Those Gatekeepers... They're getting stronger. We'll have to be even more vigilant.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The Shadows wandering around here seem to have varying levels of strength.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
So we could be facing a featherweight or a total powerhouse... If we're not careful, it could cost us our lives.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sure hope we only run into a bunch of wimps...   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
The 60th floor, huh... Not like there's a point to keepin' track though.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Whew... Should we head back or press on a little more? As leader, the decision is yours.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
On the nights we don't come out here, should I go jogging during the Dark Hour instead?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Seriously...? I'd rather just hit the hay, like a normal person.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
What does everyone else do? Since there's no electricity, I'd probably just go to bed...   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I am ready to eliminate Shadows at any time. Standing by for your OK.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Uh, could you, like, not look at me when you say that!? It's freaky!   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I can eliminate Shadows at any time. Just give me the OK.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Uh, could you, like, not look at me when you say that!? It's freaky!   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Somethin' about this place makes me lose track of time...   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I never thought it possible to wield multiple Personas... It's an extraordinary power.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeah, must be pretty rare. Don'tcha think it's kinda unfair you're the only one?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
But thanks to you, Arisato-kun, we have a lot of diverse battle tactics.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Focus... Check the floor layout... And the location of the Shadows...   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
There's more to building muscle than working out. You need a proper diet and rest, too.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
According to some mythologies, once you enter Tartarus, you'll never be able to escape...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh... But we made it out just fine. Ain't that somethin'?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That won't happen to us. I'm certain we're fully capable of solving this mystery.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Everyone sayin' that it'd be heaven on earth to live with Yuka-tan and Kirijo-senpai have no idea what it's really like.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, what are you trying to say here? What's it "really like," huh?   
   
Ken Amada   
Yukari-san and Mitsuru-san are both really aggress— Uh, strong.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm glad I've broken in these boots. They're comfortable to walk in while exploring.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I predict we are nearly finished exploring this area.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Are we nearly done exploring this area...?   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Is it my imagination or do some Shadows seem smaller than others?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
When you're stronger than your opponent, it's normal for them to appear smaller to you.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
On rainy days, I always have to warm up first. Otherwise, my old injuries start to ache.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I've heard of that before... I wonder if it's because of a drop in barometric pressure.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Wow, you sounded pretty cool just now, like someone in a manga.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
This place... I believe it violates several building codes and standards.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeah, totally. Check out how wack those stairs are— Wait, that's what bothers you!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hm... Now that you've pointed it out, I think you're right.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I think... this place violates some building codes and standards.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeah, totally. Check out how wack those stairs are— Wait, that's what bothers you!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hm... Now that you've pointed it out, I think you're right.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I'm on a diet right now, but I've been eating way too much lately... I need to get some exercise in.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I feel like... this is the nth time you've said that.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Being well-equipped is a factor of combat effectiveness. Make sure to check your gear regularly.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We can buy equipment at the police station, right? And there's a chance of finding some here, too.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Even when facing an unknown enemy, staying calm ensures the quickest path to victory.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's important to have a good weapon, but you also need to consider protective gear.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It looks like the layout of this floor won't change, regardless of what day it is.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's similar to the entrance, then. To think there'd be this type of floor here and there...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
If only every floor was like this. Climbing is hard enough as it is.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Are you telling me to do my best? Okay, I will!   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Whenever we return from Tartarus, do you ever have trouble falling asleep despite feeling exhausted?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Not me. I'm dead asleep the moment my head hits the pillow...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Whenever that happens, brew a cup of herbal tea. It may help relieve your anxiety.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
It has been some time since my last battle, but there are no issues to report.   
   
Aigis   
Let's press forward. You can leave all the fighting to me.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
The scenery changed... Those Shadows lurking around might be different, too.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The décor has completely changed. Now then, what are we going to find...   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The atmosphere here has changed drastically... Please be careful, everyone.   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
You probably don't need to hear this, but... don't be stupid. You never know what'll happen here.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Okay, um... You're actually worried about us, aren't you?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Y-You got it, Senpai! Thanks for lookin' out for us!   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Just when I thought we didn't have to deal with the creepy faces anymore... it gets weirder.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I bet the scenery here serves as a distraction. Well, it won't work.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
This place is incredible... It's like a three-dimensional labyrinth.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
This is where you come in. Sorry if you feel pressured, but we'll be relying on your support.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It's so hard to tell where to go... My head's killing me.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Nothing shall escape my watch—not a Shadow, not even a tiny insect.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Okay, then if I find any bugs in my room, I'll give you a shout, Aigis...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Wow, Aigis is so focused... I'll try to keep up with her.   
   
------   
   
Aigis

Yukari Takeba

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Wow, Aigis is so focused... I'll try to keep up with her.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I have to study hard, too... It'd be so embarrassing if I get low grades.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's like this world has trapped us in a trompe l'oeil painting—like it's one big illusion.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeah, no kidding. My head hurts when I try looking from far away...   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I wonder if it's possible to teleport outside of Tartarus...   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Make sure to get some sleep. Your body needs time to recover.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...You should listen to Akihiko. He has a point—this time.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Time flies by so fast though, and before you know it, it's gotten super late...   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Do you think this layout has some sort of purpose?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I have no idea. No use thinking about it though.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Y'know what...? I think my room's all messed up like this, too.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
By using an Evoker to envision death, one may summon a Persona... What a fascinating concept.   
   
   
   
Aigis

------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Have you gotten used to dorm life? Took me a while to adjust, too...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I think I've settled in. It's certainly more relaxing to be at the dorm than at my parents' house.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh? Yuka-tan, you're actually a sensitive soul, huh? U-Uh... Please stop glaring at me!   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Moving around so much on this hard floor wears out my shoes so quickly...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Isn't that because you're always runnin', even outside of Tartarus, Sanada-san?   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
This place is just as mystifying as a trompe l'oeil painting. Koro-chan seems to be curious, too.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It's kinda scary when things are going too well...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's all right if you want to loosen up, but try not to be complacent.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Does the labyrinth keep changing for some purpose...?   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
"During the Dark Hour, we will show no mercy and... kick some Shadow ass." I learned that haiku from Junpei-san.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
There he goes again, teaching Aigis more useless stuff...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Aight, here's another one: "Freakin' Tartarus. A convenience store would be... really nice right now!"   
   
------   
   
Aigis

Akihiko Sanada   
There's no surefire way to win a fight. It depends on practice and experience.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Apparently, the drug store has sales on certain days. That's a good time to buy in bulk.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...Kind of surprised you're so practical. I guess you're not so different from us, after all.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
If we ever got lost here... I'm afraid we'd never find our way out.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I'm sure you won't let that happen. You got this, girl!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, god... Now I can't stop thinking about it...   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I think about how I should fight in my head... but it's a lot harder to pull off in practice.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Once you've experienced the thrill of taking on a powerful opponent, you'll never forget it.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I have to get stronger, too... I have to be a better support for the team!   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
In the interest of everyone's safety, I will initiate contact with the enemy.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Not so fast. How about we compete and see who can engage the enemy first?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
While I commend your bravery, I'm not one to have someone fight my own battles.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
In order to keep everyone safe, I'll be the one to initiate contact with the enemy.   
   
Akihiko Sanada

Mitsuru Kirijo   
While I commend your bravery, I'm not one to have someone fight my own battles.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
What even is this so-called "potential"? Like, it's only ever useful here.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I suppose we don't need that motorcycle with the communication equipment anymore.   
   
Junpei Iori   
That bike sure is cool though... Maybe I should get a license.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Now that those giant faces on the walls are gone, it's not as scary... is it?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeah, guess so... But I kinda miss 'em. Uh, just a little bit.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Y-Yeah? I guess so...? Haha...   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I wonder if Shadows are also capable of feeling emotions...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Who knows? But even if they did feel somethin', I doubt I could ever be friends with 'em.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Huh? Didn't we just pass this area earlier? Ugh, it's so confusing it's getting on my nerves.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
There's a lot going on, even in my personal life, but right now, exploring the tower is my top priority.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Leave the front lines to me. I will take down our enemies with a volley fire!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sorry, but it won't be that easy. I'll be taking my fair share of the action.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Let me take care of the front lines. I'll take down anything in our way!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sorry, but it won't be that easy. I'll be taking my fair share of the action.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
You know, for heroes who are trying to save the world, what we do is actually pretty lame...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I don't know what you were imagining, but this is plenty chaotic for me...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We can't exactly show any of this to the public. Besides, we're the only ones who can do our job.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
There's still so much we don't know about the Shadows... Let's hope we don't encounter an abnormal one.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeah, we've got no clue what they're thinking... Uh, assuming they think at all.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You're currently on the 80th floor. No building in this country has that many floors!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I don't like the idea that this tower has broken some kind of record.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I bet the city lights look fantastic from way up here— Oh wait, there's no working electricity.   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...I came here to help, not to pal around with you guys. Just do your own thing.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...Well, you heard him, Arisato. Don't take it personally, he's always been like that.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
...I'm not tired. I'm not a wimp. I can handle something like this, easy.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Don't burn yourself out. We all need to take a breather sometimes, too.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
S-E-E-S... The matching armbands help unify us as a team.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
S-E-E-S... These matching armbands help us feel unified as a team.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sometimes, it might be difficult to hit a Shadow's weakness. When that happens, you'll need a backup plan.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Even if there's no obvious weakness to exploit, certain attacks may still work well.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Against a group of enemies, you can take them out one by one... or target the weakest link first.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We're certainly making progress... But I'm sure this is far from over.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I've been in good form at archery practice lately. Maybe because I have experience fighting now?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
My sword skills got a mad upgrade, don'tcha think?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, yeah, I hear you... Actually, I think you did get a lot better.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's a unique sword style, certainly, but it truly reflects your personality.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Fighting in the ring is fine, but what really gets my blood pumping... is being here.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I knew it... The higher we go, the stronger the Shadows get.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, makes sense... I guess we just have to get stronger, too.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Just how much tougher can they get...? Heh, now I'm itching for a good fight.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Woof!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Huh? You want to go even higher?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
...Man, I'm beat. I stayed up late playing games last night.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I left you in charge of our supplies, Arisato... And you've done a fine job.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Thanks for all you've done. If there's anything I can do to help, just let me know.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I am equipped with several firearms. For example, I can destroy my target with a single finger. Bang.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Eugh, I've been hit! Wait, hold up, watch where you point that thing, Ai-chan!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I can only imagine how intricate your design must be. I wish I could take a look one day...   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
My body is outfitted with various firearms. I could even defeat my enemies with just one finger. Bang.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Eugh, I've been hit! Wait, hold up, watch where you point that thing, Ai-chan!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I can only imagine how intricate your design must be. I wish I could take a look one day...   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
The Dark Hour is just full of unsolved mysteries, isn't it...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Research is underway... but there's no doubt that the answer we seek is within Tartarus.   
   
Junpei Iori   
That's why we're here, right? Junpei, Ace Detective, will definitely crack this case!   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If you feel like the last fight was tough, that's a sign you need to slow down and build your strength.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You never know where the Shadows may be lurking. Stay on your guard.   
   
Aigis   
Roger that. We shall be on the lookout for enemy ambushes.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Arrows are a single-use item, so I end up spending a surprising amount of money on them.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If we're avoiding enemies going forward, take care they don't ambush us from behind.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Ugh, Shadows are so annoying. Why can't they just leave us alone?   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Everyone, please monitor your energy levels, or else you'll be "out like a light," as they say.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Y'know, Ai-chan, you have a very, uh... unique way of talkin'.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Everyone, please pay close attention to your energy levels, or else you'll be out like a light.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Y'know, Ai-chan, you have a very, uh... unique way of talkin'.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Awww yeah, I'm in top form today! No, wait, I'm always in top form!   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The atmosphere here is so different compared to the beginning.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
What is everyone's nighttime routine after we return from exploring Tartarus?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I have a protein drink and do some stretches. You need to take proper care of your muscles post-workout.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I usually take a shower and head straight to bed. Staying up late is bad for your skin, you know.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I've been wondering... What does everyone do after we return from exploring Tartarus?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I have a protein drink and do some stretches. You need to take proper care of your muscles post-workout.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I usually take a shower and head straight to bed. Staying up late is bad for your skin, you know.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I've heard that, during the Sengoku era, many warlords used spears, too.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The spear is said to be one of the earliest weapons in human history. It is truly a refined weapon.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I forgot my gym uniform the other day, so I borrowed Fuuka's. She's a lifesaver.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm glad to be of help! Was the size okay?   
   
Junpei Iori   
The next time you forget, I can lend you mine— Whuh? You don't need it?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
At this pace, I can run just about anywhere. How high up are we going tonight?   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The 88th floor... It sounds like we've made a lot of progress, but I get the feeling we still have a long way to go.   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
I still got plenty of fight left in me... Just say the word, and I'll raise hell.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
I was thinking, the teachers at our school are, uh... really something else, aren't they?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Cooling down after a workout is a great way to speed up your recovery.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I will fight at full power on the front lines. You won't be disappointed.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yes, your prowess is second to none. I look forward to seeing you in action.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Since I'm on the front lines, I'll fight with all of my strength. Full throttle!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yes, your prowess is second to none. I look forward to seeing you in action.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Awoooo!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hehe, you're full of energy, aren't you?   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*sniff* *sniff*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan is sniffing around. I wonder if he's wary about something in this area.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Ooh, didja find us some buried treasure or somethin'?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'd say my skills have leveled up since spring, but they're still nowhere good enough.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Woof!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You're such a smart boy, Koro-chan. You follow all our instructions to the letter, huh.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I'm so sweaty... I can't wait to take a shower and change out of these clothes.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I don't detect any Shadows here.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Senpai's family must be crazy influential if they were able to develop Aigis...   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
It gets pretty boring just waiting downstairs... Too bad we can't play any video games either.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The more our team grows, the harder it gets to decide who's on the front lines.   
   
Aigis   
Having been selected for the advance team, I will do my utmost to contribute to this mission.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You know, I never imagined Koro-chan would end up joining our team.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Pretty sure nobody saw it comin'. But hey, the more, the merrier, right?   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I guess Koro-chan doesn't need a leash or anything.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Ai-chan is cute, strong, and a robot. That's way overkill.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
As the leader, it's up to you to figure out where our new teammates shine best, Arisato.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Agreed. I have high hopes for you, Arisato.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Exploration is all about planning, execution, and adaptation. It's similar to working a job or doing schoolwork.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Our energy reserves are not easily replenished. Please manage our resources accordingly.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, good point. We can't exactly restock our supplies in Tartarus.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
None of us have an infinite reserve of energy. Please manage our resources carefully.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, good point. We can't exactly restock our supplies in Tartarus.   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
You can look after yourself. Just focus on what you gotta do.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You're such a smart boy, aren't you, Koromaru? You can even wield a weapon on your own!   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We've gotten more manpower now, but I can't afford to take it easy.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm keeping track of enemy weaknesses, so feel free to ask me anything anytime.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*whine*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I think that floor is too slippery for Koro-chan.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey... You get around, don't you? You should totally introduce me to a cute girl one day.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If you want to get the most protein out of a meal, a beef bowl from Umiushi is the way to go.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Though the décor has yet to change, we have reached the 96th floor. Let us press forward.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Though our surroundings look the same as ever, we're currently on the 96th floor. Let's keep it up.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
Is everyone getting enough sleep...? Oh, I'm fine though—just asking.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hehe, that's good to hear. Just don't push yourself too hard, okay?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
This may sound hypocritical, considering we asked you to join us, but... don't push yourself too hard.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Even if we get stronger, so do our enemies... In the end, fighting is just as hard.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Apparently, there's an antique shop in Paulownia Mall. I can't place why, but... the shopkeeper looks familiar.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I have a plentiful reserve of ammunition. You may rest assured; I will not run out of firepower.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I have plenty of ammunition in reserve, so I won't be running out of bullets any time soon.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Even though some Shadows look similar, they have totally different fighting styles and strengths.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
I'mma eat some instant ramen when we get back! The question is, what flavor? Shoyu, salt, curry...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, stop already! Now I'm getting hungry!   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Don't swing your sword around at random. You have to get into a rhythm.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It's so nice to have a team this big. I feel more secure with a lot of people here on standby.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, I can imagine how lonely it gets at the entrance... and how scary it'd be if a Shadow wandered in.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Can you hang on for a bit longer, Koro-chan?   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...Don't worry, I can still fight. All this walking's just killin' my feet.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Ha, trust me, I wasn't worried in the first place. I'm the one trying to keep up with you.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Heh, if you say so. I better not hear you whining about how exhausted you are later on.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
So we've reached the 99th floor... The number is hardly significant, but we've certainly come a long way.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Heh, I'mma be the first one to reach the next floor!   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Were I able to travel at lightspeed, I could reach the top instantly...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Unfortunately, that'd be difficult to implement with our current technology...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'd rather not take the easy way out. I'll get to the top on my own two feet.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I wish I could travel at lightspeed. At least then, I could reach the top instantly...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Unfortunately, that'd be difficult to implement with our current technology...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'd rather not take the easy way out. I'll get to the top on my own two feet.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We've finally reached the 100th floor... I wonder how much further we have to go.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Awww yeah, we finally hit the big leagues! But I guess this ain't the right time to party...   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We've reached the 100th floor... I guess that counts as some sort of milestone.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There's no building this tall in reality, is there?   
   
Aigis   
...The exact height of this structure is unknown, but there are no matches found in my database.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Even if there was, I'd never go check it out. It'd only remind me of this place...   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Tadaaa. We have arrived at the 100th floor.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If only this were the end. Unfortunately, it looks like we have more ground to cover. Let's stay focused.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Ta-dah da-daah! Guess we hit a major milestone, huh?   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Tadaaaa. We've reached the 100th floor.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If only this were the end. Unfortunately, it looks like we have more ground to cover. Let's stay focused.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Ta-dah da-daah! Guess we hit a major milestone, huh?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
101st floor! Look alive, folks! Let's treat this like a fresh start!   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Are we almost there? Or only halfway? Or are we nowhere close? Well... Guess we'll find out.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Just wondering... How many different types of Shadows do you think there are?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We've seen a bunch already. It'd be a pain to count them all...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
There are probably a few categories of Shadows, but I couldn't tell you how many there are in total.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Looks like you're still full of energy, but don't exhaust yourself, okay?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Whew... Seems like a good time for a break.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Huh!? Weren't you really motivated just now...?   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I suppose, since we're using both body and mind in battle, it's only natural to feel fatigued...   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
There appears to be no end to the Shadows... All I can do is eliminate them on sight.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
It's as if... there's no end to the Shadows. All I can do is eliminate them on sight.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
My bangs are getting a little long... Gotta schedule a hair appointment.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh, really? Looks the same to me...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I want to try growing out my hair... But I'm worried about it getting in my face.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We've got a long climb ahead of us. Normally, we'd need to bulk up for this expedition.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
No need to tell me twice. I've been training and eating plenty of protein.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, in that case, I say we get sushi—! What, no bueno?   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
The Shadows are getting stronger. We cannot allow ourselves to be defeated.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, we're getting stronger, too. I mean, the heroes always win, right? That's just how it is.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It would be for the best if we could overcome the obstacles in our path with ease.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
The Shadows are getting stronger. We can't allow ourselves to be defeated.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, we're getting stronger, too. I mean, the heroes always win, right? That's just how it is.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It would be for the best if we could overcome the obstacles in our path with ease.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I need to get even stronger...   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It'd be nice if we could go on another trip, don't you think? How about going abroad next time?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Man, it'd be nice if there was like... some kinda switch you can flip to get motivated.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'm surprised Kurosawa-san has weapons stocked for Aigis, too. That's impressive.   
   
Junpei Iori   
The guy has one scary mug, but he's a real big help, huh?   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
...Achoo! E-Excuse me!   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan looks like he's feeling hot... I hear dogs don't have many sweat glands.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Don't mistake recklessness for bravery. Best keep that in mind.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What a surprise... I never thought I'd hear Akihiko say that himself.   
   
Junpei Iori   
You hear that, Minato? If things are startin' to look dicey, you can always run away.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
We should not exhaust our bodies. I recommend taking time for a cooldown when necessary.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Cooling down, huh... Now I'm craving some ice cream.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Aigis has a point. Don't act recklessly out there, okay?   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
We should avoid exhausting our bodies. When necessary, let's take the time to cool down.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Cooling down, huh... Well, now I'm craving some ice cream.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Aigis has a point. Don't act recklessly out there, okay?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You gotta use your head in a fight. Always think one step ahead of your opponent.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...Did you get that, Junpei?   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
This labyrinth is beyond reason... Is there even some kind of logic behind it?   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Being able to carry multiple Personas... I never thought it possible.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's pretty unbelievable. I definitely can't see myself with more than one.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
And not once has he let that power go to his head. That's our leader—always calm, ever reliable.   
   
------   
   
Aigis

------   
   
Koromaru   
Woof!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Don't worry, I'm watching over you from here. You can proceed at your own pace.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Somehow, I always end up choosing things that are pink over any other color.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It has to be red for me. A brilliant red always helps me get fired up.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Pink really suits you though, Yukari-chan.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'd rather not rely only on my Persona in a fight. I need to work on my close combat.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Shadows sometimes hide in areas that are hard to see, so keep an eye out for surprise attacks.   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Nothing wrong with gettin' stronger. If you're gonna train, I'll join you.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh crap, I forgot to do my homework... Why'd I have to remember now?   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'd like to ask you all to get enough sleep... But I understand this situation doesn't allow for it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You don't need to worry about me. I know what I'm getting myself into.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It's not like we're going every single day, so it's fine. I think I actually sleep better when I'm tired.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Apparently, all of you have something called a "blood type." What would my type be?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, I dunno about your type, Ai-chan, but you're definitely my type! Ahaha, get it?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Huh? Um, good question... I guess it might depend on the kind of oil you use?   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Apparently, all of you have something called a "blood type." I wonder what my type would be...   
   
Junpei Iori

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Huh? Um, good question... I guess it might depend on the kind of oil you use?   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sometimes it's important to fake it till you make it, at least to get into the right mindset.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You know, there's a downside to wearing gloves and brass knuckles... I can't scratch an itch on my hands.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
Even if the enemy looks weak, we can't let our guard down.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
They say a cornered animal is the most dangerous. We can't have them take us by surprise.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Woof.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan can remain calm even inside Tartarus.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
...I forgot that I have to record a TV show to watch later.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We've made so much progress compared to the time I first set foot in here... It feels like a dream.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Aside from the height... if this tower is our school, does that mean it can only be as wide as the campus?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I can't say for sure... But, unfortunately, I don't think it works that way.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I doubt it... Just look at this place. It's ridiculous. Neither logic nor reason apply here.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
If I could install new hardware, what would be most optimal for our team?   
   
Ken Amada   
Um, maybe a ray gun that shoots laser beams or— Uh, n-never mind!   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I wonder if I should install some new hardware... Does anyone have any requests?   
   
Ken Amada   
Um, maybe a ray gun that shoots laser beams or— Uh, n-never mind!   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Doesn't the water pressure in the dorms' showers get pretty weak sometimes?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeah, yeah! And it'll randomly get super hot, too.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Please report any problem with the facilities to me. I'll let the person in charge know.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Tartarus has to end somewhere, right...?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeah, we'll reach the top, and it'll all be over... someday? Maybe? Hopefully?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Well, there's the top of the tower, but who knows if we'll even get there...?   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
We just gotta crush anything standin' in our way, then move on with our lives.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Damn, what a badass... Is he seriously just a year older than us?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Ha, well, I'm certainly glad you're on our side. You'll have plenty of opportunities to let loose.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Oh, right, I ran out of protein powder... I guess I'll go stock up tomorrow.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Whenever I take a break, I find myself missing the aroma of black tea.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You always look so elegant and sophisticated drinking tea, Kirijo-senpai.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I'm pretty big on Mad Bull! Nothin' beats crackin' one open after soakin' in the tub.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
The concept of sleep is so strange to me. Do you have dreams when you sleep?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Well, I think we see all kinds of stuff, but we don't really remember any of it when we wake up.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yep! In mine, I'm a superhero who's a hit with the ladies! But I always wake up when it gets good...   
   
------   
   
Aigis

Yep! In mine, I'm a superhero who's a hit with the ladies! But I always wake up when it gets good...   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I think I'm slowly but surely getting used to this place.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Well, aren't you in a good mood, Koro-chan? Are you happy to be here with everyone?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
It'd be pretty fun to have a training camp as part of our "club activities," yeah?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If you want your body to look toned, don't skimp on your diet. You gotta build muscle.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I do hear that a lot, but it's so much work...   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I just noticed the temperature and air pressure inside Tartarus aren't too different from reality.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Perhaps that's one way to lure people inside...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, at least we ain't breathin' in poison gas or somethin'...   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Even though I know it's a Shadow, it's hard to confront them if they look like a person...   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
It just hit me... We don't know what Shadows eat. Do they even get hungry?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I have no idea, so let's just be careful we don't end up as their fodder.   
   
Aigis   
There is no data on whether or not they have an "appetite" as humans do.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It's hard to get a read on the layout here. Keep your guard up.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
The same scenery seems to go on forever and ever... We better be careful not to get lost.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
In times like this, I'm real glad we have Fuuka with us.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*sniff* *sniff*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I wonder if Koro-chan's sense of smell is more reliable than his sight.   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
I got your back. Just focus on being the leader.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I'd love to try a bunch of different weapons, but there's a limit to how much money I can spend...   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
This is a pretty good lineup you've got here... Nice work, Arisato.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If our work here has impacted anyone's personal or school life, I'll do what I can to help.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Awooooo!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, um... What's wrong, Koro-chan?   
   
Ken Amada   
What's wrong, Koromaru? Are you calling for Fuuka-san...?   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
I'll never forget this feeling...   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Don't your bangs get in the way? You should just shave it all off, like me!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Your hairstyle says a lot about your personality, right? It'd be a bold move to change it up.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If your hair were as short as Iori's, it'd dry more quickly, too.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Okay, we've gone past the checkpoint. What's next?   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Perhaps you could adjust your lineup to target the enemies' weaknesses on the current floor.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
My Persona is an offensive type that specializes in dealing physical damage to the enemy.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It's interesting how everyone has such unique, distinct Personas, isn't it?   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
My Persona excels in dealing physical damage to the enemy.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It's interesting how everyone has such unique, distinct Personas, isn't it?   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I need to get a better grasp of my power...   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Only an idiot tries to act tough. Better to be smart and know when to quit.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Nobody would ever believe that the school turns into this sort of place...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Yeah... In the beginning, I had no clue what was happening.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
These teleporters... They allow us to start from here the next time we explore.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It'd suck if we had to climb up the tower without them.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
With a teleporter, the next time we explore, we can start from here...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It'd suck if we had to climb up the tower without them.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Wow, this area sort of looks like... some golden ruins?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Haha, feels like we're in a movie! You know, the ones like "Find the hidden treasure!" or something.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
How crazy rich do you have to be to build something like this?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I can't afford to screw up. Not when he's watching.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Don't be fooled by the display of opulence... This is still a twisted and terrible place.   
   
Junpei Iori   
You think so...? Well, I guess there are Shadows lurkin' 'round here.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It seems like we've reached the end of the block. The scenery here looks so different...   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
This place appears so otherworldly... And somewhat distorted. It is a truly mysterious place.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
This place appears so otherworldly... And somewhat distorted. What a mysterious place.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
Don't go easy on me just because I'm a kid. I can hold my own in a fight.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You're really mature for your age, unlike someone else we know.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It is surprising, isn't it? I'm sure nobody expected the floor to look so different.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh! Even I could tell that was a bark of surprise just now!   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Ain't this place fancy... Doesn't change the fact it's still tacky though.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
You're always out on the front lines. Don't you get tired?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All right, let's keep moving. My fists are aching for some action.   
   
Junpei Iori   
You look real fired up, Senpai. Did somethin' good happen?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You're always so energetic, Sanada-senpai. Your daily workout routine must be real intense.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The flora here is thriving despite the lack of sunlight... That just goes to show how everything here is fake.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If everything really is an illusion, then we just have to tear it all down.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
What on earth has the power to create a place like this?   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Woof!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Don't drink from the waterfall, okay? We can't be sure that it's safe...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Haha, what, you wanna go for a swim? Better not do that here, but at home, aight?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
If you ever find yourself backed in a corner, just holler. I'll be your pinch hitter!   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Arisato, though this is a heavy burden to bear, you are the best suited for this role.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Easy for you to say... It's a demanding job, you know?   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Everything here is so shiny... It's making me a little disoriented.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I am starting to get used to life at school. Next, I would like to try eating lunch during class.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Where on earth did you get that sort of idea?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
But, Aigis, you can't really eat lunch. Maybe you could get an oil change instead...?   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I'm starting to get used to school life. Next, I'd like to try eating lunch during class.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Where on earth did you get that sort of idea?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
But, Aigis, you can't really eat lunch. Maybe you could get an oil change instead...?   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
This place kinda looks like... some sort of ruins. I hope there aren't any hidden traps here.   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
You're doin' good... Just don't get too gung-ho and start runnin' ahead.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It must be hard to be the leader... So I'll do everything I can to help you out!   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We might encounter some new enemies again, so let's look lively when the time comes!   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Don't forget to hydrate. If you're slowing down, then you didn't drink enough water.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, the rest of the archery team tells me the same thing—to drink water regularly.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Aigis can handle herself in combat, but... do try and look after her at school.   
   
Aigis   
I do not think I will have an issue adapting, but if any problems arise, I will come to you.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh yeah... Wasn't there a movie where the main characters go treasure hunting in a place like this?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeeep... And there's usually a bunch of nasty traps all over the place.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It'd be nice if we could find some kinda hidden treasure, even though that's not why we're here.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
The Dark Hour, huh... I don't think anyone in my class would believe me if I told them about it.   
   
Junpei Iori   
After midnight, you're fast asleep inside a coffin... Yeah, that's a real hard sell.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I don't think I'll lose... But it's probably not a good thing to be overconfident, right?   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Between the advance team and the reserves, our ranks have grown considerably.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, to think we used to be a team of three newbies.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It's great to see that the dorm has gotten even livelier, too.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Why are students required to wear uniforms? Everyone appears to come from the same series.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
For various reasons. You could say they maintain discipline and symbolize learning.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Well, a lot of people like to jazz up school uniforms by adding a little flair, like me.   
   
------   
   
Aigis

------   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Is it too hot there? Maybe we should trim Koro-chan's fur.   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
I'm trash at support, but if somethin' needs a beatin', then I'm your man.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, how do you feel about a team with just me, Yuka-tan, Kirijo-senpai, and Ai-chan?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It sounds fairly balanced, but don't forget about me.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Is there an ulterior motive, or is it just my imagination?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Oh, my hand wraps are getting loose. Gotta fix that.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Don't tell me... All of this is made of real gold?   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
The school regulations do not say that robots cannot enroll, so I should not have problems attending class.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Ahaha... The thought probably never even crossed their minds.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
The school regulations don't say that robots can't enroll, so I shouldn't have any problems attending class.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Ahaha... The thought probably never even crossed their minds.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*whine*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan, I know it must be hot, but please try to bear with your protective gear, okay?   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...You sure you eatin' properly? You're pretty scrappy for someone so scrawny.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Shinji's right. Don't forget to maintain a balanced diet.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
It doesn't matter how strong the enemy is. I don't plan on losing.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That's the spirit. Just don't forget you can lean on your friends, too.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Having Koro-chan around always cheers me up.   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...How high is this damn tower?   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Do you ever get nervous entering another classroom? Everyone's eyes are all on you...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Once you get used to the attention, you'll hardly notice anyone staring.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Y'know, I'm actually a bit of a trendsetter myself.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hmm... Clothes are nice... but if I had to choose, I prefer a beautiful physique instead.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You do seem to enjoy accessorizing, Junpei-kun.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
How about we take a break and go out somewhere together one day?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, I know exactly where this is going... You're gonna make us run the whole way, aren'tcha?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um... I guess as long as it's nothing too intense...   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The higher we go, the tougher the Shadows get... But we've been getting even stronger as well.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There are some plants and flowing water here, but... they don't seem to be real.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Could some hidden meaning be found in the appearance of this floor?   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Could there be some hidden meaning in the appearance of this floor?   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
The enemies are getting stronger the more we progress... I need to fight even harder.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Some situations may call for a tactical retreat as well, but I'll defer to your lead, Arisato.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I got a little carried away shopping for clothes this month... My wallet is really hurting.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, I'm always hurting for cash! The Bank of Junpei is currently accepting donations!   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
You should wear a hat every once in a while. It's the first step to upgrading your wardrobe!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I can't see Junpei-kun without his trademark hat.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
An elegant hat is a must for full formal wear.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I saw a shopping channel on TV the other day, but... do you think it sells anything catering to our needs?   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Animals sometimes stare intently at nothing, don't they?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Wh-What are you looking at, Koromaru? There's nothing there, right...? Right?   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Even some small fry will maim you if they see an opening. Stay alert.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Aragaki is right. Don't forget that we're risking our lives being here.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
When night falls... I always find myself looking up at the moon to see what phase it's in.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Some enemies aren't a good matchup for me. I'll do what I can, but if you want me to tag out, I get it.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I wouldn't be surprised at all if we were forced to solve puzzles in this place...   
   
Ken Amada   
That sounds kind of fun. I wonder if I'd be able to figure them out...   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...Like in a video game?   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I'm good to go. Let's move on.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Seems like you're fitting in perfectly at school, Ai-chan!   
   
Aigis   
That is reassuring to hear. My stealth mission has been a success.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Oh no...! I think the library book I borrowed was due today...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Man, don't scare me like that! I forget to return movies to the rental place all the time!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You seem really busy, Senpai... I'd better return mine soon, too.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You know... this place kind of resembles an ancient ruin.   
   
Ken Amada   
Why would a place like this be inside of Tartarus...?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
It's so goddamn bright everywhere you look. They oughta fire the interior decorator.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Woof!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Looks like Koro-chan's trying to give us strength. We still have a long way to go, but let's keep at it!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That bark sure had a lot of spirit. We won't be outdone here!   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Tch, they're everywhere...   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I really want a new phone... Like, I'd apply to a part-time job, but I just don't have the time.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
My classmates are all studying for college entrance exams... But this is higher priority.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Though a mechanical body is more durable than most... I must avoid overheating.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I suppose there's a price to pay for all that power. But what really matters is how we use it.   
   
------   
   
Aigis

Mitsuru Kirijo

------   
   
Ken Amada   
I sure hope I'm not stepping on anyone's toes...   
   
Aigis   
There has been no problem. I would say you are a splendid team player.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I wonder what the light source for this area is... It's not sunlight, is it?   
   
Ken Amada   
I don't know... But it's as bright as day here even though it's the Dark Hour right now. Weird, right?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
I don't care what it is... It's just way too damn bright here.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I can't wait till all of this is over... Both the Dark Hour and the fighting...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I feel the same way... That's why I'd like for you to lend us your strength for a little longer.   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...Gettin' stronger is fine and all, but don't lean too much on your power.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You know, I have other interests than building muscle. Cardio and reflex training are just as important.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
This probably isn't the right time to bring this up, but... I wonder if there's any treasure buried here.   
   
Ken Amada   
Treasure!? It'd be really cool if we found some!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...Just holler if you see any.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Remember... human parts cannot be replaced. Please prioritize your own safety.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Right. Problematic injuries take a long time to heal. Avoiding them altogether takes some skill.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
When humans get hurt, they can't replace broken parts like a machine can... Please be careful.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Right. Problematic injuries take a long time to heal. Avoiding them altogether takes some skill.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Awoooo!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You've gotten so much better at handling your weapon, Koro-chan!   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
If I could work part-time, being a café waitress or something would be nice!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You'd be great at it, Yukari-chan! I think... I'd like to be a florist.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I'd rather work at a ramen joint, 'cause then I could eat all the ramen I want!   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Maybe I should get a motorcycle license... I'd love to ride like the wind with Kirijo-senpai.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Bikes are wonderful, but please prioritize your education.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We've come so far and still have a clear line of communication... Yamagishi is truly incredible.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah, that'll let us focus on the battle, too. Keep up the good work.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
The ability to use many different Personas... I can't get over how unreal that is.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
No kidding. You're seriously one of a kind, Leader. We're counting on you!   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
...Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
No matter how much Koro-chan fights, his fur stays so clean and pretty.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Even during battle, Koromaru's white coat has not once lost its shine.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Man, I really don't wanna stress over exams or job hunting... Besides, we gotta take care of business.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We have so many new teammates now. A veteran like me has to set a good example for them.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Come to think of it... Isn't it oddly convenient that there are teleporters already set up here?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Maybe the Shadows use 'em, too?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
They might be relics of the research that was conducted here... So I wouldn't necessarily call it fortunate.   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
We're already here, so I guess I might as well tag along if you're gonna train.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It'd be nice if we had a chance to regroup after a difficult battle...   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
This might be stating the obvious, but you really can't beat some enemies with sheer force alone.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
There are factors like affinities and all that jazz. But that's where our leader really shines!   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Arf?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Did Koro-chan just ask us if we're tired? I get the feeling he's concerned...   
   
Junpei Iori   
What, are you worried about us? That's real sweet of ya, Koromaru!   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
There's a mahjong parlor in the back alley of the mall. Anyone been?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hm... Maybe playing mahjong could help develop a gambler's foresight.   
   
Ken Amada   
That sounds like a very "grown-up" thing to do. Maybe I should learn how to play one day.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Try to keep your health and stamina up, just in case we run into trouble.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I saw a shopping program on TV the other day... Do you suppose they sell heavy weapons as well?   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I saw a shopping program on TV the other day... Do you think they sell heavy weapons as well?   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf! Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm arf four it— Uh, never mind.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, I just realized I forgot something at school... What are the chances it'd be lying around here?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I know we practically forced you to become the leader, but I have to say, you've done good.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yes, I agree. We really were fortunate that you joined us.   
   
Junpei Iori   
You really think so? I dunno, I feel like he spaces out a lot.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Please don't drink the flowing water there. It's unsanitary and dangerous.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Who the hell would— Actually, never mind. I know one dumbass who might...   
   
Ken Amada   
Aw, we can't? But it looks so cool and refreshing...   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
What does the moon have to do with the Shadows...?   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
We got a musclehead, a noncombatant... and a dog. You got your work cut out for you, Leader.   
   
Koromaru   
Woof!   
   
Junpei Iori   
You sure do! Uh... You didn't forget about me, didja?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
There's a rumor goin' around about Ms. Toriumi. Apparently, she plays a lot of games.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Huh, I never would've guessed. I wonder what kind of games she plays.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Do we keep going or turn back? It's a tough call...   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
This is the 139th floor... I think that's about 550 meters high.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Damn, that's tall... Not that it means anything here.   
   
Ken Amada   
Wh-Whoa... So we're pretty high up, huh.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sometimes Koro-chan gives us a meaningful gaze, like he's trying to tell us something.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
They say the eyes speak louder than words ever could... Perhaps there's meaning behind that gaze.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I wonder if there are people who travel from far away just to go to Paulownia Mall.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The 140th floor... I never thought Tartarus would be the tallest building in this country.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I have a joke. What is the difference between Amada-san and Koromaru-san?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Amada-kun wears shorts, and Koromaru pants... Wait, Aigis, did Ikutsuki-san rub off on you!?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, I know! Amada wears shorts, and Koromaru pants! Nice one, Ai-chan!   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Would you all like to hear a funny joke? What is the difference between Amada-san and Koromaru-san?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Amada-kun wears shorts, and Koromaru pants... Wait, Aigis, did Ikutsuki-san rub off on you!?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, I know! Amada wears shorts, and Koromaru pants! Nice one, Ai-chan!   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I didn't realize we were already so high up...   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Sure wasn't as rowdy back when it was just us three...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Well, a lot has changed—for Akihiko and me, and... for you as well.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well, yeah, but... I think I prefer it this way. Don't you?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
I haven't been getting enough shuteye... I'm gonna doze off in class again.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
What's new...? I'm the one getting tired from firing shots at you.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
How about taking a nap? Even just ten minutes can make you feel refreshed.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm sure even a member of the track team would find it difficult to run all the way up here...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah, this is the perfect place for us to train.   
   
Junpei Iori   
If there was ever a stair-climbin' contest, d'ya think one of us would come out on top?   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
This place kind of looks like an ornate tomb for a mummy...   
   
Ken Amada   
A m-mummy!? Th-There's no way we're gonna run into one here, right...?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...At least a mummy's already dead. Doubt it'd come after us.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Why do people willingly wait in a long queue to eat? There are faster ways to acquire nutrition.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hm... I guess eating something that tastes good makes them happy.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Eating isn't just about consuming nutrients. It's also about enjoying the taste... I think.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Why would people rather wait in long lines to eat at a restaurant? There are faster ways to get food.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hm... I guess eating something that tastes good makes them happy.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Eating isn't just about consuming nutrients. It's also about enjoying the taste... I think.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Amada-kun, are you feeling tired? Don't force yourself to keep up, okay...?   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The same scenery seems to stretch forever on this path, but I'm here to support everyone!   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Why don't we rent a DVD and have ourselves a movie night?   
   
Ken Amada   
That'd be nice! I wanna watch a superhe— Uh, never mind...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Alright, then you choose the movie, Minato! And we can't forget the popcorn!   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yo, I was top dog in class after a test! Well, in a dream I had the other night.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...I'm glad it was just a dream, 'cause you'd just rub it in our faces if it actually happened.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Heehee, I hope your dream comes true.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Maybe I'll head somewhere over the weekend to train.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sounds like it'll be a long trip. I bet it'd be cool to train alone in the mountains.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I feel nothing but overwhelming disgust at the sight of all this glitter and gold...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeah, no kidding. I was pretty excited at first, but now it just hurts my eyes, man...   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Even though it looks so lavish and extravagant here... at the same time, it feels so empty.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I am interested in partaking in an extracurricular activity. Do you have any recommendations?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Do you wanna join the archery team? I think you'd look good wearing a hakama, Aigis.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I would suggest the boxing team, but, uh... that might be a bad idea, considering your mechanical body.   
   
------   
   
Aigis

------   
   
Koromaru   
*sniff* *sniff*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan seems to be on high alert. I'll keep an eye out, too.   
   
------   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
No matter what happens... Always expect the unexpected.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
...I have to do it.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan seems to be very calm. He looks so dignified right now.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Koromaru's one friendly dog, ain't he? I bet he could become king of the jungle or somethin'.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...There's no more turning back. This marks a fresh start for me.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
...Do you really think we'll be able to get rid of Tartarus?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We have to. We're the only ones who can.   
   
Ken Amada   
If we all work together, I know we can!   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I am aware that this is a very dangerous mission, so I will do everything in my power to protect you.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I'm aware that we're on a very dangerous mission. That's why I'll do whatever I can to protect you.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I won't run... Not anymore. I'll stand my ground and fight with you all.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If that's the choice you've made, I have no objections... I'm sure he'd say the same thing, too.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I left a magazine in the lounge, and the next thing I know, it's gone... Did someone take it?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, my bad... The cover girl was just so cute I took it with me and looked through the whole thing!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I think it was Junpei-kun... He said that the model on the front cover was cute.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
...When you're washing your hair, do you sometimes feel someone staring at your back?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Don't you start with that "Believe It, or Don't" schtick, or I'm gonna snap.   
   
Koromaru   
*whine*   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Please be on the lookout for any nearby Shadows.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Understood. We'll remain vigilant. After all, our enemies are getting stronger as well.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Man, the Shadows just keep comin', and Tartarus just keeps goin' and goin'...   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*whine*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Come to think of it, Aragaki-senpai was usually the one feeding Koro-chan...   
   
Aigis   
Aragaki-san used to take him out for walks rather often.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Where does the water from a waterfall flow? I guess there's no end to a person's curiosity.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Alrighty... Let's go kick some ass!   
   
Ken Amada   
Yeah, there's no way we can give up here.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I never would've expected a nest of Shadows to look like this.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
"Dying" is not the same as how a machine like me would "break down," is it...?   
   
Ken Amada   
......   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
"Dying" is not the same as a machine "breaking down." I'm starting to understand that now...   
   
Ken Amada   
......   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I'm sorry about the other day. I didn't mean to make everyone worried, and, um... thank you.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All that matters is that you came back safe and sound. You left without permission, but I'll let it slide.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I dunno why, but I kinda like how the bell sounds in an empty classroom after school.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeah, I feel you. It has this kinda... sad vibe, doesn't it?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
My mind is set now. I'm just going to do whatever I can.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I wonder... Is the Reaper usually hiding somewhere, biding its time?   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf...!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It feels like he just told me to hang in there... Koro-chan, you're so strong.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Who's next? It doesn't matter what I'm up against, I'm gonna come out on top.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If only cars were operational here... It would've made exploring so much easier.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, I used to think the same thing... But then I realized there's just too many stairs.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Even if we could drive around here, the car would probably get stuck somewhere.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
...Let us continue moving upwards. We cannot afford to idle here.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
...Let's keep going up. There's no time to waste.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
Have I gotten just a little bit stronger...?   
   
Junpei Iori   
By the looks of it, I'd say so, yeah. You got nothin' on me though!   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
The pharmacy at Paulownia Mall has some really unique things for sale, huh?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
...It's about time for our regularly scheduled full moon and tests, huh?   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm only average when it comes to swordplay, so I hadn't expected my skills to serve me well here.   
   
Junpei Iori   
"Swordplay"...? Oh, you mean "fencing"! Uh, pretty sure you're way above average...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Now that you mention it, I sure am glad I took archery seriously.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Looking at how this tower was built, it's as if someone designed it this way...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I see your point... If there is such a designer, I'd like to ask them why this place exists.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, no way it looks like this by chance... But honestly, I have no clue.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
The sight of flowing water reminds me of Yakushima.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh boy, do I remember the day we met you! For more reasons than one...   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
The sight of flowing water reminds me of Yakushima. How nostalgic...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh boy, do I remember the day we met you! For more reasons than one...   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
Would you say it's childish to like hero shows...? Not that I do! Just wondering, is all!   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Right now, all I can do is empty my head and swing my fists at the opponent.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It's kinda the same thing in archery. You'll never hit your target if you think too much about it.   
   
Aigis   
In other words... the Braindead Strategy, or BS.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Whenever I look at Koro-chan, I feel like I can do anything and everything.   
   
Ken Amada   
It's really encouraging to see how Koromaru is always so cheerful.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, Arisato-kun, have you ever been to a club? Isn't it kinda scary to walk into one?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
...Actually, could you use the Kirijo Group's power to make some magic happen with our grades?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Your time would be better spent on studying than negotiating with me.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I wonder if this scenery somehow correlates with the heavy Shadow presence here...   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I saw a celebrity at Paulownia Mall. He was the executive producer of a TV shopping program that airs on Sundays.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Seriously? Uh, what's his name again? President Tanaka? Actually, ain't he kinda sleazy...?   
   
Ken Amada   
The only TV show I watch on Sundays is Featherma— Uh, n-never mind.   
   
------

------   
   
Ken Amada   
Just when am I going to grow taller...?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Maybe you should try drinking more milk... But I guess you've heard that before.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Just eat and sleep, and it'll happen one way or another! I'm a growing boy, too, y'know!   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I'd like to take a romantic bike ride to school with someone, someday... But I guess we'd get into trouble for sharing one bike.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
They say you can't fight on an empty stomach, but hunger can also sharpen your senses.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, I get it. Like how you can smell instant ramen while it's cookin'— Wait, that's not what you meant?   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Try to open as many chests as you can. I'm sure there'll be all kinds of useful items inside.   
   
Junpei Iori   
You got it! Time to go treasure huntin'!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I wonder who's been placing them here... assuming it's on purpose.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
Lately, I feel like I can understand Koromaru's feelings every now and then.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*sniff* *sniff*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The odor here seems to be bothering Koro-chan. I wonder what smells...   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
You know, whenever I plan on studying, it just so happens to be a day we come out here!   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If El Dorado were ever real, perhaps it would look like this.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
El Dorado, the lost city of gold...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Elder-what-now? Is that some kinda senior center?   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
What connection do Shadows have with the Arcana tarot cards? There's so much we don't know...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...We've been looking into that, but there's not much information to go on.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Apparently, I am considered a foreign exchange student at school. Bonjour, as they say.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeah, figures. You don't really look like you're from anywhere 'round here.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Apparently, people at school think I'm a foreign exchange student. Bonjour!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeah, figures. You don't really look like you're from anywhere 'round here.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Awoooo!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Good boy, Koro-chan! You're working so well with the rest of the team!   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I can't waste any more time here, or he'll just laugh at me.   
   
Junpei Iori   
...You got that right. We're with you there, Senpai.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Yes, let's keep going—all the way to the top!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah, we know, boy, we know. We can't stop here. We've got to reach the top.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Isn't it suuuper annoying when adults say things like "Ugh, kids these days"?   
   
Ken Amada   
Haha, I'm sure everyone's heard stuff like that at least once in their lives.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There are plenty of people our age who are well put-together, so maybe they just want to sound mature.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
I've always wanted to experience life in a college dorm, but studying for the exams suuucks...   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If alchemy existed, an entire city could look like this...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, I dunno if I'd like that... It's so shiny here it makes me uncomfortable.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Dude, the glare would be so bad when the sun's out, we'd all go blind or somethin'.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Since it's so bright here, will it be easier to spot Shadows?   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Bring it, Shadows! Come at me...! As they say.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Wha—!? Were you watching some gangster show this time!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That's the spirit. Anyone who wants a beating, come and get it.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
"Bring it, Shadows! Come at me!" Did I sound very gangster?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...You say some really random stuff sometimes, Aigis. Don't ever change.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That's the spirit. Anyone who wants a beating, come and get it.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
This is probably a dumb question, but... Tartarus does have a top floor, right?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Well, normally, it should... But there's nothing "normal" about Tartarus in the first place.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I wanna say yes... But honestly, it's kinda scary we can't even say that with confidence.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I've been wanting a new coat, so maybe I'll buy one and expense it as battle equipment... Just kidding!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Then can I get a new accessory? I need something that'll really highlight my rugged good looks.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...If I can push past my limits, I'm sure I'll find what I've been looking for.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Damn, that sounded so cool... You're like the main character in a sports manga.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
If I do not receive proper maintenance, my joints will begin to creak.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Machines are similar to living creatures in that regard. Both need attention and care.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Do they just need to be oiled? Regular maintenance is certainly important though.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
If I don't get proper maintenance, my joints might start creaking.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Machines are similar to living creatures in that regard. Both need attention and care.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Do they just need to be oiled? Regular maintenance is certainly important though.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
The best feeling in the world... is to be young and in love, am I right? Teehee!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
What's gotten into you? I've never heard anyone go "teehee!" out loud before...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...I can't relate, but I'm happy you're happy.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The 158th floor... If we're truly that far along, I'd expect the air to be thinner here.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Doesn't feel like it... What a shame. Low oxygen levels would've made this a good training spot.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
...I'm getting kinda hungr— Uh, it's nothing! Don't mind me!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Amada-kun, you're in the middle of a growth spurt, right? How about I cook something for you when we get home?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sounds like it's time for a midnight snack. All this movin' around just makes you even more hungry.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
They say that God only gives us trials we can overcome... Do you think that's really true?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If our enemy changes tactics, then we gotta switch it up, too. Think on your feet.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We could take our time exploring if it weren't for the Reaper showing up...   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I am equipped with a thermal sensor that can monitor the temperature of solids, liquids, and gases.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hm... Hot water counts, right? If you've got a timer, we can make ourselves some instant ramen.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Since I have a thermal sensor installed, I can feel when the seasons change.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh. Can you check water temperature, too? If you've got a timer, then we can make some instant ramen.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf...!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan may be blessed by the gods of Naganaki Shrine.   
   
Ken Amada   
Whenever I visit the shrine with Koromaru, I feel as if the gods are protecting us.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
I need to get stronger to protect someone dear to me. One day, you guys will understand how I feel.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I guess Junpei kinda has a point... But the way he says it is so annoying.   
   
Aigis   
In that case... perhaps I can become stronger, too.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I saw one of those 2D fighting games the other day... The characters' footwork was incredibly realistic.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Heh, wanna play a round? I ain't losin' to anybody—not even you, Senpai!   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The décor here makes me wonder... if this place is the manifestation of humanity's desires.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Humanity desires a nest of Shadows? How ironic...   
   
Ken Amada   
Of all things, it had to be a nest of Shadows? That's kind of unexpected.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I just realized... the Shadows can only identify us by sight.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If they don't notice us unless we're right in front of them, they're not as smart as we thought.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If they could hear us, or even sense our presence, we'd likely be surrounded at all times.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I hear that humans do not come with an operations manual. Is that not inconvenient?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's not inconvenient at all. We humans simply make our own decisions.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Can't say I ever thought of following a manual to make my own decisions...   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Humans don't have an operations manual. I'm sure that's why everyone's behavior is so unique.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We make our own decisions, obviously. But it's easier said than done.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Can't say I ever thought of following a manual to make my own decisions...   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I really like this armband... I like it a lot.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It's kinda embarrassing to call it proof of our friendship... but I like it, too.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Woof, woof!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan looks really motivated! We can't wait to see your incredible feats!   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
I wish I could win the lottery or somethin'. I mean, all our hard work deserves a reward, y'know?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Why don't you make a wish at Naganaki Shrine? But I doubt it'll come true, since it's you.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We have to fight together to achieve victory. Of course, that includes our reserves as well.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Take care to conserve your strength for the return trip. Don't push yourself.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah. It's the absolute worst when you're ready to head back, but there's no teleporter close by.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Good point. Sometimes there won't be a teleporter nearby when we decide to head back.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
Maybe I should get a haircut... My hair always gets all curly at the end.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
The tallest building in the world is... 160-something floors, I think. And we're even higher up.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I don't think we can compare the two, but... it is pretty crazy when you put it that way.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
No matter the situation, a single mistake can cost you your life. Never let your guard down.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
If I ever have a dream, would I be able to save its contents to my memory banks?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
As far as I know, you don't have that sort of capability...   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
If I ever have a dream, would I be able to save its contents to my memory banks?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
As far as I know, you don't have that sort of capability...   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Awoooo!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Wow, sound echoes pretty loudly on that floor... It kinda spooked me.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You can train at any time... All you need is some ankle and wrist weights as well as discipline.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
How much higher must we climb...? I can only hope there's an end...   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um... It looks a little hot on that floor. How's everyone feeling?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It does feel humid here, maybe because of the flowing water. Or it could just be all in my head.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It does feel kinda stuffy here... Or is it just my imagination?   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*yawn*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan's yawning! That's a rare sight.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
I'm not gonna sweat the small stuff. I'm just gonna keep climbing as far up as I can!   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It'd be easy to lose sight of a golden Shadow here...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, seriously. It's all glitter and shine here... Let us know if you spot one though, 'kay?   
   
Ken Amada   
It's like camouflage, right? We'll just have to pay close attention!   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Fuuka-san, you are familiar with machinery, yes? I'd like to request for you to tune my motor drive.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um, I don't think I should be making adjustments to your body, Aigis... I'm not a qualified mechanic.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Fuuka-san, are you familiar with machinery? Could you possibly tune my motor drive...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um, I don't think I should be making adjustments to your body, Aigis... I'm not a qualified mechanic.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
Sometimes it's better to take action instead of overthinking, right...?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That's right. If you don't take action, you won't see results.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
If my hair gets even longer, I might have to tie it up... or else it'll just get in the way.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's not all about building muscle. The end goal is to become stronger.   
   
Ken Amada   
You mean we can't lose sight of our original goal...? I'll keep that in mind.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Is there an infinite number of Shadows? Or are new ones constantly being created...?   
   
Junpei Iori   
It's bad either way!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Heh, it doesn't matter to me either way.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf...!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Looks like we have to stick it out for just a little bit longer. Hang in there!   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Do you believe in fortune telling? Is it even accurate?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I do find it interesting... But I really only want to believe in positive outcomes.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If you push yourself here, you can definitely feel yourself grow stronger.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm sure wearing sunglasses here would make it easier on your eyes... I don't have any on me though.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*sniff* *sniff*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan is sniffing the floor. I wonder if a Shadow was just here...   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Did you know some places stop airing ball games before they end? I wonder which regions do that...   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Will I take over the family business...? I must consider this carefully.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
By the way, I am very adept at anaerobic exercise. I am quite confident I could win a contest.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Heh, wanna have a go? If we're talking raw power, I won't go down that easily.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Uh, ain't that pretty obvious? You're a robot, so you don't need oxygen...   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
By the way, I'm very adept at anaerobic exercise. I'm quite confident I could win a contest.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Heh, wanna have a go? If we're talking raw power, I won't go down that easily.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Uh, ain't that pretty obvious? You're a robot, so you don't need oxygen...   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
Arisato-san, your instructions are always so accurate and helpful.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Each floor layout changes every day, but it seems like the structure of the blocks remains the same.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh... It seems like the floor layout here doesn't change.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
You can check Koromaru-san's condition by checking the shine of his fur.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
You can tell how Koromaru-san is doing by checking how shiny his fur is.   
   
Koromaru   
Woof!   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Woof!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The Shadows seem to be getting stronger... You be careful, too, Koro-chan!   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
The Shadows are getting even more powerful. We need to get stronger, too.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
With Koro-chan on our side, we have the strength of a hundred people! Or would it be a hundred dogs instead?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Booyah, level up! That never gets old, does it?   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
If you do not feel well, do not hesitate to fall back. I can keep exploring.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
If you're not feeling well, go ahead and fall back. I can keep exploring.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Stronger weapons are sold at a higher price... The world is quite logical.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If buying them increases our odds of winning, then that's a price worth paying.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Stronger weapons are more expensive... But I suppose that's just how the world works.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If buying them increases our odds of winning, then that's a price worth paying.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
What do you call these kind of flashy patterns again...? Psychedelic?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
When you see a round shape on the ground, it sure is tempting to jump right into the center.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Just look at this area. It almost feels like we're hallucinating.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There are so many colors on this floor, it's hurting my eyes...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Maybe the Shadows did it to mess with us... Actually, doesn't this bother them, too?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Seriously, these colors are so loud, they're driving me insane...   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I'll train as hard as I can for now, and if I never have to use that strength again... then so be it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...I see. Then I'd be happy to be your training partner anytime.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, you're right. It'd be for the best if nothing happens.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Arf...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
This place really makes you dizzy... Koro-chan, are you doing okay?   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Something about the patterns here makes me uneasy... Well, so did the other floors.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
I ain't afraid of anything! You can just leave everything to me!   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
The scenery in this area is unsettling... But maybe that's what they were going for.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...It feels like that eye can see right through us.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's just a pattern on the walls. Don't let it get to you.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Stooop! Don't bring up scary stuff like that!   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Do you think there's any meaning behind all of the different patterns?   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
...I apologize for the inconvenience. I can now fight at an optimal level.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
...I apologize for the inconvenience. I can now fight without any obstructions.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I think Koro-chan's fascinated by the eyes on the wall. They look like they belong on a scarecrow.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
This is seriously making my eyes hurt... But it's too dangerous to look away.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...Apparently, fish eyes are rich in nutrients that are essential for body building.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Did the eye patterns on the wall remind you of that...?   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's hard to navigate and watch out for Shadows in a place like this. Let's try to stay alert.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
If you're tired, you should take a break. I'll work hard for the both of us.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
That's very reassuring. I'll support you to the best of my ability, too!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Heheh, look at you, little dude. I gotta step up my game, too!   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey... If we fall off this pathway, there's no way we'll survive, is there?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
This floor, uh... It ain't gonna crack and break on us outta the blue, right?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Anyone know any songs with a fast tempo? I want something to listen to while working out.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, I can lend you a CD sometime! American pop might be what you're looking for.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I don't really know any intense songs... Would a karaoke song work?   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, um... Maybe if you squint, it'll help you see better.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I already tried that... I almost tripped 'cause I couldn't see where I was goin'.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Is that their aim? To narrow our field of view? How underhanded.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
The school trip... It seems to be a highlight in the school curriculum for most students.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It does, indeed... Probably because they'll be able to make some lifelong memories then.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, yeah, 'cause you get to travel and spend time with girls... Heh heh heh.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
The school trip... It seems to be an important event for most students.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yes, well... I've made some precious memories during the trip myself.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeeep. I nearly died and went to heaven, travelin' with the girls... Literally.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan seems to be saying that he has to get even stronger.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Is this what it's like to party hard at a club? I've actually never been to one before.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Maybe it's just me, but I get the impression that the motif for each block in Tartarus is "fear"...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Well, this place definitely gives me the creeps... Who in the world would design something like this?   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
It seems easy to lose visual on this floor, but I will not miss my target.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
It'd be easy to lose visual on this floor, but I won't miss my target.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
The one souvenir you absolutely have to get in Kyoto is their famous snack, yatsuhashi, right?   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Seems like we still have a ways to go... It's like there's no end in sight.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You can gauge the distance by the spacing of the patterns on the floor. How convenient.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm not sure if it's because of our surroundings, but I'm sensing some hostility. Please be careful.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*sniff* *sniff*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I wonder... Does every Shadow carry a different scent?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
What floor are we on now? I'm starting to forget what the lower levels were like.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Arisato-kun, sometimes you summon Personas we've never seen before out of nowhere.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
This place seems like a hallucination. I wonder if someone actually thought of something like this.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...It seems everyone here has gone through various hardships and came out stronger.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I wonder if Escapade looks like this at night...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Now I feel like dancin'... I should throw on some jams, get us groovin'.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
The color saturation in this area is very high, which may cause some discomfort to the human eye.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
The color saturation in this area is very high. That may be hard on your eyes.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I've heard that Kinkakuji Temple can transform into a giant robot... But is it really true?   
   
Aigis   
A machine with the function and capability for a large-scale transformation... How intriguing.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Given the existence of the Dark Hour and Tartarus, I wouldn't say it's impossible...   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
It's like we're stuck in one hell of a trippy maze, where all the Shadows are getting stronger.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Building muscles is a lot like watering plants. If you don't do it regularly, they won't grow.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hm... I can't tell if that sounds real smart or real dumb.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
After making it this far, this place looks nothing like a school anymore.   
   
Junpei Iori   
But, like... it hasn't looked that way for a good while now.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
This place is so visually distracting, but let's try and keep an eye out for Shadows, too.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It's a little too late to ask this, but, Koro-chan, are your paws okay? This flooring is kinda peculiar, so...   
   
Ken Amada   
You're amazing, Koromaru... No matter the place, you're always so agile.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Would you say that we live in an urban city?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well, it's certainly not rural. Plus, it's pretty comfortable living here.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hm, I'm not sure... It's hard to tell when you live there.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It kind of feels like... those giant eyes are looking right at us.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I-It's just decoration though, right...?   
   
Junpei Iori   
N-Nah, be for real... They're just for, uh, scarin' off birds! Like those Shadows we saw.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
If things take a turn for the worse, then we could take the plunge and leave, right?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Guess so... Looks like we still have a ways to go anyway.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
...Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Every time we lose focus, Koro-chan's bark snaps us to attention.   
   
Junpei Iori   
It's like you're telling me to keep it together... Yeah, I know, I know!   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh yeah, remember that game I gave you? I hear it's shutting down or somethin'.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All these flashing colors make it hard to stay focused...   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
A lot has happened, but don't worry. The Kirijo Group will continue to support our activities.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
It appears we still have a long way to go. Shall we continue, or head back?   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
It looks like we still have a long way to go. Should we keep pushing forward or go back?   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
If a dog can be a Persona-user, then maybe a cat could... Nah, no way that'd happen.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Considering our circumstances, we can't dismiss it as an impossibility...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
No matter what they are, if they're willing to fight on our side, I'll welcome them with open arms.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I've gotten used to fighting the strong ones that block our path... But just how many are there?   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*sniff* *sniff*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Could the smells here be bothering him...? Do you smell anything in that area?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Do you think the air's gonna start to thin out the higher up we go...?   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All of us are equal before the face of time... We should have known our place.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Kirijo-senpai...   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Shadows move so fast... You'd never guess from the way they look.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Maybe they actually got a bunch of hidden legs— Eugh, great. Now that's seared into my brain.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
That's just one of the many things that make them weird and creepy...   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
These patterns appear to be an optical illusion. Be careful they do not cause your brains to overload.   
   
Ken Amada   
Yeah, I'm starting to feel dizzy after staring at them for so long...   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Those patterns appear to be an optical illusion. I fear they may overwhelm you.   
   
Ken Amada   
Yeah, I'm starting to feel dizzy after staring at them for so long...   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
All of these colors are making my eyes hurt... I'll try not to get separated from everyone.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I always doze off in Mr. Edogawa's class... Maybe I should record his lectures for when I can't fall asleep.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Haha, I bet that'd be super effective. I'd be knocked out 'til morning!   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'm sure these lights might drive some people insane, but that won't work on me.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Those eyes aren't going to shoot laser beams or anything... are they?   
   
Aigis   
...I have yet to detect any corresponding heat source for such a function.   
   
Ken Amada   
I kinda want to see that... But that'd put us in danger, so maybe not.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hehe... I think Koro-chan is looking out for us, too. Thank you, Koro-chan.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You have to clean up your act to be a better person, but isn't it hard to be polished all the time?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Don't you get kinda sad when you have to leave behind your old weapons?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, I guess so. It's hard to decide between one you're used to and one that's new and stronger.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hm... Is this what it looks like inside a night club?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Uh, kinda, I guess? Not that I'd know, honestly.

Mitsuru Kirijo   
Every time I come here, it feels as if I'm being watched.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
U-Um... You're not referring to me, are you?   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I have been counting the circular patterns on the walls, just in case... Would this data be useful?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Uh... Yeah, no. I don't think so.   
   
Ken Amada   
I was trying to do that, too, but... my vision kept spinning, and I got dizzy and lost count.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I've been counting the circular patterns on the walls, just in case... Would this data be useful?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Uh... Yeah, no. I don't think so.   
   
Ken Amada   
I was trying to do that, too, but... my vision kept spinning, and I got dizzy and lost count.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
Autumn leaves always fall so quickly... Oh, is that why people want to go see them?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I guess it's the same for cherry blossoms. Hopefully, we can go see them together one day...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The human heart finds beauty in all that is transient... Isn't that mysterious?   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Dog therapy must be really effective, considering how Koro-chan makes me feel.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Are you watching your health and stamina? Remember not to push yourself too hard.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I feel like you can get all your everyday essentials from Paulownia Mall and the shopping district.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh, you really do get stronger with more experience. I thought that was just in video games.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
This world is the picture of "madness"... Let's proceed through this area as quickly as possible.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Would it be possible to use my spent bullet casings to leave a trail?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Damn, that sounds badass! Oh, wait... The floor layout is always changin' though.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I wonder if it'd be possible to use my spent bullet casings to leave a trail...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Damn, that sounds badass! Oh, wait... The floor layout is always changin' though.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
All of you are gonna be graduating next year, huh...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah... I don't think it's hit me yet. Oh, but Junpei might end up repeating the year.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
If we all go on a trip together, I bet the journey would be just as fun as the destination.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeah, totally! We'd stuff our faces with snacks and play card games. It'd be a blast!   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
The scenery here may be distracting, but at least the Shadows aren't that different.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The size of each floor really does vary from one another—not that it's anything new.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You're doing well, Koro-chan. Good job keeping close to our leader!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You're such a smart boy, Koromaru. You follow us around even without a leash.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
I'm the type of gamer who never wants to use items and just ends up hoarding them...   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The 191st floor... This tower's mass far exceeds that of the entire school, though I suppose that's fairly obvious.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It seems like this place gets even more bizarre the higher we go.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
The Shadows are also getting stronger. That's proof we're closer to our goal.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Right... Looking back, the lower floors seem normal in comparison.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan seems really focused on the designs on the walls, doesn't he?   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
During winter, the sound the arrow makes when it hits the target is so satisfying!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hm, maybe it's because of the temperature? The air feels cleaner and crisp during winter.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If I smash through the walls and floor... do you think I could make us a shortcut?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Do you only have muscles in your brain!? You wanna bring us down with this whole tower!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I get the feeling he's not kidding... Senpai, please don't do it.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Everything will become clear soon enough... All we can do now is press on.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Everything will become clear soon enough... All we can do now is press on.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
If I drink protein like Sanada-san... will it make me stronger?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Not if you drink it alone. If you're interested, you can come to me for advice.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
To predict the enemy's next move, don't rely on sight alone—use all your senses.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It's fine to follow trends, but in the end, you should just wear what you actually like.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Every time I start cleaning my room, it's all over when I find a manga to read.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...I wonder how much longer it'll take until we reach the top.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
...Oh, I-I'm sorry! I didn't get much sleep last night...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Don't worry about it. We do come out here after midnight.   
   
Junpei Iori   
...Aw, crap. Now I'm sleepy.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
If I had Koromaru-san's sense of smell, then I could help detect enemy positions.   
   
Koromaru   
Woof, woof!   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
If I had Koromaru-san's sense of smell, then I could help detect enemy positions.   
   
Koromaru   
Woof, woof!   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
Do you ever wake up early on days when you don't have any plans?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yep. I'll give up on sleeping in and try to get up, only to knock back out and end up running late...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I feel that... But whenever I have archery practice in the morning, I can't bring myself to get up at all...   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Despite his small size, Koro-chan is very powerful!   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I'm craving something sweet... Something with lots of calories.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
I wonder if I'd actually be into temples and shrines when I'm older.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
With all of these lights, the electric bill must be astounding... Oh, sorry.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Heh, you're really on top of managing things, Yamagishi.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Betcha it's more than the school's electric bill. Probably costs as much as Kirijo-senpai's crib.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I always take some time to maintain my weapons before bed so they don't suddenly break in battle.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hitting the center of that eyeball-lookin' thing is worth 100 points! Or not...   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I think... I've seen that pattern before. I just can't remember where.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I was thinkin' the same thing... Oh, it kinda looks like the design on a ramen bowl!   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Should I undergo a large-scale update sometime in the future?   
   
Junpei Iori   
You mean like what we do with our phones? Nah, I think you're okay the way you are, Ai-chan.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Should I undergo a large-scale update sometime in the future?   
   
Junpei Iori   
You mean like what we do with our phones? Nah, I think you're okay the way you are, Ai-chan.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I wonder if there's a way to recover both our stamina and our concentration...   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, that reminds me... I have to wash Koro-chan's clothes when we get home.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
You don't see many young'uns into baseball these days. What's hip now? Soccer? Basketball?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I gotta face off against another person once in a while, or else I might lose that competitive drive.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I kind of feel sorry for anyone fighting you in your next match, Sanada-senpai...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Senpai, you've got, like, superhuman strength. Your next match will probably see you as a monster.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
That floor seems to be the halfway point of this block.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Woof!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
"Koromaru" is such a lovely name. I'm sure you love it, too, don't you, Koro-chan?   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...I remember the days when I was happy we had reached the 100th floor.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I will fight at full power... I must, because that is my duty.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We're counting on you, Aigis, but don't forget... all of us are here for you, too.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We all feel the same way. Let's fight together, Aigis.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If I ever get some time to myself, I'd like to go on a journey to train and hone my skills.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We've reached the 199th floor... I can't believe there's more than 200.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Once upon a time, I thought we'd be done by the 30th floor... Yeah, those days are long gone.   
   
Aigis   
Were this a normal structure, we would be about 800 meters above ground... if such a structure existed.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
There are a lot of things I should be thinking about... like the future.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
I was hopin' the 200th floor would be the end goal. 'Course it's not that easy...   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The 200th floor... Hopefully, we're at least halfway to the top now.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Ta-dah da-daah! We've reached the 200th floor.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Awww yea— Wait, uh... So how many floors are left?   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Awoooo!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Good job making it to the 200th floor, but there's still more up ahead.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It's been getting chilly recently. Let's take care not to catch a cold.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah, stay warm and strengthen your immune system.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The Shadows keep getting stronger the further we go in... But I'm not worried. We've also grown.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Honestly... I'm a little jealous that all of you have matching combat attire.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
But, Aigis, you're also geared up just like us, right? You've got your very own armband, too.   
   
Ken Amada   
The skirts seem really airy and flowy. Are they easier to move around in?   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
When I think of everyone in the city getting Apathy Syndrome... it sends shivers down my spine.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We should head back if you're tired. There's no point in pushing yourself until you collapse.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
The enemy attacks have gotten more intense. Maybe it's because we're past the 200th floor.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Do you think the Shadows would go stir crazy from being cooped up in here for too long?   
   
Junpei Iori   
They're probably used to it by now... Actually, haven't they always been pretty crazy?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
They've been crazy this whole time, so I don't think it really matters...   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf...!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Even if we don't understand your words, your feelings still come through to us.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
If the teleporters suddenly go kaput, even Junpei, Ace Detective, wouldn't know what to do.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'd rather not think about that... 200 floors is just too much.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
The higher we climb, the stronger the enemy. We can't afford to be careless.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
Right now, it might be easier for us to act first, think later.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Agreed... There's no point wasting time worrying about our next move.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We're well over 200 floors high now... This tower won't suddenly snap off and collapse, will it?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
After we made it this far, I certainly hope not.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We can't rely on common sense to plan ahead here, but we must proceed nevertheless.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sometimes you need luck to win a match, but, obviously, luck alone isn't enough.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Man... Luck's never on my side when I need it.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Is anyone here afraid of heights? Fortunately, you can't see outside, so it shouldn't be a problem.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It feels like those eyes are always following my every move... I can't get used to it.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Now that we're so high up... I wonder if Koro-chan can tell if there's a change in atmospheric pressure.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Y'know, we had some pretty rough times, but we made it this far... We did good, team.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If I stare at these colors for too long... I feel like my eyes will get tired.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Don't pay attention to them so much. You'll get used to them eventually.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh god... I can still see the patterns even when I close my eyes.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I hear someone named Santa flies all over the world in a single night... What terrifying efficiency.   
   
Junpei Iori   
You got that right. That guy's real chill though. Get it? 'Cause it's winter? Oh, Junpei, you sleigh me.   
   
Ken Amada   
I wonder if Santa Claus can move around during the Dark Hour...   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
It's pretty hard to act as if everything's normal, isn't it?   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I kinda wish I was at home, relaxing underneath a kotatsu and eating some tangerines...   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
We can't have just one person in the limelight. Not when this is a team effort.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...Did I hear that right? Junpei said something cool for once?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You think we're in the upper half of the tower yet? Maybe we could try sprinting to the top.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm sure our classmates would find it hard to believe that we've been fighting here...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Then it'd be better to keep them in the dark.   
   
Junpei Iori   
That's the tough part about bein' a hero. Nobody gets what we're goin' through.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf, arf...!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I wish I could understand what Koro-chan's saying. Then we could keep chatting with each other.   
   
Aigis   
Yes, I will pass on Koromaru-san's words to everyone to the best of my ability.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If you're ever in doubt, just take a deep breath. Only then will you find the way forward.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Akihiko Explains It All! I bet a show like that would reap in the ratings, huh?   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Nothing about this place even remotely resembles the school at this point.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You know what...? Doesn't it kind of remind you of a karaoke booth?   
   
Junpei Iori   
I mean, it never really looked like a school in the first place!   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The tower must use a lot of energy in order to shuffle every single floor.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
When we come here, we just need to focus on fighting.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If we're taken out before the final battle... that'd be one sick joke.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You're absolutely right. I'll keep that in mind, too.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
When I see something marked as "limited edition," I'm always tempted to buy it.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Dude, I've been getting a good workout, but why the heck do the stairs at the station still do me in?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Maybe it's not your physical strength that's improved, but the strength of your heart.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We've gone through so much to get this far. We can't stop here.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
My mission was simply to be by your side, but... nowadays, I've been having fun at school as well.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sounds like you've settled in. You should enjoy your time as a student to the fullest.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
The number of people suffering from Apathy Syndrome seems to be increasing...   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I want to get as many nutrients as I can from my meals. Would supplements help with that?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's normal for your body to feel stiffer in cold weather. Make sure to warm up, just in case.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It looks like we're inside a kaleidoscope... Only these colors are so vivid they make me uncomfortable.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf...!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I think he's saying we can rely on him. You're so kind, Koro-chan.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
I guess we just gotta tackle this headfirst! Like busting your ass on a test you didn't study for!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That's not quite— Oh, never mind.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm not trying to look at the scenery or anything, but it's just so distracting...   
   
Junpei Iori   
I've gotten used to it by now, but for some reason, I kinda wanna graffiti the walls.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Just try to take it easy, Fuuka.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
Even in times like this, Koromaru manages to stay so calm and collected.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
He's certainly one reliable dog. The one who's most put together might actually be Koro-chan.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*whine*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan's pure white fur gives him a proud, majestic image.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I end up splurging a bit during winter... Knit tops and coats aren't cheap.   
   
Ken Amada   
Yukari-san, you're always so stylish.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Clothes that are both cute and comfortable come with a hefty price tag, don't they?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Damn, if there's a Gatekeeper, that means we still have a ways to go.   
   
Aigis   
...You may be correct, but it is also a sign that we are making progress.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Even now, enemies continue to block our path... The only way forward is to go through them.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
When this is all over... I'd like to go to karaoke and sing a song perfectly.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Ahaha, well, don't you sound confident! I can't wait to hear you sing.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I think you could do it, Aigis! If you hit the right notes and stay on beat, it's definitely possible!   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
Even at a time like this, you still have tests and exams... High school sure sounds rough.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Seriously... I can't concentrate in class like usual. Hey, what's with the funny look!?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We've cheated death a few times on our way here. Who knows what lies ahead...?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
I bet this year was more intense for us than anyone else.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You've covered so much ground exploring this place. I don't think I could ever do that...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You just have to train a little bit every day and you'll keep up with us in no time.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Now that you mention it, my stamina's improved... But I still haven't lost weight!   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I can't stop here. I'll keep pressing forward—together, with everyone else.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I feel like that eye thing is watching me... It's really uncomfortable.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Perhaps Tartarus itself is conscious...? No, never mind. Let's not go there.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It's so creepy... I always end up looking right back at it.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I gotta calm down... I can keep going!   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
What if I climbed all the way up here from the bottommost level? Heh, that'd be one hell of a workout...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Uh, you serious? That don't sound like a joke, Senpai...   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
No matter how much progress I make, I never feel satisfied enough to stop.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I wonder if Shadows gather in other places like this...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Though I'd rather not entertain the thought, you have a point... We'll have to look into it eventually.   
   
Junpei Iori   
If they do, maybe some of 'em go underground?   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Wo-Woof!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh no, Koro-chan, did you slip? Watch your step, okay?   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
The first sunrise of the new year... It's the same sun as always, but this time... it looks a little different.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
The enemies are getting stronger, but so am I!   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Honestly, it's a real pain in the neck trying to count past 200 floors...   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
If only there was a safe place for us to take a break...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Like some sort of safe room? That'd certainly be convenient...   
   
Aigis   
In other words, a "safe room." It would be very beneficial.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Right now, there's only one thing on my mind... And that is to fight to the very end, with all my strength.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You're so calm, Koro-chan. I think you're braver than anyone else here.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
The air's been so dry recently, my lips are all chapped... I gotta buy some lip balm.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
It seems impossible to climb to this height without a teleporter.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You think so? I think I could give it a shot.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hm... Does anyone know Koro-chan's Chinese zodiac? Was he born in the year of the dog?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'm not going to lose... No, I can't afford to lose.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
The Shadows are a force to be reckoned with... But so are we!   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
No matter how hard I try, I can't think of a single reason for the floors to be designed this way...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Maybe there ain't one. They probably didn't think anyone would climb this thing.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Perhaps it was designed without rhyme or reason.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I guess people around the world aren't afraid because they don't know anything about this...   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Woof...!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan, if you feel like going back, let Arisato-kun know, okay?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Even at a time like this, we can still feel hungry. Maybe I'll get a beef bowl at Umiushi tomorrow.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, maybe we could leave some supplies at school to use later! Oh, wait... Never mind.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Considering what happened during your rescue, it'd probably be too tough to locate hidden supplies.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It'd probably be faster to bring them with us. Looking for them later sounds way too hard.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan, are you cold? Well, I guess you can endure the cold better than hotter temperatures.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
In the end... I'm glad I got to speak with Ryoji-kun.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
In the beginning, this place still looked like a building, but now... I have no idea.   
   
Ken Amada   
It looks less and less realistic. I wonder if that's supposed to mean anything...   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
If I had a little more arm strength, my spear attacks could be more powerful...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
There's no rush. You handle the spear so skillfully, it makes up for the lack of power.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf...!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan, you also have something you want to protect, don't you?   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Attending school at a time like this actually helps me stay sane.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
This area is strangely bright... It makes you forget that it's midnight—or, rather, the Dark Hour.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Are Shadows nocturnal...? What do they do during the day?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Haha, can't say I ever thought of that.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Maybe they're sleeping... If only we could get the jump on them then.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
No matter how many we beat, more Shadows just seem to pop out of nowhere.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I thought there'd be less the further we go, but I guess not...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
This entire place is a "nest," from bottom up, huh. There's no sign of them dying out at all.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I'm happy I got the chance to wear a kimono. Is it possible to modify one to wear in battle?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You looked great, Aigis, but... I dunno about wearing one while fighting though.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Silk is both light and durable, but there'd be way too much air resistance... So probably not.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Is it a little too late to ask if they could please install an elevator to the top?   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Do you think Shadows understand the concept of teamwork...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...I'd say it's possible, based on what we've seen with the large Shadows.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Who knows? Teamwork or not, they're all going down.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
...Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan might be the first dog to climb to the highest point in the world.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
My power will surely be of help to you... I truly do believe that.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
No matter what happens, I feel like I'll be fine as long as I'm with all of you.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
...I feel the same way, too.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We have to reach the top by the Promised Day... We'll pull it off somehow!   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
What's up ahead... is nothing like what we've experienced so far. Be ready for anything.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What a bizarre floor... This is the first time I've seen anything like it.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, if you think about it, aren't all the floors pretty bizarre?   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
For a second... I thought this place was actually kind of pretty.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Everything's all white...! Man, it's totally different from the last area.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I mean, it does look nice, but it feels kinda empty... And really creepy.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I said that I won't run anymore. I'll do my best till the very end!   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan... You understand everything that's going on, right? And you still want to follow us?   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
This place is stark white... It looks beautiful, but there's something eerie about it.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
I'm gonna stop thinking 'bout stupid things, like how we've got a heavy burden and all that.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Are you watching, Father? This is the path I've chosen. This is my resolve.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Everyone's so much stronger now. I know we can make it through this.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I'm glad I got stronger, but I could really do without all the extra muscle...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Heh, of course we can. And we'll come out of this even stronger.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
The atmosphere on this floor is very unusual...   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
"The Promised Day," huh... All we can do now is keep moving forward.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We'll overcome every single obstacle that stands in our way!   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
This is like the final level in a video game, right? Well, don't forget to save before the big boss fight!   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...It doesn't matter what's waiting for us. I'll take it down with my bare fists.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
My body seems to match with the scenery here... I think I might blend in with the background.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh no... But as long as we can find you, Ai-chan, all's well that blends well! Get it...?   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf...!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I can sense Koro-chan's determination... It really inspires me to do my part, too.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
My Persona represents the strength of my heart... And from hereon, my heart will never falter.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
A floor that's entirely white... Koro-chan, be careful not to get lost.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Whatever this is... it stands out even more against the white floor. Kind of like blood...   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
...I'm so sleepy. I stayed up too late playing a game yesterday.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Good to see that you're the same as always... Real good.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
The flooring looks uneven, but that shouldn't be problem during a fight.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
When I put on this combat gear... I get reminded of all the battles we've gone through.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Huh... These patterns look a bit like the ones we saw at the temple gardens in Kyoto.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You mean the zen gardens? There's a belief that they connect this world to the next...   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
If possible, I want to visit Yakushima again. I'd like to see the ocean one more time.   
   
Ken Amada   
I want to come, too. It sounds like a beautiful place...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeah, sure, but... can we all agree that what happens in Yakushima stays in Yakushima?   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
To be honest... I'm still scared. But, more than that, I really don't want to lose.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm glad you're with us, Amada. Your presence is truly reassuring.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
There was a New Year's sale, so I bought some spring knitwear. I can't wait for winter to end!   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, wouldn't it be neat if Yuka-tan and the others wore some elegant kimonos to fight?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
No way... A kimono's too confining. It'd be way too hard to fight in one.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
A kimono can easily fall apart if you move too recklessly. It'd be a difficult battle.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
When this is all over, shall we order some more sushi again?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh hell yeah, Senpai! Now we gotta win for sure, Minato!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You better not spare any expense. We'll only have the high-quality stuff!   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hm... I'm sure there's some reason this area is shaped this way.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
This architectural style... I suppose you could call it mysterious?   
   
Aigis   
It almost resembles Heaven... Though Hell might be more fitting.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It's so bright here... It's almost like it's daylight.   
   
Junpei Iori   
But it's supposed to be midnight— Er, the Dark Hour, right? Man, that's so wack.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, it doesn't really feel like we're inside Tartarus.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I've taken down many, many Shadows... So much so, now I don't even blink tearing one apart.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Er, you sound a little scary right now, but, um... keep up the good work?   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I wonder what this floor looks like from Koro-chan's perspective...   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
An enemy that can't be defeated... I'm sure the old Yukari would've given up already.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Looks like the scrubs 'round here are finally getting serious.   
   
Aigis   
Indeed. Let's destroy them with our full power!   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
How is it so bright here...? Where does the light come from?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It also feels cold... Do you suppose it's the moonlight?   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Living together, traveling and spending time together... I've made some fine memories this past year.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
Has everyone written their wish for the new year? I wished for some hope.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I wonder what the top of this tower looks like...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, we're about to find out! When we get there, I'll burn the sight into my memory!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I haven't a clue... But I'm certain we'll get there and find out for ourselves.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Okay, this silence is killing me. How 'bout we play a word association game? I'll start... "TEAM"!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Leader... could you please tell him to— Hey, that doesn't count, okay!? I'm not playing!   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
These Shadows are quite the formidable foe...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That just means we're getting close to our goal.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Aw man, they're getting even stronger? Seriously, could they cut us some slack for once...?   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I have a bad feeling about this block... I'm not sure why, but it seems more dangerous than the others.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah, I know where you're coming from, but that just means we're close to the end.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
In that case... we best proceed with caution.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*whine*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I think even Koro-chan can tell that there's something sad about this place...   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
When there's something blocking the road ahead, you just gotta charge forward at full speed!   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Right now, let's keep our goal nice and simple: get to the top.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I've only gotten this far because I had all of you by my side... I'm sure of it.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I wonder what he would say at a time like this...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Who knows...? But he was the kind of guy who'd aim for the top no matter what anyone says.   
   
Koromaru   
*whine*   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I can't believe we're almost third-years... Feels like we've grown up too quickly.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey now, what's with that attitude? We're still young and free, you know!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
So much happened during my three years of high school... Everything went by in a flash.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
This place is so empty, at least as far as I can see... Perhaps it's foreshadowing the end of everything.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We've come so far... Looks like we were right to appoint you as our leader.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
This will be our final stand... It's going to be an intense battle, but we can't turn back now.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
One year ago today, I could never imagine we'd be where we are now.   
   
Junpei Iori   
What was I even doing back then? Probably had more free time than I do now, that's for sure.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's nearly been an entire year since you guys came... Time really flies.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
If only our tests were all about beating up Shadows. I'd pass with flying colors!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Are you sure about that? You're pretty bad at written exams.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
If Heaven really does exist... would it be a place like this?   
   
Junpei Iori   
No! I get that this place looks the part, but god, please no!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We won't find out, not today. It's not our time yet. We're going to make it out alive.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
Our goal is finally in sight... Now, more than ever, we can't waste any more time.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Did your collar get loose? Koro-chan, let's make sure you're in perfect condition, okay?   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We should be properly equipped for what lies ahead. I'll leave it to you, Arisato-kun.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
I'm not really fazed by it anymore... But, dude, isn't this place insane?   
   
Aigis   
If we fall from here... it will all be over.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I've got my training regimen planned out for the next six months. It'll be intense.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
That definitely seems like something you'd do, Senpai. I should think about my own plans, too.   
   
Ken Amada   
Can I join you? I want to get stronger, too!   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Once this battle is over... I wouldn't mind another trip to Yakushima with everyone.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...Yeah, that'd be great. We had a lot of fun last time.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Heh, sounds like a plan! Count me in!   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
After the battle ends... I wonder if we'll view the moon any differently.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, only one way to find out... Once we wrap up here, let's all go moon-watching together!   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
Everyone sure looked nice in their kimonos. Maybe I should wear one next year, too...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm sure you'll look great, Amada-kun. I can't wait to see what you've picked out.   
   
Junpei Iori   
That means you won't be wearing any— Uh, it's nothing! Never mind!   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Woof!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There's no doubt that Koro-chan is our guardian angel.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
We're long past the 200th floor by now. The least they could do is set up a convenience store for us.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'll take on all the powerful foes. The tougher they are, the stronger I'll become.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
This path doesn't look the safest, but it shouldn't be a problem... I think.   
   
Ken Amada   
My legs are shaking right now... But I have to keep going!   
   
Junpei Iori   
I trust you, Fuuka! I really do! But I think I'mma crap my pants!   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I want to go to Yakushima for our next summer vacation, too!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, good idea! Operation Yakushima Beach Fling, Round 2 is on! You'll help us out, won'tcha?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Let's make that happen, then, with everyone here.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The 241st floor... Were this a normal building, it would probably be about 1,000 meters tall.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Aw man, I really didn't need to hear that... Now I'm feelin' weak in the knees!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I don't know the exact height, but we certainly are high up.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
If you think about it... perhaps the Shadows are on a mission, just like us.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
That deadline makes me anxious, but... I just have to do what I have to do.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Ugh, looking down is making me sweat... You don't wanna know where.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
The date of the final battle is set. All we have to do now is be at our peak by then.

Fuuka Yamagishi   
What part of the school do you think this is...? The roof?   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hehe... Pretend this is one of your usual strolls and just relax, okay?   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Let's take a group photo to commemorate— Oh wait, cameras don't work here.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Staring at a white background like this is real hard on the eyes...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Seriously... I should've brought sunglasses or something.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Do you suppose the scenery here serves some kind of purpose...?   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I want to face tomorrow with everyone, together... That's why I'll fight with all my strength.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan is totally at ease even though he's in unfamiliar territory. He's really amazing.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We've been getting stronger, but I know we haven't hit our limits yet.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Does anyone need to take a break?   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
We're really high up now... It'd be a dangerous fall, even for me.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Okay, but at least you could fly out of danger with those rocket boosters of yours, Ai-chan.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
If you're in trouble, Aigis, what does that mean for us...? Er, I'm just not gonna think about that.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Woof!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm sure the priest is also cheering you on, Koro-chan...!   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Man, I didn't even have time to let loose and relax this New Year...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
No amount of rigorous training can prepare you for an actual battle, after all.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Didn't get a chance to clean my room before the end of the year... Oh well, maybe next year!   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The walls here are blindingly bright... It's unbearable when light reflects off of them.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Is anyone cold? The white walls gave me the impression that it's cool up there...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'm not, but maybe that's because I'm so fired up.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It is a bit chilly, but there are more important things to worry about!   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
Nobody knows for sure what's wrong or right... Maybe that's why people are anxious about the future.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I can't accept that you'll find "salvation" in death...   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, aren't we like... a party of brave heroes about to throw down with the demon king?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Things are going smoothly. All that's left is to wait for the big match to start.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
There's not much time left to spare. We can't afford to stop here.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koromaru's name is written with the characters for "tiger" and "wolf"... Huh, isn't it the year of the tiger now?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
This place is so well-lit, it's a lot easier to spot the Shadows.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
"Two in harmony surpasses one in perfection," and with all of us together we will be even stronger...!   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
My body is trembling... Am I malfunctioning? No... It must be my heart trembling inside my chest.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
No matter how much I train, I still get nervous... Maybe it's like having test anxiety?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Don't let your nerves get to you, Arisato. Then again, you've never had that problem.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hm, maybe... this is what the world will look like in the distant future?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh, I can see that... It does kinda feel like we're inside a UFO or somethin'.   
   
Ken Amada   
Oh, maybe. It does look like we should be running into aliens instead of Shadows.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
These days... I don't really care about what other people think of me anymore.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I see... You're really something, you know.   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
What do you smell there? Is it different from the other scents we've encountered so far?   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We should totally have a girls' night soon. We'll stay up all night snacking and chatting...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hehe. That sounds like a lot of fun. I'll make sure to bring a bunch of snacks.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hehe, sounds like it'll be a long night. I'll have to free up my schedule for the next day.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Man, I really wanna go to karaoke... Since it's quiet here, mind if I practice for a bit?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...Sounds like a good way to keep the Shadows at bay, but at the cost of our hearing.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
With how bright this area is, it might be easier to spot Shadows.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Then maybe it's time for us to go on the offensive.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yep, they stick out like a sore thumb! Time to hammer 'em down!   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Grrr...!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Well, aren't you raring to go, Koro-chan? It's as if he's saying, "Now's the time."   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
...Lately, I haven't found any new material for Junpei's Believe It, or Don't.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...Please keep it that way. Besides, aren't ghost stories usually told during summer?   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
As long as I'm wearing this armband, nothing can bring me down.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The 250th floor... I believe we may be close to the end.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
If we all become third-years... I hope we can all be in the same class again.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Heehee, I'd like that, too. We'll definitely become third-years—all five of us.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Wait... Did you say "if"? Not "when"? Uh, are you saying I'm being held back...?   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
Last night, I saw my mom in my dreams... That's all to it, really.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
They're all watching over us from somewhere... Knowing that, I feel like I can go on.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I don't have any proof, but we're getting close—I can feel it! Nothing can stop us now!   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
If only we had a functioning car here. Then we could just run over any Shadow we see!   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
There's someone else here, watching over us... Do you feel his presence, Akihiko?   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf...!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I think he's saying... we're not too far from the top.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Arisato-kun... All of us will follow your lead, no matter what decision you make.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
My body feels even lighter than usual. If you tag me in, I promise you won't regret it.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We've reached the 252nd floor... That's higher than any building in the real world.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
It's ironic... I've learned so much about what it means to live by fighting the Shadows.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
If we all work together, we can definitely win against an undefeatable enemy!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Heehee, you're right. As long as we stick together, we'll be fine.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Haha, I think so, too. Let's win this, together.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
It's probably a little late to ask this, but why do folks transmogrify into coffins of all things?   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I won't lose sight of my goals ever again. I'm keeping my eyes trained on the top.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
We're so close to the end... Just thinking about it makes me nervous.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I feel the same way, but we'll be able to pull through—I'm sure we can.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Haha, you know, you're just like the rest of us, Ai-chan!   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Right... This is where the real battle begins. Koro-chan, you're so reliable.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Now that we've made it this far... we've got to see this through!   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
What's waiting for us up ahead...? Honestly, I'm a little scared to find out...   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
I think I understand why I awakened to this power now... And what it means.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Daaang, we're already past the 250th floor... Do ya reckon it goes up to 300?   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I know this is an awful, terrible place, but... this area is somewhat beautiful.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Just now, I finally realized... I have my own way of fighting.   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
The end is near... And we're going to win, of course.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Do you have any plans in February yet? Valentine's Day waits for no man!   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan, you've become much, much stronger than when we first met you.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
This whole time, I've been a nervous wreck... But strangely enough, I feel really calm right now.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Aw crap, I think I left the TV on in my room!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Why are you like this...? You better turn it off when you get back.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Heehee... It makes me happy to see that Junpei-kun hasn't changed at all.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared... But that changes nothing. We're here all the same.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
January 31st... Had we more time, we could've been better prepared.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Heh, getting cold feet? We just have to do what we can.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
If we fail, nobody will live to see tomorrow... Tonight, we have to prevail!   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Everyone, expect to fight till the bitter end tonight, but know that we'll make it out alive.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
"Fight to the bitter end," huh? Heh, I like the sound of that.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
"Fight to the bitter end"? Sounds kinda cheesy, but... I'm with you!   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We have to keep going. Our future is at stake!   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
...Don't worry about me. I'm no longer lost. I know what I have to do.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
I will never forget this journey, nor the friends I've made...   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It's kind of sad when people can't see eye-to-eye, isn't it?   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
That Jin guy... I know he was our enemy and all, but... I can't help feelin' kinda bad about it.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...I feel sorry for him, but I'm sure he stood by his convictions to the very end.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...He was a victim as well, just like everyone else. We must keep that in mind.   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
This time, for sure... We'll put an end to Tartarus and the Dark Hour!   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
*whine*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It's really sad when you can understand someone else's words... but not their feelings.   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We're so close... With all of us together, we'll be able to pull through!   
   
Junpei Iori   
You got that right! Let's end this!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah, exactly. That's why we all came here.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
...Just keep your eyes on me. I ain't gonna lose.   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Back then, I swore that I would face things head-on. Watch me, Shinji.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
This is the 261st floor... We're almost at the top!   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
Whatever happens, I'll never forget the promise I made. We'll all come home together, for sure!   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Woof!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
...I promise you, too, Koro-chan. We'll all go home together!   
   
------   
   
Yukari Takeba   
This is it... We're gonna make it out alive, all of us, together.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'll do everything I can to support everyone!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We will, I promise. Yukari, we're counting on you.   
   
------   
   
Junpei Iori   
Alright, look alive, folks! Just follow my lead!   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
So this is where it ends... No. This is the battle we'll keep fighting till the end.   
   
------   
   
Aigis   
So there was still a score we had to settle...   
   
------   
   
Ken Amada   
In the end... heroes will always win. Let's do this!   
   
------   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf...!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You can do it, Koro-chan! We're all with you!   
   
------   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I don't need any "salvation." I'll crush that false hope with my own two hands!

Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_DORMITORY_01
I wonder if Kirijo-senpai and the others are okay...


Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_DORMITORY_02
I-It won't come in through the window, right...?


Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_DORMITORY_03
Sorry, I know this is sudden and you were sleeping... I promise I'll explain later.


Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_DORMITORY_04
Wait, are you trying to escape from the window...? You can't do that!

------



Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_TUTORIAL_01
I wonder how far we can get without losing contact with Kirijo-senpai...


Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_TUTORIAL_02
Yo, is this really the school...? Like, no joke?


Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_TUTORIAL_03
But it'd be kinda funny if we were actually inside our classroom right now, huh?


Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_TUTORIAL_04
Whoa! These open on their own? Sheesh, that scared the crap outta me!


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_TUTORIAL_05
I'll support you as much as I can, but it's up to you to learn something out there.

Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_TUTORIAL_06
Not Used


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_TUTORIAL_07
Good, let's continue exploring.

Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_TUTORIAL_08
I can still sense some enemies around. Let's move on.

------


Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_MONORAIL_01
Hey, that's Tartarus, right? I guess it looks kinda nice from the distance, but...

Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_MONORAIL_02
Holy hell, we're real high up! I think I'm gonna hurl...

Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_MONORAIL_03
This place is so creepy...


Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_MONORAIL_04
I-It's too quiet here...

Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_MONORAIL_05
What's up with Junpei? Did something happen...?

Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_MONORAIL_06
Hurry! We don't have much time left!

Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_MONORAIL_07
I-If we don't stop this thing, the passengers— No, all of us are gonna be dead!

Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_MONORAIL_08
It's speeding up...!

Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_MONORAIL_09
Shit...! We gotta haul ass now!

Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_MONORAIL_10
Alright, bring on the big one!


Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_MONORAIL_11
Hey, don't get too excited and do something stupid.


Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_MONORAIL_12
Is it that stopped one right there? Looks pretty normal to me so far...


Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_MONORAIL_13
Junpei's not in this car, either.


Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_MONORAIL_14
I don't care how big it is, it's goin' down!

------


Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_NIGHT_SCHOOL_01
The school looks so creepy at night... C'mon, let's head to the faculty office.

Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_NIGHT_SCHOOL_02
Let's go meet the others at the entrance.

------


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_FUKA_RESCUE_01
...Akihiko and— ...aren't— ...this floor—


Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_FUKA_RESCUE_02
...?
Who's there?

Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_FUKA_RESCUE_03
Are you... human?

Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_FUKA_RESCUE_04
Can y— ...hear me? ...Please ans—


Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_FUKA_RESCUE_05
Is someone there?

Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_FUKA_RESCUE_06
Please, answer me...

Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_FUKA_RESCUE_07
What's— ...current loca— ...Reply immed—


Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_FUKA_RESCUE_08
Where am I? Why am I here?
Please answer me...

------


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_THEURGIA_01
It's been a while since I've felt this kind of tension...


Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_THEURGIA_02
Think you can keep up after all this time?


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_THEURGIA_03
Believe me, I have no intention of falling behind.


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_THEURGIA_04
Then let's go!

Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_THEURGIA_05
Do you see any Shadows? They should be just ahead!

Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_THEURGIA_06
We see them. Let's take these guys down!

Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_THEURGIA_07
Time to finish this!

Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_THEURGIA_08
You're approaching a Shadow! Get ready for battle!

Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_THEURGIA_09
Let's head to the stairs that lead up, Arisato-kun.

Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_THEURGIA_10
Two Shadows left!


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_THEURGIA_11
We're halfway there. Let's stay alert and finish them off.


Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_THEURGIA_12
Only one Shadow left! You can do it!


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_THEURGIA_13
Last one, don't hold back!

------

Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_HOTEL_01
Let's hurry up and end this thing!

Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_HOTEL_02
Tonight, it's gonna be all me, baby!

Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_HOTEL_03
Come on, move it!

Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_HOTEL_04
Let's take it down before it harms any guests.

Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_HOTEL_05
Okay then! Time to head back?

Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_HOTEL_06
Dammit! I gotta do better...

Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_HOTEL_07
This operation felt way too easy...

Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_HOTEL_08
I suppose that's the end of this operation...

Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_HOTEL_09
Wait, seriously!? Where!?

Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_HOTEL_10
Huh? What're you talkin' about...?

Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_HOTEL_11
I'll go take a look around.

Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_HOTEL_12
So this isn't over yet...

Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_HOTEL_13
...Let's go!

Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_HOTEL_14
There was something weird about that mirror...

Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_HOTEL_15
I dunno what's going on, but we just have to smash the mirrors, right?

Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_HOTEL_16
We just need to break the mirrors, right? Let's hurry and beat this thing.

Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_HOTEL_17
So all we need to do is break the mirrors, correct?

Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_HOTEL_18
Something felt off when I stood in front of that mirror...

Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_HOTEL_19
Something off with the mirrors...? Dude, I honestly have no clue.

Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_HOTEL_20
Huh? The mirrors are different? How?

Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_HOTEL_21
Perhaps it'll be easier to find the difference by taking a closer look...?

Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_HOTEL_22
We need to break any mirrors that don't show our reflections.

Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_HOTEL_23
Uh, so which mirror do we break?

Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_HOTEL_24
If a mirror doesn't show our reflection, break it.

Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_HOTEL_25
Remember: break any mirror that doesn't show our reflection.

Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_HOTEL_26
Okay, let's go!

Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_HOTEL_27
This time, I got this in the bag!

Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_HOTEL_28
Ah, finally! Time for the main event!

Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_HOTEL_29
It's time for this operation to come to an end.

Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_HOTEL_30
Hey, I saw a big door back there. Maybe we should check it out.


Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_HOTEL_34
There was something weird about the mirror in the room that Shadow was in...


Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_HOTEL_38
Okay, Leader, you decide which mirrors we should break.

------


Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_MILITARY_01
Those two just now— No, worry about that later. The Shadow comes first.

Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_MILITARY_02
Damn, this place reeks. Like sewer cheese...

Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_MILITARY_03
Didn't think there'd be other Persona-users aside from us...

Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_MILITARY_04
Those Persona-users just now... Better exercise caution around them.

Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_MILITARY_05
Lucia couldn't sense them at all... Sorry, I'll concentrate on the Shadow.

Aigis - AST_DNG_MILITARY_06
It seems this facility was in use during wartime.

Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_MILITARY_07
Let's just take down this Shadow and get outta here!

Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_MILITARY_08
Huh? Why the hell are there tread marks?

Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_MILITARY_09
These tracks on the ground seem to be made recently...

Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_MILITARY_10
No time to waste. Let's end this before the Dark Hour is over.

Aigis - AST_DNG_MILITARY_11
These tread marks... They're new.

Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_MILITARY_12
I sense the target two blocks ahead of you!
It seems to be moving slowly downward.
Don't let it get away!

Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_MILITARY_13
This place...
It seems it was some kind of armory during the war.

Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_MILITARY_14
The target's gaining speed! It's continuing down the tunnel!
Hurry and chase it down!

Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_MILITARY_15
The target's stopped!
It turned around! It's waiting for us one block down!
Please be careful!

------

Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_RESERVE_01
The hell was that? He think that makes him cool or somethin', goin' out like that? Dammit...


Ken Amada - AST_DNG_RESERVE_02
How could he just...?


Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_RESERVE_03
I don't know what to think about it either... But we don't have time for that. Let's keep moving.

------

Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GET_ITEM_YUKARI_
Oh, did you find something?


Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GET_ITEM_JUNPEI_
Nice! We got something!


Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GET_ITEM_SANADA_
Hey, something fell out. You should keep it.


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GET_ITEM_MITSU_0
It looks like something fell out. We should take it with us.


Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GET_ITEM_FUKA_01
Oh, something came out. Maybe you can use it.


Aigis - AST_DNG_GET_ITEM_AEGIS_0
An item has appeared.


Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GET_ITEM_AMADA_0
Oh, something came out of that. I'll pick it up.


Koromaru - AST_DNG_GET_ITEM_KORO_01
Arf, arf!


Shinjiro Aragaki - AST_DNG_GET_ITEM_ARAGAKI
You wanna grab that?


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GET_ITEM_MITSU_0_2
Something fell out of the object you broke. You should take it, just in case.


Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GET_ITEM_FUKA_01_2
It looks like Koro-chan picked something up for you.

------


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_TBOX_STEAL_MITU_
It seems to be the type of Shadow that steals from the treasure chests. It's quite quick...


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_TBOX_STEAL_MITU__2
This treasure chest has already been looted. If only we could get ahead of that Shadow...


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_TBOX_STEAL_MITU__3
It's going after treasure chests. See if you can predict its next move.


Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_TBOX_STEAL_FUKA_
That Shadow got the treasure chest! Try to see if you can cut it off before it gets to another one.


Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_TBOX_STEAL_FUKA__2
It took the treasure from this chest too! Let's try another one...


Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_TBOX_STEAL_FUKA__3
The Shadow is going after all the treasure chests! Let's ambush it at the next one!


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_RBOX_MITU
It looks like there's a rare treasure chest on this floor. See if you can find it.


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_RBOX_MITU_2
I sense a rare treasure chest on this floor as well. How fortunate.


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_MBOX_MITU
There's a locked chest on this floor. If you can, try to retrieve its contents.

Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_RENEMY_MITU
I sense a rare Shadow. Try to find and defeat it.


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_ALLBAD_MITU
Hm... The Shadows on this floor are behaving strangely...


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_ALL_R_MITU
There are multiple rare Shadows on this floor. This is quite an opportunity.


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_ALL_S_MITU
This floor is full of strong Shadows... Stay on your guard.


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_DARK_MITU
I can't tell what's going on there from here, so be more careful than usual.


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_MDOOR_MITU
I'm sensing a distortion... It must be that door. It's dangerous, but may be worth exploring.


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_RBOX_FUKA
I'm sensing a valuable treasure chest on this floor. Please try looking for it.


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_RBOX_FUKA_2
Oh, there's a rare treasure chest on this floor too! That's lucky.


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_MBOX_FUKA
I'm sensing a locked treasure chest on this floor! We should probably try to find it.


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_RENEMY_FUKA
I'm sensing a rare Shadow. Do you think you can find it?


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_ALLBAD_FUKA
The enemies on this floor are acting strangely. Please be careful.


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_ALL_R_FUKA
There are a bunch of rare Shadows on this floor! Let's not let this chance go to waste!


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_ALL_S_FUKA
I'm sensing strong enemies throughout this entire floor! Please be extra careful!


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_DARK_FUKA
I can't see what's going on around you right now... Please be careful.


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_MDOOR_FUKA
Oh, I'm getting a reading of that door! Please make sure you're ready if you plan to go in.


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_MONADO_BATTLE_END
We did it!


Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_007_0
Found the stairs. Wanna head up?

Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_007_0_2
Oh! Stairs!

Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_007_0_3
Oh, can we go up those stairs?

Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_007_0
Found the stairs!

Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_007_0_2
Hey, it's the stairs!

Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_007_0_3
...We're goin' up, right? Then let's hurry and go.

Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_007_0
We heading up these stairs?

Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_007_0_2
So this is where the stairs were.

Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_007_0_3
Found the stairs. Want to climb up?

Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_007_0
Excellent, looks like we can head up.

Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_007_0_2
So this is where the stairs were...

Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_007_0_3
We've found the stairs. Let's go.

Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_007_0
Stairs located. Updating data records.

Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_007_0_2
A staircase. Shall we ascend?

Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_007_0_3
Oh, it's the stairs.

Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_007_0_4
It looks like this is our way up.

Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_007_0
We've found the stairs.

Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_007_0_2
There's our way up.

Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_007_0_3
Looks like we can head up.

Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_007_0
Arf!

Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_007_0
Looks like Koro-chan found the stairs.

Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_007_0_2
Arf!

Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_007_0_2
That's our way up. Good boy, Koro-chan!

Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_007_0_3
Woof?

Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_007_0_5
We've found the stairs. Koromaru-san wants to know our next move.

Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_007_0_6
Koromaru-san has located the stairs. He's asking if we're going up.

Shinjiro Aragaki - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_007_0
Found some stairs. Time to move on up.

Shinjiro Aragaki - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_007_0_2
So... we headin' up?

Shinjiro Aragaki - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_007_0_3
...That'll take us to the next floor.

Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DEFEAT_GK_MITU_00
The enemy has been defeated. Well done.


Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DEFEAT_GK_MITU_01
The path forward is open now. Keep up the good work.

Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DEFEAT_GK_FUKA_00
The enemy has been defeated! Great job, everyone!


Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DEFEAT_GK_FUKA_01
Now we can keep going. Good luck, and be careful!

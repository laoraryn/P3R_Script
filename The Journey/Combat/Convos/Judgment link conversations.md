Fuuka Yamagishi
Leader, can you hear me?
It seems there are multiple Gatekeeper types up ahead... We'll need to defeat them all.
I'm getting powerful readings from all of them, but we can manage... Right?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Of course.
We're gonna have to.
We're counting on you, Fuuka.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - You're right. I mean, we've already made it this far.
Happy - It's reassuring to hear though, Arisato-kun.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Yeah, you're right...
I believe in everyone's strength. I'll be strong, too.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Y-Yes, of course...!
Angry - Please leave navigation to me. It's the least I can do, after all.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Our goal is the summit of this tower. Let's take it one step at a time!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can sense everyone's strengthened
resolve as we head into the final battle...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Well then, please continue onward.
Make sure to be careful as you keep going, and don't push yourself too hard.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Aaaand there you have it! Ha, this is no problem for us!

Junpei Iori
Hey, hey, can ya hear me? Oh, cool, looks like we're already connected.
Happy - Yo, how goes? It sounds like you guys are on a roll.

=

Junpei Iori
Angry - ...Ryoji was saying there's no way we could win.
Happy - But the way things are goin', this'll be a cakewalk! Heh, I'm just kiddin', but it'd be sweet, though.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Don't get careless.
Well, we'll see.
It just might be a cakewalk.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Don't worry, man. I'm not takin' it lightly. I'm just bein' confident, y'know?
Happy - Better to think you can do it than to think you can't, right?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Ha, yeah, fair enough. We're goin' up against a legit monster, aren't we?
Happy - But still, better to be confident so the nerves don't get the best of us, right?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Heheh, even after all that doom and gloom about how we're gonna lose, you're not even fazed.
Happy - You're somethin' else, man. You might even give me a run for my money over who's MVP!

Junpei Iori - DESC_007_1_0_1
Scheming - Don't get me wrong, I know he was serious when he said we couldn't beat Nyx.
Happy - So I'm gonna laugh my ass off when we prove him wrong!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can sense everyone's strengthened
resolve as we head into the final battle...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Alright, let's keep goin'! I'm gonna nail it in the next battle, too!

=

Junpei Iori
Happy - Alright, people, all the best to ya! If you're in a pinch, you know who to call!

Ken Amada
Happy - Great. Now we're one step closer to ending this.

=

Ken Amada
Arisato-san, can you hear me?
Happy - Good job taking down the Gatekeeper!

=

Ken Amada
As we get closer to the top, I keep thinking about a lot of things.
I wonder if this is how heroes feel right before the season finale.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah, maybe.
It's not exactly the same...
No idea.

Ken Amada
In that sense, it's quite an experience, isn't it?
I never expected my daydreams to become reality...

Ken Amada
Happy - Haha, sorry. Don't worry, I know that, in their case, they're only acting.
I just thought it might help to think of ourselves as "heroes," or something.

Ken Amada
Oh, please don't get me wrong. I know it's only fiction.
I just thought it might help me think more positively if I put myself in a hero's shoes.

Ken Amada
Angry - You know... heroes aren't strong because they never lose.
Angry - They're strong because they never give up. That's what I think, at least.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can sense everyone's strengthened
resolve as we head into the final battle...

Ken Amada
According to Fuuka-san, there are still a lot of Gatekeepers before we reach the top.
Happy - But we'll make it for sure. Let's all keep doing our best!

=

Ken Amada
According to Fuuka-san, there are still a lot of Gatekeepers before we reach the top.
Happy - But we'll make it for sure. And I'm ready to go anytime!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Excellent, now we can proceed. Let's keep going.

=

Mitsuru Kirijo
Well done on that victory. Keep up your diligence.

=

Mitsuru Kirijo
We're coming up on the 250th floor. We've come quite a long way...
It hasn't even been a full year since most of you joined SEES. You've all done wonderfully.
Sad - I can't thank you enough for putting up with everything despite what you've had to go through.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Don't mention it.
You owe me one.
Ramen's on you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - *chuckle* That's quite generous of you. Thank you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - That's very true. Though it's not a debt I'm sure I'll ever be able to fully repay.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - Ramen? Why something so simple? You could always— ...No, you're absolutely right.
Happy - We've been fighting this whole time to return to a normal life, after all.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...Those that we've lost are with us now in spirit.
We will win. Everyone's future is in our hands.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can sense everyone's strengthened
resolve as we head into the final battle...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Very angry* - All right, let's keep dispatching the Gatekeepers just like that.
Very angry* - There are still five left... Let's stay sharp.

=

Mitsuru Kirijo
Very angry* - All right, keep dispatching the Gatekeepers just like that.
Very angry* - There are five left, so stay sharp. I'll also be prepared on my end, in case you need me.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Good job, everyone.
Just a bit more to the top. Please be carefu—

Koromaru
Arf!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Exasperated* - What's wrong, Koro-chan? Is there something you want to tell us?

=

Fuuka Yamagishi
Exasperated* - Oh, it looks like Koro-chan wants to tell us something.
What is it, Koro-chan?

=

Koromaru
Arf, arf!
Arf arf! Arf!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I feel a strong sense of
urgency from Koromaru...
It seems like he's encouraging us.

Koromaru
Ruff!

Minato Arisato - Selection
We're counting on you, too.
You get a treat after this.
Woof, woof, woof!

Koromaru
Happy - Arf!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Koromaru appears even
more motivated now.
I can sense everyone's strengthened
resolve as we head into the final battle...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - *chuckle* All set, Koro-chan? Then let's keep moving!

Koromaru
Arf, arf!

Akihiko Sanada
Heh, no problem. The end is just about in sight now.

=

Akihiko Sanada
Good work with that fight. We should be getting close to the finish line now...

=

Akihiko Sanada
You've fought your fair share of battles at this point.
Any time you're in a slump, just remember all the blood and sweat you put into this.

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's deep.
I haven't sweat that much.
That stuff's irrelevant.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Well, I hope it keeps you motivated.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - True, you always seem to keep your cool.
But we all know how much work you've put in.

Akihiko Sanada
Hm... Are you saying perseverance alone won't cut it against our opponent?
Well, that may be true, but I still believe in the skills that we got through that perseverance.

Akihiko Sanada
Anyway, bottom line is I don't want to have any regrets.
I'll do my job to the best of my ability, so you keep it up too, Leader.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can sense everyone's strengthened
resolve as we head into the final battle...

Akihiko Sanada
Scheming - All right, onto the next one. Let's keep this energy going.

=

Akihiko Sanada
Sorry for interrupting in the middle of your streak. Keep doing what you're doing.
Scheming - There's no point holding back from here on out, so give it your all! I'm ready too, anytime.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Whew, we're almost there, right?

Yukari Takeba
Hey, can you hear me?
Happy - You're doing great! You're almost there!

=

Yukari Takeba
So, um... I know this goes without saying, but let's make sure we win this, okay?
It's just... we have so many great memories together, and we should keep making more, too...
Sad - Oh, sorry, uh... I'm being weird, saying all this stuff out of nowhere, huh?

Minato Arisato - Selection
It's not weird at all.
Yeah, weirdo.
Actually, you're like this a lot.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Oh, good! I thought maybe I was acting out of character, but I'm glad you're okay with it, haha.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Hey, knock it off! But yeah, it's kinda weird, haha! Still, that's how I feel, so I don't regret saying it.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - O-Oh, really? Well, I guess I am this way more when I'm with you...

Yukari Takeba
Anyway... I won't give up until the very end. Actually, no... I won't let there be an end.
So... here's to making more memories, Leader.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can sense everyone's strengthened
resolve as we head into the final battle...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - All right, let's get back to it. We're almost there!

Yukari Takeba
Happy - All right, I'll let you get back to it. You're almost there! You got this!

Aigis
Good job, everyone! Now there's only one more left... We're very close.

=

Aigis
Good job, everyone! Now there's only one more left... You're very close.

=

Aigis
Sad - To be honest... I was a little worried.
Sad - I thought my desire for the ones close to me to avoid pain may result in my inability to fight.
Happy - However, the opposite seems to be the case. I feel a stronger motivation to fight than before.

Minato Arisato - Selection
That's called "courage."
How interesting.
You're very reliable.

Aigis
Happy - Oh, so this is courage! I suppose everyone has felt this all this time...

Aigis
Happy - Indeed. But I'm sure you have all felt this ever since you first decided to fight.

Aigis
Happy - Yes, please feel free to rely on me anytime.

Aigis
Happy - I will embrace this new feeling and continue to fight alongside everyone.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can sense everyone's strengthened
resolve as we head into the final battle...

Aigis
Angry - Now then, let's go. Our opponent is waiting for us.

Aigis
Happy - Well, stay safe and good luck. And remember, I am always ready at a moment's notice.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - The Gatekeeper's signal just went down!
Happy - We did it! That was the last one!

Minato Arisato - Selection
It's about time.
Now just the real battle.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I agree. It's been one harsh battle after another...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Yes, you're right. We're almost at our goal...

Fuuka Yamagishi
But now that the Gatekeepers are out of the way, our path is clear.
...I sense an area with no outer wall a little higher up.
Angry - That's probably the place Ryoji-kun was talking about...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Let's go, all of us, together!

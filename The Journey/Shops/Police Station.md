Officer Kurosawa


Something for you.


I've got something for you today. Consider it restitution for you and the others for working diligently every day.
-Kurosawa


Come by the station.


I have something for you. Come by whenever it's convenient for you.
-Kurosawa

Looks like there's a good deal today.
Should I go to the police station...?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Go
Don't go

DEV: Internal MES
UNUSED

DEV: Internal MES - MND_003_0_0
Looks like there's something for me at the
police station. Should I go there now...?

DEV: Internal MES - MND_004_0_0
I've already taken care of this. Should I go
to the police station again anyway...?

Officer Kurosawa
Not Used


Officer Kurosawa
All Valuables in your possession will be sold.

Officer Kurosawa
All done here?


Officer Kurosawa
Hm? You finished?


Officer Kurosawa
Come back when you need to.

Officer Kurosawa
See ya.

Officer Kurosawa
If you want to buy anything, you know where to find me. Drop by anytime.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Keep shopping
Exit

Officer Kurosawa
Now, then... I don't have that much, but you should be able to find what you need.

Officer Kurosawa
I don't have that much, but you should be able to find what you need.

Officer Kurosawa
Running a little sale today. See if anything catches your eye.

Officer Kurosawa
Don't worry, I won't ask what you want any of this for.
I just do what I think is right.

Officer Kurosawa
I'm ashamed to admit it, but there isn't much we adults can do for you when it really counts.
Now, then... I don't have that much, but you should be able to find what you need.

Officer Kurosawa
This is all I can do for you right now, but don't you be reckless, ya hear?
Now, then... Take your time.

Officer Kurosawa
Some people with Apathy Syndrome have suddenly returned to normal.
I don't know how it happened, but I do know you guys did it.
You have my thanks, too. I gotta tip my hat to ya—you guys are impressive.

Officer Kurosawa
The number of people infected with Apathy Syndrome seems to be increasing...
I thought it would decrease, but I guess that was just wishful thinking...
We could be in for the long haul, so feel free to get prepped here.

Officer Kurosawa
Those girls from your school who had Apathy Syndrome seem to have regained their senses.
I'm guessing you all had a hand in that, too.
Now, then... Is there anything you need?

Officer Kurosawa
Lately, there's been an increase in Apathy Syndrome cases among pairs of men and women.
That's all I know, but could there be a reason for it?
In any case, feel free to take a look around if you need anything.

Officer Kurosawa
Those Apathy Syndrome cases in pairs came to an abrupt halt.
Some have even regained consciousness. I'm sure you've all been at it again.
So, what can I get you today?

Officer Kurosawa
Apathy Syndrome may be on the decline, but people are still on edge.
I mean, who can blame them? Rumors spread, and the media fans the flames.
Anyway... Pick what you like.

Officer Kurosawa
Apathy Syndrome may be a serious issue, but the people panicking over it are also a handful.
The world is always like that. Powerlessness is a knave.
Well... Take your time and look around.

Officer Kurosawa
There's been another spike in Apathy Syndrome cases. The entire city is in a panic.
It's times like these when the police need to step up, but the reality is we've got no recourse.
In any case... take your time and browse.

Officer Kurosawa
You know your buddy, the kid with the hat? Iori, was it?
He seemed real down about something. Did something happen?
Well, anyway... What'll you take today?

Officer Kurosawa
There's been a lotta talk about Apathy Syndrome both online and in the news lately.
The rumors have gotten out of hand. Some say it's contagious, others insist it's a foreign conspiracy...
Well, I'm just going to do what I can.

Officer Kurosawa
I heard about the incident. What a terrible thing to happen...
You guys are putting your lives on the line, and I can only gripe about my ineptitude...
At the very least, I want to do what I can to help you out.

Officer Kurosawa
I hear this is gonna be the last stand.
Well, then... prepare yourself as much as possible.
Don't die out there...

Officer Kurosawa
Seeing as you're here, I take it things aren't over yet.
With the Kirijo Group in the state they're in, there's no telling how things will turn out.
All I can do right now is fulfill my duties.

Officer Kurosawa
I won't pry for details, but I know something happened to you guys.
Don't dwell on it for too long. No one blames you.
This is all I can do for you, but I don't want you pushing yourselves too hard.

Officer Kurosawa
The look on your face tells me you're ready to finish off one last big job.
No matter what you're up against, I have faith you can pull this off.
Spare no preparation and make sure you come back alive.

Officer Kurosawa
You'd best be equipped for all contingencies. It's anyone's guess what could happen.
If there's anything you don't need, I can take it off your hands.

Officer Kurosawa
There's still more...

Officer Kurosawa
The missing person's family sent a thank-you letter.
Take this, too.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
That reminds me, didn't that supposed Santa
tell me to do something good for the world?
Maybe I should show him this letter...

Officer Kurosawa
...You're here. Take this envelope.
Hm? Oh, it's something that missing schoolgirl brought in as a reward to the one who found her.
There was a lot about the case that stymied us on the force, so I figured you guys were involved.

Officer Kurosawa
...This money is from the salaryman who went missing.
I couldn't make out the full picture from questioning him, but you're the ones who saved him, right?
The police can't accept gifts, so this is yours. Use it wisely.

Officer Kurosawa
They found that missing girl the other day. I tried questioning her, but...
Her answers didn't make any sense. She said some kids saved her from an attack by a black thing...
She left a reward with us, so I'll hand it over to you.

Officer Kurosawa
I've got something for you, so here you go.
It's a token of gratitude the missing housewife left with us a short while ago.
You rescued her, right? I won't ask questions. Just take it.

Officer Kurosawa
They found that missing schoolboy the other day. I tried questioning him, but...
His answers didn't make any sense. He said some kids saved him from an attack by a black thing...
He left a reward with us, so I'll hand it over to you.

Officer Kurosawa
Here, take this envelope.
It's a token of gratitude the missing housewife left with us a short while ago.
You rescued her, right? I won't ask questions. Just take it.

Officer Kurosawa
See those rocks with the strange patterns on them? The man they found the other day left them.
I'm fine with one or two, but this many just gets in the way of our work.
...You saved him, didn't ya? Just go ahead and take them all.

Officer Kurosawa
They found that missing office lady the other day. I tried questioning her, but...
She wasn't making any sense. She said some kids saved her from an attack by a black thing...
She left a reward with us, so I'll hand it over to you.

Officer Kurosawa
For some reason, we just got a delivery of a bunch of mysterious dolls... You know anything about this?
......
Your face says you do. Just take them...

Officer Kurosawa
They found that missing schoolgirl the other day. I tried questioning her, but...
Her answers didn't make any sense. She said some kids saved her from an attack by a black thing...
She left a reward with us, so I'll hand it over to you.

Officer Kurosawa
They found a missing person the other day... Oddly, he handed over a big wad of cash.
Seems he was the president of some company. He was pretty damn low-profile for someone so self-important.
...Anyway, the police can't accept reward money, so you can have it.

Officer Kurosawa
They found that grade school kid the other day.
She brought this here as a way of saying, "Thanks."
Here, it's all yours.

Officer Kurosawa
They found that missing guy the other day. I tried questioning him, but...
His answers didn't make any sense. He said some kids saved him from an attack by a black thing...
He left a reward with us, so I'll hand it over to you.

Officer Kurosawa
They found that missing woman the other day. I tried questioning her, but...
Her answers didn't make any sense. I'm guessing her memory's fuzzy.
At any rate, she left this as a token of her appreciation, so I think you should have it.

Officer Kurosawa
Take this box. Something tells me it's for you.
It's a token of gratitude the missing salaryman left with us.
You rescued him, right? I won't ask questions. Just take it.

Officer Kurosawa
They found that missing woman the other day. I tried questioning her, but...
Her answers didn't make any sense. She said some kids saved her from an attack by a black thing...
She left a reward with us, so I'll hand it over to you.

Officer Kurosawa
This is a token of gratitude the woman who was missing brought us, but...
......
These coins look awfully pricey. Kids today sure are loaded...
Whatever. You guys saved her, so they're yours.

Officer Kurosawa
Take this box. Something tells me it's for you.
Hm? Oh, it's something that missing woman brought in as thanks to the one who found her.
You rescued her, right? I won't ask questions. Just take it.

Officer Kurosawa
Will you take a look at this for me?
The girl they found the other day brought this in as a gift...
It looks like... some sort of liquid. By the looks of the container, I'm guessing you're supposed to drink it?
She was murmuring something about fortune telling, so maybe it has something to do with that.
...Anyway, just take it. We can't have something this suspicious at the police station.

Officer Kurosawa
They found that missing student the other day. I tried questioning him, but...
His answers didn't make any sense. He said some kids saved him from an attack by a black thing...
He left a reward with us, so I'll hand it over to you.

Oh, it's you. Is school over already?
...It's been a long time since we've just talked like this.
Sorry, I don't quite remember how things went down...
Well, in any case, the months are going to go by quickly.
Make sure you enjoy your school life so you don't have any regrets.

Officer Kurosawa - MSG_001_0_0
Oh, it's you. Is school over already?
The Apathy Syndrome cases have stopped, but trouble usually stirs in the spring...
You should hurry on home and study or something.

Officer Kurosawa - MSG_002_0_0
Be safe on the way home and don't get into any trouble.

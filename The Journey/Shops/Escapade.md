Hey, what'll ya ha— Uh, wait a minute. Aren't you a little too young to be in here?

Bartender   
What? You want a drink? You're underage, aren't you?

I'm just delivering it.   
   
Bartender   
So you say... Look, I'm busy here, and something like this could really get me in trouble.

Okay, how about this? Can you go around and take everyone's orders?   
If you do that, I'll bring a drink upstairs for him.   
   
Bartender   
Hey, what'll ya ha— Oh, it's you.   
You seem to come by a lot... Maybe I'll hire you if we need an extra hand.   
   
Bartender   
Hey, what'll ya ha— Oh, it's you.   
That monk's not here today. He doesn't usually come on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.

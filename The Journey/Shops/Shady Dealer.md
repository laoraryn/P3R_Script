The Information Gatherer


Security training website


You interested in training videos? I found this site with a bunch of self-defense courses for security teams.
This kind of stuff is supposed to be trade secret, you know—but I'm letting you in on this because you're my kind of weird.
If you're interested, come to Escapade.


Sites for weird ones like you


You're weird, so I'm sure you're interested in stuff like secret assassin techniques. I found a good site about it.
I also have some info on a waning forum site about history.
Sound interesting? Come by Escapade and I'll let you in on it all.


Online forum discovered


I found an interesting online forum all about ninjas and their skills.
If you're interested, ninja stealth your way over to Escapade.


Legit matchmaking site


Have you seen the rumors online about a popular new matchmaking site? It requires payment, but it supposedly really works.
I'm sure a high school student like you would be all over that stuff, so I'll graciously share my info with you.
If you want to check it out, come to Escapade.


Intriguing blog


It's been a while since I found a personal blog this intriguing...
This is just the kind of thing an oddball like you would be into. You'll want to cradle a tomato after you read it.
If you don't know what I'm talking about, get over to Escapade, pronto.

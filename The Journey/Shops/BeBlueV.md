Yukari Takeba
Hey. So, I'm here, but, uh...

Yukari Takeba
Isn't this the place that claims to "cleanse your soul" with healing stones or whatever?

Yukari Takeba
Hmm... Sounds kinda sketchy to me, but... if you say it's okay, I guess I'll give it a shot.

Yukari Takeba
Are you a fan of this place, Arisato-kun?

Yukari Takeba
I have to admit, it's not bad. I always feel refreshed after coming here.

Yukari Takeba
Wow... I actually slept pretty well there...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - You know what? I wouldn't mind coming back once in a while. I actually feel pretty good!

Yukari Takeba
Well, while I'm here, I'm gonna do some shopping. I'll see you later, 'kay?

Yukari Takeba
I had a nice nap this time too.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - My mind feels clearer now, even! And I think I'll stop by somewhere again before heading back...

Yukari Takeba
Well, see you later!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's almost nighttime... I should
head back to the dorm.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's getting late... I should
head back to the dorm.

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
What a wacky store, huh? Somethin' about, "Cleanse your soul and face your inner self"?

Junpei Iori
I don't really get it, but it sounds kinda cool.

Junpei Iori
...Guess I'll give it a try. I wonder what my "inner self" is like...

Junpei Iori
This place again, huh?

Junpei Iori
Well, I did get some good sleep in last time, so... alright.

Junpei Iori
Man, I slept like a log! I seriously don't remember anything...

Junpei Iori
Happy - But I feel super refreshed! I feel like I can do anything right now!

Junpei Iori
Oh, I'm gonna go try my luck at the arcade! See ya later, man!

Junpei Iori
*yawn* What a nap...

Junpei Iori
I was dead asleep again. But, uh... am I really facing my "inner self" like this?

Junpei Iori
Well, whatever. I'm feelin' great, so I'm gonna try to set some high scores at the arcade!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's almost nighttime... I should

===============================================================================================

Akihiko Sanada
Hey. It's not often that you ask to meet like this. So, what is this store?

Akihiko Sanada
The staff said, "This treatment will help you face your inner self"...

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Well, you never know till you try. I'll give it a go.

Akihiko Sanada
Oh, this place again?

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Well, that's fine with me. I'll face my inner self for sure this time.

Akihiko Sanada
...I didn't realize that I fell asleep until I woke up.

Akihiko Sanada
I feel rejuvenated, but... I don't feel like I fully faced my inner self...

Akihiko Sanada
...Well, while I'm feeling good, I might as well get a quick run in. All right, I'm off.

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - ...I failed again. I slept through the whole thing this time too...

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - But I'm feeling pretty good for some reason. I better take advantage of this and get to training.

Akihiko Sanada
I'm gonna head off and jog home. I'll see you later.

===============================================================================================

Mitsuru Kirijo
I came here since you asked me to, but... what is this place?

Mitsuru Kirijo
"Cleanse your soul. Face your inner self." That's quite a slogan...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Well, seeing is believing, I suppose...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Apologies, I got held up. We're visiting this shop again?

Mitsuru Kirijo
This time... I wonder if I'll be able to get in touch with my "inner self."

Mitsuru Kirijo
I can't believe I fell asleep...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I can't remember what I was doing, but... it doesn't feel so bad.

Mitsuru Kirijo
At any rate, it's time for me to head back now. Don't stay out too late yourself.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I fell asleep again... As per usual, I'm not quite sure how well it worked either.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - But, surprisingly, I feel great. I've never felt this way before.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I have to head back to the dorm soon. Don't stay out too late.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's almost nighttime... I should

Aigis
I apologize for making you wait. Is this store the location of our business today?

Aigis
According to my data, the services here are capable of making one "face" their "inner self."

Aigis
Is there truly a distinction to be made between one's inner and outer selves? I will investigate.

Aigis
Thank you for waiting. Hm, this shop has quite a mysterious feel to it...

Aigis
I have heard that undergoing a treatment here will help you face your inner self.

Aigis
I wonder what exactly that means... I am curious to try it out.

Aigis
Thank you for waiting. I see that we will be continuing our research on this facility today.

Aigis
I will put forth greater effort to remain operational this time. Let us commence.

Aigis
Sorry for making you wait. Oh, were you planning to utilize this store's service again?

Aigis
In that case, I'd like to try it again, too. I hope I will be able to stay awake this time...

Aigis
I seem to have unintentionally spent the duration of the treatment in sleep mode.

Aigis
However, it appears that the results are identical to having undergone maintenance.

Aigis
I shall return to the dorm at full throttle to confirm these results. Please excuse me.

Aigis
It seems that I fell asleep during the treatment...

Aigis
Happy - But, for some reason, I feel very refreshed. How mysterious...

Aigis
Hm... Maybe I should run diagnostics back at the dorm... I will leave immediately, then. So long.

Aigis
It appears that undergoing this treatment caused me to enter sleep mode again.

Aigis
Furthermore, the resulting effects resemble post-maintenance performance again as well.

Aigis
The reason behind these phenomena remains unclear... Regardless, I appreciate you inviting me.

Aigis
Oh, it seems I fell asleep this time too...

Aigis
Happy - But I woke up feeling as refreshed as last time as well.

Aigis
Thank you for inviting me again, Minato-san.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts

Koromaru
Arf!

Koromaru
Arf?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I need to help him with the paperwork
so he'll be able to use this service...

Koromaru
Happy - Woof! Woof, woof!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Koromaru looks pretty satisfied.
In fact, he seems to be glowing.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
He happily returned to the dorm.

Ken Amada
Sorry for the wait, Arisato-san! So you visit these kind of stores, huh?

Ken Amada
I was actually a bit curious about this place for a while now. I hear it helps you face your inner self?

Ken Amada
Happy - Honestly, it sounds a little shady, but I'll give it a try!

Ken Amada
Thanks for waiting for me. This place again, huh?

Ken Amada
I won't fall asleep for sure this time! Okay, here I go.

Ken Amada
One minute I was looking at a healing stone, and the next I was fast asleep...

Ken Amada
Happy - But my head feels so much clearer now. I feel like I could finish my homework in no time at all!

Ken Amada
You know what? I'm gonna do just that once I get back! Thanks for today, Arisato-san!

Ken Amada
I ended up falling asleep again before I even realized it... What on earth is that stone?

Ken Amada
Happy - Just like last time, I feel much better both mentally and physically. I wish I could stay here longer...

Ken Amada
But it's getting late, so I'm gonna head back. See you later!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's almost nighttime... I should
head back to the dorm.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's getting late... I should

===============================================================================================

Shinjiro Aragaki
...So whaddaya want?

Shinjiro Aragaki
This place looks shifty as hell. You really want me to do something here?

Shinjiro Aragaki
...Well, whatever. If you think it's worth a shot, I'll give it a go.

Shinjiro Aragaki
This place again?

Shinjiro Aragaki
...Fine, only 'cause you're askin'. Let's go.

Shinjiro Aragaki
I can't remember a damn thing...

Shinjiro Aragaki
But it wasn't so bad.

Shinjiro Aragaki
That took ages... I'm headin' back first.

Shinjiro Aragaki
I can't remember anything this time either...

Shinjiro Aragaki
But I feel kinda good.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Anyway... I'm gonna head out.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's almost nighttime... I should

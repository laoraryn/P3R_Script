Pheromone Coffee during my break...

with me, but I did my best to deal with him...

I dealt with housewives complaining that
the Pheromone Coffee has no effect...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I found an infamous bug and got rid
of it before customers noticed...

I offered my support to a coworker who
got scolded for messing up an order...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts

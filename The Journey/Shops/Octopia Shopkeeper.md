Hey there, kid. Haven't seen you 'round these parts before.   
Our takoyaki's lip-smackin' good! You'll be askin' for more before you know it!

Hey, come over here, young man!   
My takoyaki is both delicious and cheap! Only 400 yen!   
There's no octopus in it, but... try some anyway!   
   
Octopia Shopkeeper   
Thanks! Come again!

Oh, hey, it's you again! Thanks for always coming by!   
Looks like my takoyaki has completely captured your heart... or should I say, stomach?   
...What's wrong? You're weirdly quiet today.   
You do look really pale... You should probably go home and get some rest.   
It'd be bad for business if you ate my takoyaki and then passed out.

Hey, come over here, young man!   
My takoyaki is both delicious and cheap! How about some?   
...What's wrong? You're awfully quiet.   
Whoa, you look pale. You should probably go home and get some rest.   
It'd be bad for business if you ate my takoyaki and then passed out.

Go get some rest. Then come back and eat some takoyaki when you're feeling better.

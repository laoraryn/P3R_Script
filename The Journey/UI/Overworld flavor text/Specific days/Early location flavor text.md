Screen Shot Movie Theater...
Looks like they show a
different movie each day.
Maybe I'll come watch
one when I have time...

Someone seems to be
cleaning the restroom.
I better not disturb them...

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's a vending machine.
There are drinks I've never heard of
before. Maybe I'll buy some next time...

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
A map is posted above the ticket machine.
The dorm is located near the Iwatodai
station. No need to get on another train.

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
Posters of movies are lined up on the wall.
It looks like a different movie is
shown each day of the week.

===============================================================================================

It's an outdoor terrace café.
It seems stylish and mature.
I imagine it'd be too intimidating
for most high school students...

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
It's a mahjong parlor.
Cigarette smoke and a
nervous tension fill the air...

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
There's a bar at the bottom of
the stairs. I wonder if it's open...

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
There's litter everywhere...
It doesn't seem to be
very well-managed here...

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
Countless pamphlets have been
posted on the phone booth...

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
It's the elevator that goes up to
Iwatodai Station's ticket gates.
I should take the stairs up instead...

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
Looks like there's ongoing construction.
I wonder if they're redeveloping this area...
It seems dangerous, so I
better keep my distance.

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
Looks like construction for a building.
I wonder when it will be completed...

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
It's dark inside the manhole.
I wonder if they are doing some
kind of underground construction...

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
There's a map of the area
around Iwatodai Station.
There seems to be a wide variety of shops
at the Iwatodai strip mall near the station.

===============================================================================================

Wilduck Burger...
Their Mystery Burger seems
to be a popular item.
Maybe I should try it sometime...

===============================================================================================

Azuki Arai Sweets...
It seems to be a sweets shop. A pleasant
scent is drifting out the door...

===============================================================================================

Hagakure Ramen...
Their pork ramen with shoyu broth
seems to be a popular item.
It smells good. Maybe I'll try it sometime...

===============================================================================================

Wakatsu Kitchen...
It looks like a casual restaurant
with affordable set meals.
It seems healthy. Maybe I should
try it when I have some time...

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
MangaStar Net Café...
Looks like you can not only read manga here,
but also purchase computer software...
Maybe I should check it out sometime...

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Umiushi Beef Bowls...
The savory aroma of beef bowls fills the air...
Looks like it's packed with customers inside.

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It seems to be this store's mascot.
It's staring at something
with its big, round eyes...

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The used bookstore, Bookworms...
The sign says, "Closed for termite
extermination. **We will reopen on 4/25**."
Maybe I should come
back when they reopen...

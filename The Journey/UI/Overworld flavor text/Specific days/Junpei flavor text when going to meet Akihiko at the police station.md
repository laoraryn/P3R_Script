Junpei Iori   
Damn, that smells good! Man... Now I want takoyaki real bad—   
   
No! I won't be seduced by street foods. Not today... To the police station!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Let's go to the police station first, man. We promised Sanada-san, remember?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yo, you didn't forget about going to the police station, did ya?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It's not open yet.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Dude, this place doesn't even open until later...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - I hear drinking the Pheromone Coffee here can turn you into a chick magnet.   
Well, not that I need it! Anyway, c'mon, we gotta get to the police station.   
   
Junpei Iori   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Looks like it ain't open yet. What is this place anyway?   
Well, whatever. The police station is just next door.   
   
Junpei Iori   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
This is the place Sanada-san was talking about, right?   
Alright, wanna go in?   
   
Junpei Iori   
We goin' in?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's go in.   
Not yet.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - What, are you nervous? C'mon, let's just go in already.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Dude, let's go in. Sanada-san's prolly waiting for us.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Doing solo karaoke is pretty hot right now.   
Happy - I don't really get it. Is it, like, proving you're brave enough to do it? Anyways, police station time.   
   
Junpei Iori

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0   
This seems to be an antique   
store, but it's closed...   
The sign says, "Reopening on July 18th."   
   
Junpei Iori   
An antique shop? I wonder what they sell... I guess antiques, huh? That'd make sense.   
Anyways, the police station comes first.   
   
DEV: Internal MES   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
This place sells all kinds of stuff. If you need any kind of medicine, they probably got it here.   
Actually, I should stop by here after the police station...   
   
Junpei Iori   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Do you usually get the limited or the standard edition? Or both? For me—   
   
Wait, we can talk about this later. First, let's go meet up with Sanada-san.   
   
Junpei Iori   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
There's some pretty good games here.   
It's usually pretty crowded, though, so what games are open kinda depends on when you go.   
You can check it out after we're done with Sanada-san's thing.   
   
Junpei Iori   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Alright, alright! But after the police station, okay!?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Dude, it's right there! Can we just go to the police station already?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Dude, you passed the police station! Turn around!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Movies are cool 'cause they can teach you stuff that helps you mature as a person, y'know?   
They show a different one every day here. Why don't you drop by when you're free?   
Oh, but not now, okay?   
   
Junpei Iori   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Hey, the police station's not there!   
Surprised - And it's dangerous over there, so we shouldn't go there anyway!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Uh, you know how to get to Paulownia Mall without having to look at a train map, right?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hmm, they're showin' all kinds of movies, huh... Maybe I'll come by when I'm free...   
But now's not the time! C'mon, we gotta go meet Sanada-san already!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
This café's pretty fancy, huh? Pretty expensive, too...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, let's use the stairs instead. It'll be a workout... Kinda.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
They building somethin'? I wonder when it'll be finished.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Somethin' catch your eye? There are a lot of different shops around here.   
But we should head to Paulownia Mall first.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
They don't tell you what's inside the burgers here, so it takes some guts to eat them.   
Anyway, can we go to Paulownia Mall now?   
   
Junpei Iori   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Man, now ain't the time for sweets!   
We gotta get to Paulownia Mall!   
   
Junpei Iori   
People think this is cute, huh?   
I don't get it... What part of it is cute?   
   
DEV: Internal MES - MND_002_0_0   
It appears to be the mascot   
for Azuki Arai Sweets.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - The ramen here is sooo good... And something in it makes your skin nice and smooth too!   
Maybe I'll come have some after we're done with Sanada-san.   
   
Junpei Iori   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
They say some of the food here makes you smarter.   
If that's true, I'm gonna eat here every day... But first, we gotta get to the police station.   
   
Junpei Iori   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Dude, what manga is so amazing that you have to read it right now?   
C'mon, we have to get to the police station.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Seriously, man? How many times do I have to tell you?   
We gotta go to the police station! C'mon already!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
People think this is cute, huh?   
I don't get it... What part of it is cute?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The used bookstore, Bookworms...   
The sign says, "Closed for termite   
extermination. We will reopen on 4/25."   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sometimes you can find rare manga at good prices in places like this.   
Anyway, looks like they're not open yet, so let's head over to Paulownia Mall.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, I heard this is where you're supposed to pray to the "god of studies" or something...   
Anyway, you can pray later. Sanada-san's prolly waiting for us already.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Your relationship fortune? What, you got someone in mind?   
Fill me in after we're done meeting Sanada-san!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yo, apparently you can hear strange voices here sometimes.   
Happy - I can kinda see it. Just look at this place! I wouldn't be surprised if an Inari fox popped up.   
   
Junpei Iori   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Damn, this tree is huge! No matter how many times I see it, it's always pretty impressive.   
I bet it's been here since way before we were born...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Alright, so first we gotta wash our hands here...   
Hold up, we got more important things to do right now! C'mon, let's bounce.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, huh. There's a slide here.   
Happy - I used to play on slides a ton when I was a kid. Like, I'd run up one.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - I remember climbing all over this when I was younger.   
It was kinda scary trying to get to the top back then. Heh, doesn't look so scary now though.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Hey, look, a see-saw. Wanna hop on it for a bit?   
...Kidding! It'd be totally embarrassing if someone caught us playing on it.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Hm? There's a sign. What's it say...?   
Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Oh, I see... Yeah, no, I can't read it. Man, what language even is this?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - You know how there were those kids who'd build these gigantic sand castles? Yeah, I wasn't one of 'em.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
I used to practice flipping upside-down on one of these... But I fell on my head once. Never again, man.   
   
===============================================================================================

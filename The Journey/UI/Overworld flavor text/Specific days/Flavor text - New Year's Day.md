Wearing something like this on New Year's really makes me feel more put together.
Although the sash makes it... a little hard to breathe...

Go back
Stay a little longer

Mitsuru Kirijo
Planning on heading back?

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right. Let me know when you leave.

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Seriously, Junpei? Of all the dumb things you could say.
Anyway... It's nice that we get the chance to go out like this every once in a while.
Let's just try to stay positive and chin up.

Aigis
Happy - I drew a paper fortune, and it said "Great Luck."
Happy - I'm sure that means everything will work out for the best.

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
Wha— I didn't say that! Dude, don't go makin' stuff up!

===============================================================================================

Akihiko Sanada
I'm not used to seeing the girls dressed like that... Not sure why, but I get a little flustered looking at them.

===============================================================================================

Koromaru
Arf, arf!

===============================================================================================

Ken Amada
Huh? But you said...

===============================================================================================

Octopia Shopkeeper
Hey, come over here, young man!
My takoyaki is both delicious and cheap! Only 400 yen!
What, you thought you'd get a discount because it's New Year's? Just buy some! ...Please.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I buy some takoyaki?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Buy
Don't buy

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can't hold any more Weird Takoyaki.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
......
I don't have enough money...

Octopia Shopkeeper
What? You aren't buying any? C'mon...

Octopia Shopkeeper
Thanks! Come again!

Yo-Yo Fishing Stall Owner
Hey, kid. Here for your first shrine visit of the year, eh? I'll have to pay my own respects after work.

Yo-Yo Fishing Stall Owner
Today's yo-yo fishing is a New Year's version. Great luck if you catch it, worst luck if it breaks!

===============================================================================================

Mask Shop Owner
Hey, boy. Yer a handsome fella, aren't ya? You look just like one of my masks... I'm just kiddin'!

Mask Shop Owner
Masks are actually good luck items, y'know? Like this one, for example... Uh, where did I put it...?

===============================================================================================

Astonished Woman
I can't believe he got "Worst Luck"...
Maybe I should break up with him before his bad luck affects me too...

===============================================================================================

Bummed Man
I picked a fortune and it was "Worst Luck"...
That's a hell of a way to start the New Year.

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
Didn't you already pray? What, you think you'll have more luck if you pray again or something?

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
"Relationship fortune - 100 yen."
It looks like they're out
of tickets for today...

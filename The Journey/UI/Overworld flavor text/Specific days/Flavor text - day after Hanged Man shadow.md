Happy - We can finally get back to living a normal life... But, honestly, it feels kinda weird.
Happy - Well, let's just have fun celebrating tonight.
Happy - Oh, I gotta stop by the archery team. I'll see you later.

Yukari Takeba
Whew... I can finally concentrate on archery practice today.
I'll motivate myself with the sushi we'll be having to practice a little harder.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Woohoo! School's out! And boy, do I have a hankering for sushi tonight!
Happy - Just wait for me, my precious, beloved sushi. I'll be sure to come home hungry!
Sooo I'm gonna take the long way home to work up an appetite. You go on ahead without me.

Junpei Iori
Hurt - Ugh... God, I want a hamburger so bad.
Scheming - No! I gotta resist! My scrumptious sushi is waiting for me tonight!

Pubescent Student
Heya! Someone looks happy today. What's the occasion?
Wait, don't tell me you actually got a girl! Well, did you!? Come on, dish it out!

Indifferent Student
Parties are too much effort...
You have to think about a location, what to feed everyone, what activities to coordinate... Ugh. Just thinking about it makes my mouth dry.

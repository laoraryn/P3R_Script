Club Escapade... Looks   
like it only opens at night.   
Elizabeth is waiting for me at the Velvet

Chagall Café... Their Pheromone Coffee, with   
its enchanting taste, seems to be popular.   
They say it makes you more charming...   
but I should head to the Velvet Room first.

games that can be played without   
waiting are different each day.   
But for now, I should

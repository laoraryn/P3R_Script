Oh, it's the Dream Team. Sheesh, you guys are always together. What's up?
Hold on... You're not really going to Port Island Station right now, are you!?
Haven't you heard the reports!? It's super unsafe!

Student
My friend's friend's classmate was found knocked out in the back alley.
And your uniforms would make you stand out... You could get into some serious trouble there.

===============================================================================================

Angry Old Man
The hell you kids doin' out here this late?
You delinquents keep loitering in the wrong places, gettin' up to god knows what.
Whichever one of your gang wears the heavy clothes to cover his tattoos, tell him I got my eye on him.
Now, scram! I'll call the cops.

Angry Old Man
Now, scram! I'll call the cops.

Yukari Takeba
Hey, why're you trying to go back? C'mon, let's go.

===============================================================================================
Junpei Iori
Sad - Man... Goin' to a place like that this late at night? It's not so easy for a stand-up guy like me.

Yukari Takeba
Would you stop complaining already? It'll be nothing!
All we have to do is take the monorail to the station. What's so hard about that?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - That's not exactly what I meant by "not easy"...
Y'know, Yuka-tan, you might actually be scarier than the punks we're bound to run into.

===============================================================================================


Junpei Iori
Hey, we'd better just get going already or Yuka-tan's gonna chew us out.

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Hey! What do you think you're doing!?

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
Hey, let's take the front door like normal people, 'kay? Hurry up or Yuka-tan's gonna yell at us!

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
C'mon, you can watch TV after we get back. Let's go!

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
What, did you forget something in your room? You better not be trying to stall. Let's just go!

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
You really have to eat right now? We're about to leave! You can eat after we're done.

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Did you want to cook something? That might take a while, so do it after we get back.

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
Ooh, a classic stall tactic, eh?
...Yeah, I don't think that's really gonna work. Come on, let's just get this over with...

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
Oh, why don't you look up some, like, self-defense techniques real quick?
Actually... that probably wouldn't help much. Never mind.

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
This is that door that won't open...
If only it was the front door that wouldn't open. Then we wouldn't have to go...

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Seriously? Now's not exactly a great time to sit down and start a book. C'mon, let's go!

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
You gonna stuff a couple books under your clothes for protection? I thought about that too...

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
What are you doing over there? C'mon, let's get going.

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
That's just storage, man. It doesn't lead outside. You gotta use the front door.

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
You can check your mail later. Let's go already.

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
You ready to get outta here?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yup.
I want to look around more.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Cool! Let's get going.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Haha! Nothin' like bein' the new kid! Well, soak it all in, then. It'll be boring once you get used to it.

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
Oh, you wanna go this way? Uh, alright, then.

Junpei Iori
Alright, let's go.

===============================================================================================

Should I go back to the dorm now...?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Return to the dorm
Not yet

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
Oh, you need to take a leak? If you gotta go, you gotta go...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Use the restroom
Not now

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Dude, wait! You, uh... prolly shouldn't go in there...

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
The class rosters are posted.
I'm in Class 2-F.

Junpei Iori
Happy - I think our class's roster is pretty solid.

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
It's the faculty office. There's nothing
I need to do here right now.

Junpei Iori
Don't you get nervous going to the faculty office even if you haven't done anything wrong?

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
It's the library.
Looks like it's closed today. It seems like
a place where I could focus on studying...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Y'know, I've never even been in there once! I guess I shouldn't be proud of that...

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
It's the nurse's office.
I'm feeling fine now. Maybe I should
try coming here when I feel tired...

Junpei Iori
The teacher in the nurse's office is, uh... He's an interesting guy.

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
Exam results from the
previous year are posted.
It looks like this school posts the
exam results for all students.

Junpei Iori
Our exam results are posted here...
Sad - I really wish they didn't reveal everyone's results all out in the open like that...

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's the science lab.
There's a faint smell of chemicals. I wonder
if the lab is used for chemistry classes...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Ya think we could get rich if we did alchemy during chemistry class?

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
It's the janitor's room.
I bet the school is kept so
clean because of them...

Junpei Iori
There're a lotta people that work here besides just the teachers, huh?

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's the welfare practice room.
I wonder how much importance this school
places on subjects such as welfare...

Junpei Iori
I've never been in there before. Actually, I don't know if it's even being used.

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
It's the printing room.
I wonder if the documents that I used for the
admission procedure were printed here...

Junpei Iori
I wish they'd print the answers on the back of our worksheets or something...

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
It's the home economics prep room.
I wonder if there are sewing machines
and such to use for class...

Junpei Iori
There are a lot of these prep rooms. Well, I guess you gotta always be prepared, right?

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
It's the music prep room.
It seems like this school is
better equipped than others...

Junpei Iori
Instruments take up so much space... And we don't even use them that much.

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
These lead to the classrooms of other grades.
I probably shouldn't roam around randomly...

Junpei Iori
That's where the classrooms for the other grades are. There's no exit that way, dude.

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
It's a statue of a sword and staff.
It looks very well made. I wonder
what meaning it holds...

Junpei Iori
Happy - If the school were a dungeon, this would totally be a save point, don'tcha think?

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
A variety of products are
tightly packed together.
Maybe I'll buy something next time...

Junpei Iori
By the way, the lady will yell at you if you try to take something from the back.

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
There are sewing machines
and mannequin torsos.
I wonder if these are used during
home economics classes...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Oh, you interested in fashion? I got pretty good fashion sense too, don't ya think?

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
There are timpani and music stands...
I better not touch them without permission.

Junpei Iori
This stuff looks pretty expensive... Is it a good idea to just leave it all out like this?

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
Easels and canvas boards
are scattered about...
It looks like they're good quality ones.
I wonder if they're used for class...

Junpei Iori
Happy - I can never understand art. How 'bout you? Is there a secret artist in you?

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
It's Class 2-E's homeroom.
I wonder what kind of
students are in this class...

Junpei Iori
That's 2-E's classroom. I don't really know anyone in that class.

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It says, "Emergency Exit."
I shouldn't try to go outside from here...

Junpei Iori
Sad - Hey, uh... We should head out the normal way through the main entrance, okay?

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
It's the PA room.
I wonder if the school
bell is rung from here...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Should we broadcast my angelic voice? ...Heh, just kidding.

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's the computer room.
I have a computer in my own room
too. It would be nice if I could use it...

Junpei Iori
Are you a techie? Seems like it's normal to have a computer in every household nowadays.

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
These stairs lead to the
classrooms of other grades...
I should go down instead and
head back to the dorm.

Junpei Iori
That's where the classrooms for the other grades are. There's nothing for us there.
Happy - If you wanna go to the rooftop, you gotta use the stairs on the other side.

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
This is the student council room.
I don't have any reason to
go inside at the moment.

Junpei Iori
The student council room... When was the new president gonna be elected again?

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
It's the art room.
Looks like it's used for classes
as well as club activities.

Junpei Iori
Happy - This is where the art club paints n' stuff. Maybe I should get them to paint my beautiful physique.

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
It's the science room.
There may be dangerous chemicals inside.
I better not go in without permission...

Junpei Iori
There might be chemicals in there, so you prolly shouldn't go in.
Happy - I think the photography club sets up here. I wonder if there are any juicy photos inside...

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's the music room. It seems to
be where the music club meets.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Do you play an instrument? I play the guitar... a little.

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's the home economics room.
There's a poster with strange writing on the
door. What's this room being used for...?

Junpei Iori
Do we actually have home ec classes? ...Wait, why am I asking you?

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
A small tree is growing here.
I wonder why it's planted in this spot...

Junpei Iori
This is kind of a random place for a single tree... And what kinda tree is it anyway?

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
It's the whiteboard used by the sports clubs.
It seems to be used for posting club notices
and strategies, among other things.
I wonder if there are any clubs I can join...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Man, when I see something like that, I just wanna doodle all over it, don't you?

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
This gate is locked tightly. Is it
used by the school administrators?
In any case, I should use the
front entrance to leave instead...

Junpei Iori
Hey, I don't think we're allowed to use that gate.

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
Looks like this door leads outside
to the practice field.
The track team seems to use
it for practice after school.
...They're not recruiting new
members at the moment.

Junpei Iori
This leads out to the practice field.
It's pretty much just the track team that uses it. Apparently, it's top-of-the-line in terms of quality.

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
It's the door to the gym.
The kendo team seems to use
it for practice after school.
I better not interrupt them...

Junpei Iori
This is the gym. I think the kendo team uses it for practice.

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Looks like this door leads
to the swimming pool.
An indoor pool is such a luxury. I wonder
if you can swim in the winter too...

Junpei Iori
Look, we even have an indoor pool! Only the swim team uses it, though.

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
There are a lot of complex-
looking books lined up...
They seem to be about composition...

Junpei Iori
You think these are just Ms. Toriumi's favorite books?
Happy - They all look pretty difficult... How could anyone have fun reading that?

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
There are some manga mixed in among the
textbooks and other scholarly literature...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Maybe I should put some of my own manga there after I finish 'em.

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
The flowers seem like they're about to wilt...
Maybe no one is watering them...

Junpei Iori
Sad - Oh man, they look like they're about to die. That's kinda sad...

DEV: Internal MES - MND_001_0_0
The flowers seem to be doing great.
They look well cared for.

Junpei Iori
I don't really care about flowers, but it looks like someone really takes care of these ones.

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Looks like a storage shed. There's
nothing particularly interesting about it.

Junpei Iori
You can't go back downstairs through there. I know, it's confusing, right?

===============================================================================================

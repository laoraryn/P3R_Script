It's the men's restroom. Should I go in...?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Wait, really? At a time like this?
Angry - Just try to be quick, will you?

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Seriously? Again!? You're not doing this on purpose, are you?
Sad - Fine... But hurry up, okay?

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Hey, what exactly do you think you're doing? Stop screwing around!

===============================================================================================

There doesn't seem to be anyone
in the faculty office. It might be
a good time to enter...

Yukari Takeba
I don't think we need anything else in there. C'mon, the others are probably waiting for us.

Yukari Takeba
This side usually isn't open. We should enter from the other door.

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
The door is tightly sealed.

Yukari Takeba
I doubt the key would be in the library. Let's check the faculty office.

Yukari Takeba
We don't need anything in there. C'mon, let's meet up with everyone.

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
The door is tightly sealed.

Yukari Takeba
That's the nurse's office, not the faculty office.
C'mon, we don't have time to be wandering around.

Yukari Takeba
Hm? Are you feeling sick or something?
Well, no one's gonna be in there right now anyway. Let's just meet back up with everyone.

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
Now's not the time to look at this.

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Ugh, it's so dark... I hate this...
Let's just get to where we're going, okay? No more detours!

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - H-Hey, did you hear that!?
Um... I-It must've just been my imagination. C'mon, let's go.

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Hey, we don't have time to wander around. Let's get going.

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Hey, where are you going!? We're already inside the school, so we shouldn't just leave.

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
There's no turning back, okay?

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Why do you wanna go that way? C'mon, we shouldn't get off track.

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Is it just me or does this statue look creepier than usual? Maybe because it's nighttime...
Anyways, we shouldn't be wasting time like this. Let's get going.

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
You know you can't buy anything right now, right?

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
The classrooms are kinda creepy at night... Um, let's get going, okay?

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
The emergency exit is locked.

Yukari Takeba
Hey, that leads outside. We're going to the faculty office to look for the key, remember?

Yukari Takeba
Are you trying to leave? Or are you just lost? C'mon, everyone's waiting for us.

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Yeesh. The PA room at night is waaaay creepy...

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
You can use the PC back at the dorm. Come on, let's get to the faculty office.

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Hold on, we're going the wrong way! Let's head downstairs.

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
...Did you forget something in the classroom? Sorry. You're gonna have to worry about that later.

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
This is the long way around. How about we head back and take the stairs?

===============================================================================================

Yukari Takeba
Why are you trying to get to the roof? Come on, let's get back on track.

===============================================================================================

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0
It's the student council room.

Yukari Takeba
What's up? I don't think we have any business here.

===============================================================================================

It seems to be a vacant room.
The door is tightly sealed...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The nameplate says, "Iori."
Junpei doesn't seem to be in his room...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Junpei doesn't seem to be in his room...

Junpei Iori
What the hell is with this problem!? What language is this written in!?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can hear Junpei yelling and shouting...

Junpei Iori
Argh! What am I doing!? Dammit!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can hear Junpei yelling and shouting...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Junpei seems to be in his room,
but he isn't responding...

Junpei Iori
Dude, don't bother me. I'm tryna study here.
I don't get good grades as easily as you do, man.
Laters.

Junpei Iori
What the hell is this problem!? We never learned this!
Wait a minute... They must've taught us this when I was asleep! What a dirty trick!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can hear Junpei hollering...

Junpei Iori
Hey, what're you doin'!? That way's obviously a trap!

Ryoji Mochizuki
Are you sure? But there's a treasure chest here.
Whoa, a boss appeared! Junpei-kun, it's all yours!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Junpei seems to be studying.
I shouldn't bother him...

Ryoji Mochizuki
Oh, is that you, Junpei-kun? Don't worry about getting me a drink or anything!
But anyway, I pressed a button and the whole screen suddenly went dark...

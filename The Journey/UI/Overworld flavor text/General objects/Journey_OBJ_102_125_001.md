Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
There is a simple desk. On the   
desk is a cardboard box.   
Aragaki's belongings are inside the box...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The desk drawer is slightly ajar...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Open it   
Don't open it   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
...I found a familiar-looking   
envelope inside the drawer.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Inside the envelope is   
a single piece of paper...   
...!   
It's a document with the   
following written on it:   
"Reinstatement Form - Mr. Principal,   
Gekkoukan High School"   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It appears to be the school reinstatement   
form Mitsuru asked me to give him.   
The date and reason are blank,   
but there is a signature that   
looks like Aragaki's handwriting...   
   
Mitsuru's Voice   
...Is someone there?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
There is a simple desk. It seems to   
be the one provided by the dorm.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I pray at the Inari shrine?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'll pray.   
What else can I do here?   
Never mind.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I sense something...   
   
Otherworldly Voice   
Yip yip!   
   
Otherworldly Voice   
What is it? Did you want a card?   
   
Otherworldly Voice   
All right, I'll copy it for you. It's one of my hobbies these days.   
Choose a Skill Card that's to your liking.   
It's hard to choose just one if you have a bunch, so it's best to use them up. That way, you're carrying fewer of them around.   
Shall we do this, then?   
   
Otherworldly Voice   
...Hey, you don't have anything.   
I can't copy any Skill Cards for you if you don't have any in the first place.   
   
Otherworldly Voice   
What kind of Skill Card do you want duplicated?   
   
Otherworldly Voice   
Oh? Did you change your mind?

All right then— Wait a second, you can't hold any more of that card.   
Pick a different one, will you?   
   
Otherworldly Voice   
You've already duplicated a card today.   
Nobody likes pushy people... Besides, I'm tired.   
   
Otherworldly Voice   
Are you certain you want to duplicate the  card?   
   
Otherworldly Voice   
Well, here goes!

Whew, all done. Go on, take it.

Some visitors left Inari sushi as an offering.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I tried to put my

Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
There's some Inari sushi at the shrine, but   
I can't just steal someone's offerings.   
I should work on my .   
If I were at least , maybe   
I could think of another solution...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Come to think of it, Elizabeth said

The Inari shrine is quiet...

牛乳やスポーツドリンクが入っている。
誰かの買い置きだろうか…

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The fridge is stuffed full
of food and ingredients...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It doesn't seem like the
 will fit...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
There's nothing that belongs to me inside...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
There's a notice inside the fridge.
"Next fridge clearance date: **/**"
The fridge might have space on this date...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
There's a bit of space...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
My  is chilling inside...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I don't have anything I want to chill...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Come to think of it, I have
a ...
Should I chill it in the fridge...?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Chill it
Not now

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I put a  in the fridge.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I should come back and get
it **tomorrow or later**...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The  I put inside
here earlier is sufficiently chilled...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
...!?
The taiyaki I put in the fridge a long time
ago looks completely different now...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Looks like I left it in the fridge for too long.
I should be more careful next time...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The taiyaki I put inside here earlier is gone...
A note has been left in the spot
where I left the taiyaki...

Note
"To whoever had that taiyaki in here. Sorry, I couldn't help myself..."
"My bad! So here, I'll trade you some cup ramen. -Junpei"

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The taiyaki I put inside here earlier is gone...
...A note is in its place. Looks
like it's from the chairman...

Letter from Ikutsuki
"Dear Arisato,
I apologize for eating your taiyaki."
"I had bought the same kind, but I forgot that I had put mine somewhere else..."
"I'll make sure to buy another one for you. In the meantime, please accept this as an apology."
"P.S. I hope you don't find my love for taiyaki... FISHY."

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The taiyaki I put inside
here earlier is chilled...
There's something with a sticky
note on it next to the taiyaki...

Sticky Note
"To Arisato-kun. For all your hard work on your club activities! -Yukari"

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's from Yukari. I'll gladly accept it...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The taiyaki I put inside here earlier is gone...

"To Arisato. Sorry, I accidentally ate your taiyaki thinking it was for me."
"Take this in exchange. -Sanada"

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The taiyaki I put inside
here earlier is chilled...
...Next to it are some snacks
with a note attached.

Note
"I got these as a gift. Anyone can have them. -Aragaki"

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Looks like no one has claimed them
yet. I guess I'll take one for now...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The taiyaki I put inside here earlier is gone...
A note has been left behind instead...

Note
"I ate the taiyaki. It's probably yours, right Minato?"
"Taiyaki as a late night snack is the best! Thanks for chilling it for me!"
"Just kidding. Sorry for eating it. Take this instead and let's call it even, alright? -Junpei"

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The taiyaki I put inside
here earlier is chilled...
...There is a card tucked under it.

Card
"Dear Arisato-san. Merry Christmas from Amada."
"If you'd like, please take some of this chocolate too."
"Someone from the shrine gave these to Koromaru. But since dogs can't eat chocolate..."
"It seemed like Koromaru wanted you to have them, so here you go."
"(I took one for myself too.)"

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I'll gladly accept it...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The taiyaki I put inside
here earlier is chilled...
There's a note on a basket
next to the taiyaki...

Note
"To everyone in the dorm,
If you'd like, each of you can take one."
"I was given these by an acquaintance when I was taking my college entrance exams."
"Please remember to rehydrate while doing your own studying. -Mitsuru"

There are bottled drinks in the basket.
I'll gladly accept one...

Here's a little something for you."
"Let's get through January 31st no matter what! -Fuuka"

I'll gladly accept one...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I should remember to give it to Elizabeth
sometime **tomorrow or later**...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Come to think of it, Elizabeth
said she wanted a chilled taiyaki...
I should bring this  to her...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It seems to be a vacant room.
The door is tightly sealed...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Aragaki doesn't seem to be in his room...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The room where Aragaki used
to live is now empty...
...?
The door doesn't seem to be locked...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Enter
Don't enter

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The room where Aragaki used
to live is now empty...
Everything has been put away.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The room where Aragaki used
to live is now empty...
Now, only memories remain.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The room where Aragaki used
to live is now empty...
Come to think of it, Ikutsuki asked me to
sort the items that Aragaki left behind.
The door doesn't seem to be locked...

DEV: Internal MES
I wonder if this driftwood washed
ashore from a distant place...

DEV: Internal MES
Come to think of it, Elizabeth asked me to
get her something that feels like the ocean...
Elizabeth might be happy if
I gave her this driftwood.

DEV: Internal MES
I should take this driftwood home as
a memento of our trip to Yakushima...

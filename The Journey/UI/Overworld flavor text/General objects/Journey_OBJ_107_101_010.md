The white sand on the beach is so fine...
It feels nice underneath my feet.

Come to think of it, Elizabeth asked me to
get her something that feels like the ocean...
Elizabeth might be happy if I gave her
a pretty seashell from the beach.

Maybe I should bring back a pretty seashell
from the beach as a memento of Yakushima.

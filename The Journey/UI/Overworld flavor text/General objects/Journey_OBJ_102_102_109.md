Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
There's a computer on the desk here.   
I wonder if it belongs to someone...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I heard that anyone can use this computer...   
   
SYS_TUTORIAL   
Various computer software can be used on this computer to pass time.   
The resulting effect depends on the item you use.   
However, the computer cannot be used if someone else in the dorm is using it.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Looks like there are some   
pre-installed programs.   
...A package on the bookshelf has a   
sticker on it that says, "Free to borrow."   
Should I borrow something...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend my time   
using the computer...?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It's the computer I was told   
can be used by anyone.   
But I don't have any computer   
software on me right now...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The fan book came with a membership code   
that can be used on the official website...   
Let's take a look at Umiushi's website...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
As I recall, this site was shut down...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Today's the Promised Day...   
I should head to Tartarus...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Someone else is using   
the computer right now...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hm? You want to use the computer?   
Good timing. I just finished my own business. Feel free to use it.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I'm feeling lethargic... I should   
probably go to bed early...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hm? What is it, Arisato? Is there something you're trying to look up?   
That computer is for shared use. The Internet is back up, so feel free to use it whenever you want.   
I can vouch for its performance and capacity. You may also install additional software on it.   
...However, keep in mind that it's shared property.   
You should probably avoid installing the game that Iori gave you yesterday onto it.   
I don't know the details, but I heard that it keeps a record of your private conversations.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Right now, the Temperance Arcana   
may help me grow even more...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It seems my    
may not get any higher...   
Should I still spend my time   
using the computer...?

Use computer   
Never mind

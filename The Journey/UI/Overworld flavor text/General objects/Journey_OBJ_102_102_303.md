Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The nameplate says, "Takeba."
Yukari doesn't seem to be in her room...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari doesn't seem to be in her room...

Yukari Takeba
Oh, hey.
Sorry, but I didn't study at all over the weekend, so I'm getting it done now.
Maybe some other time?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari seems to be studying.
I shouldn't bother her...

Yukari Takeba
Sorry... I just don't feel like talking to anyone right now...
Anyway... I have homework, so...

Yukari Takeba
Hey... Sorry it's through the door, but can I ask you a question?
Is there something you believe in,
Arisato-kun?
Something that, even when everything is terrible, and you've been betrayed by everyone...
...It doesn't shake your conviction?

Minato Arisato - Selection
There is.
I doubt it.
I'm not sure.

Yukari Takeba
You're very strong... I wish I was like you...

Yukari Takeba
Yeah... It's a hard thing to find.

Yukari Takeba
Haha, sorry...
It's probably not really a fair question, huh?

Yukari Takeba
I apologized, but... I'm not sure it really got across.
It seems like... there's this wall between us.
Am I making any sense? ...Well, I'm gonna go study now...

Yukari Takeba
Sorry... I want to be alone right now...

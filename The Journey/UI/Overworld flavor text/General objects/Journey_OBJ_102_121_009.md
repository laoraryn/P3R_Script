Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's the heating and cooling unit.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It feels warm when I stand near it... Likely
because warm water is running through it.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It feels cool when I stand near it... Likely
because cold water is running through it.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's not turned on because it's a
comfortable temperature this season.

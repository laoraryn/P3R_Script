Igor
Welcome... to the Velvet Room.
I have been anticipating your arrival.
The time has come for you to wield your power.
My role is to create new Personas...
By merging multiple Persona cards together, they can be reborn into a new form.
One could call it a fusion of Personas.

Elizabeth
There is much hidden potential within your Persona abilities.
We've never had a guest show this much promise in the past.

Igor
Indeed... And by establishing Social Links, you may be able to create even stronger Personas as well.
Oho... This shall prove to be most interesting.
To that end, as you accumulate cards, please bring them to me.

Elizabeth
If you wish to learn more about fusing Personas in greater detail...
Then come "Talk" to me so that I may give you some hints.
I will assist you to the best of my ability.

Igor
My role is to create new Personas...
By fusing your existing Personas together, a new one shall emerge.
When a new Persona is created, it tends to be of a higher level than the ones that were fused.
However, Personas that are fused will be lost.
Since the process requires multiple Personas, you will be left with fewer in your arsenal than you had before...
Which powers will you forsake in order to gain new ones...? It is up to you to decide.

Igor
A Persona is the power of your soul, which thrives on the bonds you have with others.
Thus, it is only natural that Social Links affect the strength of your Personas.
If you have established a Social Link of the same Arcana as the Persona you wish to create...
Then that Persona will receive power from the Social Link and level up.
The amount of power it will receive depends on the rank of the Social Link.
In some cases, your Persona may even surpass your own level...
Do you understand now how important Social Links are to Persona-users?

Igor
The most basic type of fusion would be merging two Personas together.
Generally, Persona fusion exhibits predictable patterns depending on the Arcana involved.
By making good use of this pattern, you will be able to create a Persona of your choosing.
There are a number of combinations, however, that do not follow convention.
For example, when fusing Personas of the same Arcana...
The best way to learn is to experiment on your own.

Igor
Allow me to briefly explain the Conceptions that involve three or more Personas.
These fusions are a tad complex, you see...
They will only become available once you have obtained specific Personas.
Though it will take much time and effort, the Personas you can fuse will be well worth it.
Most importantly, Personas created through these Special Fusions cannot be acquired by any other method...
That in itself makes the endeavor worthwhile.

Igor
A new Persona born from fusion may at times be able to inherit skills from the composite ones.
In other words, it's possible to give a Persona skills that it could never learn on its own.
You should keep this in mind when attempting to create a powerful Persona.
The mechanisms of skill inheritance are not yet fully understood... but there are two key points I'd like to share with you.
First, the more skills the original Personas possess, the more skills the resulting Persona can inherit.
Second, different Personas have different strengths and weaknesses regardless of the skills they can inherit.
...Do keep that in mind.

Igor
Allow me to explain more about skill inheritance.
For each Persona, there are skills that can be inherited, and those that cannot.
I believe it will be difficult to inherit skills with affinities that are of the Persona's weakness.
But some Personas have fewer inheritable attributes than others.
Even more rare are Personas that can inherit any skill, although they do exist.
You will learn more, by and by, as you experiment with fusion.

Igor
Incense Cards have the ability to enhance your Personas' abilities.
These enhancements can be passed on to new Personas through fusion.
As for which cards to use and which abilities to enhance...
You will learn more, by and by, as you experiment with them.

Igor
I regret to inform you of this, but our powers are not perfect.
Although rare, there are times when the cards may be incorrectly positioned...
When this occurs, it may result in an accident.
The created Persona will most likely be different from what we anticipated.
Do forgive us if such an incident does occur...

Igor
Occasionally, a newly created Persona will emerge bearing something within.
I advise you to nurture it, as it will eventually produce an item that may be of great use to you.
Using the item without first raising the Persona will do you no good...
Therein lies hidden power that you may one day wield.
...Do keep this in mind.

Igor
Skill Cards let you teach the skills sealed within them to any Persona.
For example, if you were to use an "Agi" card on a Persona, that Persona would then learn Agi.
Even if the skill is one that cannot be passed down through fusion, it seems Personas can learn them via Skill Cards...
Also, if the Persona you wish to teach a skill already has eight skills in its current repertoire...
You will be able to choose which skill to discard.
I have also heard that Skill Cards can be duplicated somewhere...
...It would be best for you to learn about that yourself through trial and error.

Elizabeth
Personas emerge from the sea of your soul... And they are all recorded within the Persona Compendium.
Once you've obtained a new Persona, it will be automatically registered to the Compendium, no matter the method of acquisition.
Personas can be summoned from the Compendium at any time once registered, even those that have been released.
Please note, though, that there will be a fee for summoning a Persona from the Compendium.
Happy - The stronger the Persona, the more it will cost... Such is the way of the world.

Elizabeth
You may also re-register a Persona that had already been registered. This will update its records in the Compendium.
Let us know anytime you want to update the records of a Persona that you have trained.
...Oh, and no need to worry—there are no fees for registering Personas.

Elizabeth
Personas are like masks representing your soul. Depending on the time and circumstances, you can freely switch between them.
Things shall go more smoothly for you if you manage to make the most of your Personas.
For example, if you bring a Persona of the same Arcana as the Social Link you're meeting...
I'm sure that they, who don the same mask, will allow for a deeper bond to form.
Use this information wisely.

Elizabeth
Surprised - Oh...
As those are my personal requests, let us discuss them outside of this room.

Igor
Search Fusion will allow you to conduct a wide search on which Personas you can fuse.
With Search Fusion, you will be able to view a list of Personas that you can create from the Personas in your possession.
This way, you will be able to check and compare different combinations of Personas even if the end result is the same.
Other than that, you may also find it useful to check Personas that you have yet to encounter.
I hope you will make good use of it.

Igor
In rare cases, a Persona's skills may change during fusion.
Oftentimes, the skills will change to ones of similar level. However, in some cases they may even change to higher level skills...
Hopefully, luck is on your side and all goes well. I urge you to first give careful consideration before making an attempt.

Igor
As with all things, there are certain days where the unforeseen may occur more frequently.
The same goes for when we conduct Persona fusions.
Depending on the phase of the moon, skill changes and fusion accidents are more likely to occur.
Furthermore, the odds of the unexpected happening increase when repeatedly fusing Personas.
Do keep this in mind.

Elizabeth
Please choose what skills to inherit.

Igor
It looks like you are not yet at a high enough level to create this Persona...

Igor
You already seem to have that Persona.

Igor
You have yet to establish a Social Link that corresponds to this Persona...

Igor
The corresponding Social Link is at level 1. This Persona will receive at least some power from it.

Igor
The corresponding Social Link is at level 2. This Persona will receive at least some power from it.

Igor
The corresponding Social Link is at level 3. This Persona will receive a fair amount of power from it.

Igor
The corresponding Social Link is at level 4. This Persona will receive a fair amount of power from it.

Igor
The corresponding Social Link is at level 5. This Persona will receive a good degree of power from it.

Igor
The corresponding Social Link is at level 6. This Persona will receive a good degree of power from it.

Igor
The corresponding Social Link is at level 7. This Persona will receive considerable power from it.

Igor
The corresponding Social Link is at level 8. This Persona will receive considerable power from it.

Igor
The corresponding Social Link is at level 9. This Persona will receive considerable power from it.

Igor
Hmm... The corresponding Social Link is at level 10.
Without a doubt, this Persona will receive a tremendous amount of power.

Igor
Is this Persona acceptable?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yes.
Hold on.

Igor
Oh? It seems the  Social Link has blessed you with even more power...

Igor
Oh? This Persona seems to be harboring something inside...

Igor
I'm afraid it did not turn out as we expected...

Igor
Oh... This is a wild card.

Elizabeth
You'll need to summon from the Persona Compendium to continue.
Summoning fees amount to  yen. Would you like to proceed?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Sure.
Hold on.

Igor
It appears as though you do not possess enough money for that...

Igor
It appears you are unable to carry any more Personas with you...

Igor
There aren't any Personas you can fuse...

Elizabeth
You wish to register all your Personas, correct?

Elizabeth
The level is lower than it was previously. Are you certain you want to continue with registration?

Elizabeth
I'll only register the Personas that are at a higher level than before. Is that all right?

Elizabeth
Do you want to register this Persona to the Compendium?

Elizabeth
Do you want to register all selected Personas to the Compendium?

Elizabeth
I have registered its current stats in the Compendium.

Elizabeth
All of your Personas have been registered.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yes.
Register all.
Register all.
Hold on.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yes.
Hold on.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yes.
Hold on.

Elizabeth
This Persona will cost you  yen. Is that all right?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yes.
Hold on.

Elizabeth
Here is ****, as requested.

Elizabeth
Unfortunately, you appear to be rather low on funds.

Elizabeth
It seems you already have this Persona.

Elizabeth
It seems you cannot add any more Personas to your repertoire.

Elizabeth
This Persona comes from another, one who suffers a different fate from yours, somewhere out there...
Their immense power, dwelling within this Persona, will surely be a great boon to you.
Do you wish to summon it?

Igor
Oh? This Persona comes from someone who walks a different path from you, somewhere not here.
It embodies the strength of its original owner's ferocious heart... and will surely become yours.

Elizabeth
Normally, this Persona is one that exceeds the power you currently possess...
However, with the blessing of the Sun Arcana, it looks like you will be able to fuse it now.

It seems you've completed a request. One moment, please, while I check...

Elizabeth
It seems you've completed another request. One moment, please, while I check...

Elizabeth
Oh? It seems you've already completed this request. One moment, please, while I check...

Elizabeth
Please take this as your reward.

Elizabeth
Thank you for your assistance. Please, take these as your reward.

Elizabeth
Oh? It appears you've already completed it. Here, take this as your reward.

Elizabeth
Sad - I'm afraid you have missed the deadline for a request.
As they say, time flies. Please be mindful of the deadlines.

Elizabeth
Go ahead and take a look.

Elizabeth
Is there anything else?

Igor
Hm...?
Well, well...
It seems that you've discovered **every Social Link and formed strong bonds with them all**.
For you to have possessed this many bonds, you must have donned numerous faces...
With such an extraordinary propensity for change, perhaps you may be able to harness a greater power.
The power of infinity...
Take this with you.

Igor
I do believe you are now capable of summoning a particular Persona...
But what Persona shall be born of your bonds...? I look forward to seeing it myself.

Elizabeth
It's as if your presence emanates a far brighter radiance than before. Perhaps all your hard work is starting to show.
Here. It may not be much, but this is my gift to you. Please accept it.

Elizabeth
I can sense that the power growing within you stems from the bonds you have forged and nurtured since.
Here. It may not be much, but this is my gift to you. Please accept it.

Elizabeth
I can see that you are living quite the fulfilling life, between nurturing your bonds and striving for self-improvement.
This is less of a reward and more of a gift from me to you. Please, take it.

Elizabeth
I still cannot foresee the limits of your potential... I look forward to witnessing you grow even further.

Elizabeth
Oh my... You appear to have gained a new power.
I believe you called it "Theurgy"?
Now that you've become even stronger...
You should be able to battle more efficiently and exquisitely with your multiple Personas.
As you acquire more Personas to fill the Compendium, you'll open your mind to new battle stratagems.
I shall inform you when more combinations are available in the Persona Compendium.

Elizabeth
Welcome to the Velvet Room. I have something important to tell you today.
The number of Personas registered in the Compendium has increased significantly.
Happy - This is proof of all the hard work you've been putting in every day... It is truly wonderful news.
So in turn, I would like to offer you more of my help...
I shall reduce the cost of summoning a Persona from the Compendium. Consider it a little gift from me.
I hope you make good use of it.

Elizabeth
Welcome to the Velvet Room. I have something important to tell you today.
The Persona Compendium is now half-filled with registered Personas.
Surprised - At first glance, it seems like a lot, but to think we're only just halfway...
Once again, the potential you possess has left me in awe.
Now, to show my appreciation for all your hard work...
The cost to summon a Persona from the Compendium will be discounted even further.
I hope you make good use of it.

Elizabeth
Welcome to the Velvet Room. I have something important to tell you today.
There are only a few Personas left unregistered in the Persona Compendium.
To show my appreciation for your hard work...
The cost to summon a Persona from the Compendium will be greatly discounted.
To think, this Compendium, once so empty, is now nearly complete...
Happy - And you might just be the one capable of filling each and every one of these pages.
...I look forward to that day.

Elizabeth
Surprised - Oh? Would you look at that...?
Surprised - You've managed to fill out the entire Persona Compendium just now.
Surprised - As a resident of the Velvet Room...
It brings me much pride and pleasure to witness such a momentous occasion.
To show my sincerest appreciation for all your hard work...
The cost to summon a Persona from the Compendium will be lowered as much as possible, so long as my master is amenable.
You've made it this far, overcoming all odds and obstacles...
I'm confident you will be able to face whatever fate has in store for you...
So allow me to assist you till the very end.

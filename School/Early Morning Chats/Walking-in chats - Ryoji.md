Mornin'.
Hey... Have you talked to Mochizuki-kun at all?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Nope.
A little bit.

Yukari Takeba
Oh, okay. I was just wondering what sort of person he is.
He seems really, um... affectionate? Is that normal overseas?

Yukari Takeba
Oh yeah? You think maybe you could get along with him?

Ryoji Mochizuki
Why, hello, Takeba-san... Oh, and good morning to you, too, Minato-kun.

Yukari Takeba
Oh, hey. G'morning, Mochizuki-kun.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - Please, call me Ryoji.
Happy - You see, since I transferred here at such an awkward time, I was hoping I could get to know everyone better.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Oh, I see...
It must suck having to transfer schools so often.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Can't deny that. I should be used to it by now, but it's always hard to leave new friends. Gets a little lonely, you know?
Happy - So, how about keeping me company for a little while? Wanna grab a quick bite sometime?

Ryoji Mochizuki
Surprised - Yukari-san...? Hey, wait up!

Junpei Iori
'Sup, Minato?

Ryoji Mochizuki
Good morning, Minato-kun.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Morning.
This is an unusual sight.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Hey, you know, the two of you would totally get along.
Happy - He actually wanted to know more about Gekkoukan High, so naturally I had to share my wisdom with him.
Happy - Anyways, he's a real cool dude to hang with.

Junpei Iori
Happy - We just ran into each other earlier and started talking.

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - Thanks for helping me out, Junpei-kun.
Happy - Thanks especially for telling me who's in the "Top Ten Cuties of Gekkoukan High," too.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Shhh! Pipe down!
If Yuka-tan hears about this, my rep's gonna go down the toilet!

Minato Arisato - Selection
But I want to know, too.
Isn't it already rock bottom?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Ohoho! Look at who's showing interest all of a sudden!
Happy - Well then, I'd like your opinion, too. It's a very serious matter, see.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Dude, quit rubbing salt into my wound! I'm just an easily misunderstood fella, okay?

Ryoji Mochizuki
Happy - Hahaha, you two are pretty close, huh.
Happy - I hope we can also be good friends, too, Minato-kun, since we're both transfer students and all.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can hear people talking.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The first bell has rung.

Chatty Female Student
Hey, have you heard the rumor about, uh... What was it again? The bathroom?

Loud Female Student
That's old news. Besides, it's just a ghost story, not a rumor.
You're talking about that one girl, right? The first-year?
She stopped coming to school and just sits around staring at walls all day long.
Whenever her mom tries to talk to her, the only thing she says is, "It's coming... It's coming!"

Chatty Female Student
Is that really how the story goes? Eh, whatever. It's probably all made up anyway.

===============================================================================================

Loud Female Student
G'morning... Ugh, I always feel super sleepy waking up on Mondays.
And there's another special morning assembly today? Didn't we just have one last week?

Chatty Female Student
Remember how Kirijo-senpai gave that great speech last week?
Apparently, that got the principal really fired up, and now he wants to make a follow-up speech.

Loud Female Student
Seriously!? The heck? Why do we have to suffer just 'cause he wants to stroke his ego!?

===============================================================================================

Loud Female Student
Oh no! There's a test today! I didn't study at all yesterday because... I fell asleep!

Chatty Female Student
Come on... You don't need to lie about it every time.
Don't you think it's rude to people who really haven't studied?
Sure, it's nice to be smart, but you gotta be considerate of other people's feelings, too...

Loud Female Student
Whatever, quit being such a nag! I totally forgot five vocabulary words listening to you.
I spent last night cramming... and now I gotta memorize them all over again!

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
Hey, have you heard about that second-year...?

Loud Female Student
Oh yeah! The one they found lying in front of the school gate this morning, right?
Hopefully, she just ran away from home... But I feel like this is the start of something big.

Chatty Female Student
Yeah, there might be reporters and camera crews and stuff... I'd rather not deal with that.

===============================================================================================

Chatty Male Student
The Kirijo Group was on the news yesterday. Something about showing their true colors...

Loud Male Student
Kirijo...? Oh, the student council president?
I hear they're involved in a lot of things. Even this school's owned by the Kirijo Group, right?

Chatty Male Student
I wonder why a company that big decided to build a school...

===============================================================================================

Chatty Male Student
By the way, you know Mitsuru Kirijo? The student council president?
I heard she's gonna study abroad after high school. Probably to prepare herself to run the Kirijo Group in the future.

Loud Male Student
Wow, that's crazy. It's like she lives in a different world from us plebs.
But she's staying in a dorm, right? Why would a rich girl wanna live in a dump like that?

Chatty Male Student
Maybe her family made her? To understand how us ordinary folks live or something.

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
Hey, get this.
The other night, my boyfriend casually tried to take me to Shirakawa Boulevard on a date.

Loud Female Student
What!? No way! THAT Shirakawa Boulevard? Ewww, he totally had an ulterior motive.

Chatty Female Student
We just started dating, but I'm already getting creeped out... His head's always in the gutter.
Maybe I should dump him.
I don't wanna end up like those couples from the rumors. You know, the ones "found unconscious" somewhere.

===============================================================================================

Chatty Male Student
You know, our campus is actually pretty clean and new. I only noticed after my club had to visit another school.
My parents said that our school was rebuilt after an explosion ten years ago.

Loud Female Student
I also heard that the explosion wasn't the only reason...
Around that time, a lot of students suddenly stopped coming to school.
Maybe that's why they put up the new building—to start with a clean slate...

Chatty Male Student
Haha, what, you think there's a dark side to Gekkoukan High? You watch way too much TV.

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
Ugh... We have exams starting tomorrow. And they're cumulative, so it's hard to remember everything.

Loud Female Student
What if I fail again...? I really wish the school would stop posting our names with our scores.

Chatty Female Student
Right? It's embarrassing if we're near the bottom of the list... Smart people like Kirijo-senpai wouldn't get it though.

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
What is your class gonna do for the culture festival?

Loud Female Student
A haunted house! I bet I'll be stuck playing the ghost.

Chatty Female Student
That doesn't sound too bad. You can just show up and put on the costume. I actually need to practice for a magic show...
But I also heard a typhoon is on its way, and that it's a big one... Are people really gonna turn up?

===============================================================================================

Chatty Male Student
I heard there's a nasty typhoon on the way. You think we'll still have the culture festival Saturday?

Loud Male Student
Nah, I don't think so. The way they're talking, the typhoon's gonna be way too destructive.

Chatty Male Student
You seriously think it's gonna be canceled? Man, after all that work we put in preparing for it...

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
Someone in my neighborhood actually has those symptoms...

Loud Female Student
There are a few in mine, too... I'm scared.
They said on TV that it's not contagious, but I feel like it's a sign of the end of the world...

Chatty Female Student
D-Don't joke like that. "The end of the world"? There's no way...

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
It's finally time to break out the winter uniforms... They're so heavy, my shoulders hurt.
At least I found my lapel pin in the pocket! It'd haunt me forever if I couldn't find it.

Loud Female Student
My shoulders have been hurting lately, too.
Plus, I'm hearing weird voices... And I've also been getting headaches.

Chatty Female Student
Y-You're haunted!?

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
Is it just me, or are more people coming down with Apathy Syndrome lately?

Loud Female Student
My friend's brother's friend got it, too.

Chatty Female Student
It's starting to scare me.
And it's on the news every day now. Oh, did you see the special program they ran?
Apparently, Nostradamus predicted that all this would happen!

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
Geez... There's someone with Apathy Syndrome at my cram school, too.

Loud Female Student
I heard that this city isn't the only one affected. It's also happening in other places.
I wonder what's going to happen to this country...

Chatty Female Student
C-C'mon, don't say such scary things. I'm sure someone will take care of it...

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
Hey, have you talked to the new transfer student yet? Isn't he handsome?

Loud Female Student
Yeah, I have! Mochizuki-kun, right? He's so sweet and dreamy... Also, he looks rich!
I'm going for him for real this time!

Chatty Female Student
Th-That's not fair! I called dibs!

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
The school trip's tomorrow! Are you all packed?

Loud Female Student
You bet I am! I've got it all covered. Yukata, bathing suit, flashlight, snacks...

Chatty Female Student
...You don't travel light, do you?

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
I heard some people saying that Apathy Syndrome is nothing to worry about.

Loud Female Student
I heard the same thing. They're saying it puts people at ease, right?
You think it's some kinda new religion? I think I get what they mean, though.

Chatty Female Student
No way, are you seriously falling for that? It's all a scam!

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
Morning! It's cold today, but at least winter vacation starts tomorrow!
What are you gonna do with your New Year's allowance?

Loud Female Student
Haha, I didn't get mine yet!
But I want to buy a grab bag! I'm aiming for one with a purse...

Chatty Female Student
Ooh, me too! Hey, do you want to start waiting in line today? We could bring a kotatsu...

===============================================================================================

Chatty Male Student
Hey, have you heard the rumors about that cult?

Loud Female Student
Hey, don't call it that if you don't know anything about it. Besides, it's pretty much fact the Fall is coming.

Chatty Male Student
Oh... Well, nothing we can do about that, I guess.
By the way, about the homework for second period...

===============================================================================================

Loud Female Student
By the way... I wanted to show you this magazine that hit the stands today.

Chatty Female Student
Which one? Don't tell me it's an article about cults.
Everyone's been saying "The end is near" lately... What's up with that?

Loud Female Student
...Just read it. You'll see how true it really is.

Chatty Male Student
Oh yeah, my brother was invited to join that cult.
They approached him when he was at Escapade. Isn't that crazy?

Loud Male Student
Whoa. Didn't think someone all about salvation and stuff would be at a nightclub.
Guess they're everywhere these days.

Chatty Male Student
Apparently, the guy had a crazy look in his eye. He kept rambling about the "moment of salvation" or whatever...
You can find him lurking in the corner of the dance floor.
I'm probably gonna stop going to Escapade for a while...

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
They were handing out flyers at Paulownia Mall the last time I went.
It's the same one that's plastered all over the city.

Loud Female Student
Oh yeah, the one about Nyx, right?

Chatty Female Student
Huh, is that how you say it? I dunno, I just liked the logo.
The stuff written here is kinda interesting, too. Maybe I should ask them about it next time...

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
I'm so sleepy... It's been so cold that it's actually painful to leave the comfort of my bed.
I'm starting to think that living life with Apathy Syndrome would be easier...

Loud Female Student
I know, right? I could sleep all day, and people would get all concerned for me!

Chatty Female Student
Yeah, exactly! Maybe I really should get Apathy Syndrome—at least for a little while.

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
I've heard a lot of talk lately about salvation, and the world becoming renewed.
If everyone ends up getting Apathy Syndrome, we really might need something like that...

Loud Female Student
Yeah, I always hear people talk about it on TV.
I thought the cult sounded suspicious at first, but maybe it isn't...

Chatty Female Student
I mean, if the whole world believes in it, I'd feel stupid to be the only one denying it.

===============================================================================================

Loud Female Student
I've made zero progress studying for exams... I just can't concentrate at home.
Even if I wanted to go somewhere else to study, I don't have the money for it right now.

Chatty Female Student
Why don't you go to **the library** then?
It's nice and quiet, and you can find lots of reference materials there. Plus, it's free!

Loud Female Student
Hm, yeah, you've got a point. I could study there...
Argh, I just wish I had the money for the Prodigy Platter at Wakatsu!
Do you think it's really true? That just one bite could make you smarter? Oh, I envy the rich...

===============================================================================================

Loud Female Student
I spent my entire day off at the net café...
You can play computer games there, so I ended up trying a bunch of different ones.

Chatty Female Student
I knew that **they sell computer software** there, but I didn't realize you could use them in the private booths too.
It's always so packed there though, so I never feel like going.

Loud Female Student
Yeah, it was super crowded yesterday, too. It was a miracle I managed to get my own booth.
Next time I'll just buy the game. It's probably more relaxing to play it at home, anyways.

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I can hear people talking.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The first bell has rung.

Chatty Female Student
Is it just me, or have there been more weird people around lately?

Loud Female Student
Like the ones with Apathy Syndrome? There are some in my neighborhood, too... It's seriously creepy.
Sometimes I wonder what'll happen if I end up like that, and it just depresses me...

Chatty Female Student
Maybe we'll be okay if we exercise and improve our stamina.
Actually, I heard that **the track team is still accepting new members**. Maybe running will make us stronger?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Seems like the track team is
recruiting new members...
Maybe I can learn more about
it if I visit their club room.

===============================================================================================

Loud Female Student
Oh hey, you know the **bookstore** at the strip mall? Isn't their grand reopening today?

Chatty Female Student
Huh? A bookstore?

Loud Female Student
Yeah, leave Iwatodai Station, go straight for a while, and it's after you cross the crosswalk.
It's almost the new semester, so let's check out more shops in the city!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Apparently, the bookstore at the strip mall
is having a "grand reopening" today.
I wonder what kinds of
books they sell there...

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
Golden Week starts tomorrow. Do you have any plans?

Loud Female Student
Eh... Not really. But I'm not gonna miss tomorrow's show!

Chatty Female Student
Oh, yeah! You're talking about **Tanaka's Amazing Commodities**, right?
When I hear that jingle, I can't resist buying something...
I never miss it when it's on **Sunday afternoons**. I'm about to go broke!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
A shopping program that
airs on Sunday afternoons...
Since tomorrow's Sunday, maybe I'll
turn on the TV in my room to watch it.

===============================================================================================

Loud Female Student
Golden Week is over. I'm so sad...
You know, rabbits can die from sadness.

Chatty Female Student
Okay... One, you're not a rabbit. And two, it's not sadness, but loss of appetite.

Loud Female Student
What? No way! I thought for sure it was because of heartbreak!
Oh, speaking of sad... I saw **an elementary school kid at Naganaki Shrine** the last time I visited.
She looked so sad playing all by herself. I felt sorry for her...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
An elementary school student
alone at Naganaki Shrine...
I wonder if she's having
some sort of trouble...

===============================================================================================

Loud Female Student
Hey, I think our school might really be haunted!
A friend of my senpai's friend said that they heard a strange voice after school one day...

Chatty Female Student
No, don't tell me! I really can't handle ghost stories...
Ugh, I'm getting chills... Maybe I should head to the nurse's office.

Loud Female Student
No way! The nurse's office is THAT teacher's lair! Are you seriously going?
He'll give you some **weird medicine**, and you might actually end up feeling worse!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Apparently, the teacher in the nurse's
office hands out weird medicine.
I wonder what kind of ingredients it uses...

===============================================================================================

Loud Female Student
I heard from a younger guy in my club yesterday that a second-year is getting bullied.

Chatty Female Student
That's crazy... Which second-year?

Loud Female Student
I don't know... All I heard is that it's pretty serious.
I thought our school was peaceful, but I guess stuff like that still happens here...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It seems like someone in the same
grade as me is getting bullied...

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
Hey, did you hear that there's **an opening in the art club**?

Loud Female Student
Really? Did someone transfer schools?
But it sounds interesting. I'm tired of going straight home. Maybe it's time to join a club.

Chatty Female Student
Let's go check it out after school, then.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It seems like there's an
opening in the art club...
Maybe I can learn more about
them if I visit their club room.

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
Have you heard of this **revenge website**?
If you post someone's name on the website, they'll get revenge for you.
It's a 100% guaranteed success rate and completely anonymous.

Loud Female Student
Seriously!? Give me the URL! I wanna check it out now!

Chatty Female Student
Well, it's just a rumor, so I don't know the details...
Why are you so desperate anyways?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
A "revenge website"...
I wonder if it's a new ghost story...

===============================================================================================

Loud Female Student
Hey, did you hear about all those people who were found unconscious recently?
Apparently, a lot of them were couples!

Chatty Female Student
What, like they were attempting a double suicide or something?
I guess it's kinda romantic to sleep for eternity with your lover... like Romeo and Juliet.

Loud Female Student
Nuh-uh, no way! That's not romantic at all!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Couples were found unconscious together...
I wonder if it's because of the full moon...

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
It's almost summer break. Let's go somewhere for vacation!

Loud Female Student
Yeah! I wanna go to the sea, the mountains, everywhere and anywhere!
But first... we've got finals starting on Tuesday.

Chatty Female Student
Ugh, I'd forgotten about that.
At least we have a break after the exams this time! And summer vacation is just around the corner!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We have finals starting next week...

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
Good morning... Summer vacation is over...
What a bummer. Why does life suck...?

Loud Female Student
Haha, sounds like someone has Apathy Syndrome. Well, wouldn't life be easier if you actually did?

Chatty Female Student
Noooo! Do I really!?
On second thought, you're right. It doesn't sound too bad. At least I wouldn't have to worry about anything.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
People are getting used
to Apathy Syndrome...
Some people seem to think it's awful
while others think it's not so bad...

===============================================================================================

Chatty Male Student
Hey, did you hear!?
Yukari Takeba's gonna wear a maid dress for the culture festival!

Loud Male Student
Wait, seriously!? Is this a blessing from heaven!?

Chatty Male Student
The archery team is doing a maid café, and she drew the short straw.
I heard she's not stoked about it, so we gotta go support her, right?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Yukari seems to be the talk of the town.
It sounds like she's going to dress up
as a maid for the culture festival...

===============================================================================================

Chatty Male Student
Hey, did you go to the film festival during summer vacation?

Loud Male Student
Oh, the one at the Port Island movie theater? Yeah, I watched a bunch of things.
I heard they're gonna **have it again next week** for just one day. Wanna go?

Chatty Male Student
On the 23rd, right? I'll pass on this one.
I forgot what the theme this time was, but I remember it was all kiddy.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Looks like there's going to be a one-day
film festival next week on September 23rd.
Maybe I should invite
someone to come with me.

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
Is it just me, or are there a lot more cases where people lose consciousness recently?

Loud Female Student
It's all over the news again, too. The whole thing makes me uncomfortable...
What if it starts happening all over the world...?

Chatty Female Student
H-Hey, don't say stuff like that...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The number of unconscious
people seems to be rising again...

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
Midterms start next Tuesday. Math is killing me...
Sine! Cosine! Tangent!

Loud Female Student
Sine! Cosine! Tangent!
Sine Cosmos, Cosmos Sin Tan! Sin Cos Cos Sin, Cos Cos Sin Sin!

Chatty Female Student
What the heck...? What kind of spell are you chanting?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Midterms start next Tuesday...

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
Did you hear...?

Loud Female Student
The student council president's father died from an illness, right?
I can't even imagine what it's like to lose a parent...

Chatty Female Student
Yeah... I think I'll help my mom with some chores when I get home.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
......

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
Hey, good news!
I heard the boy who's transferring here today is one hot stud muffin!

Loud Female Student
Oh yeah! He came to school the other day to submit some paperwork, right?
I wonder which class he's in... If our seats are next to each other, we'd have to sit real close to share textbooks!

Chatty Female Student
Well... he's actually going to be in 2-F. We'll just have to go check him out later!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
A new student is transferring
to 2-F... That's my class.

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
The Kyoto trip is almost here.
I don't care much about shrines, but I'm still excited about it!

Loud Female Student
Me too! I want to see deers, and deers, and more deers!

Chatty Female Student
Just deers, eh...? Wait, isn't that in Nara, not Kyoto?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The school trip is next week...

===============================================================================================

Chatty Male Student
I was so excited about having next Monday off, but then I remembered **career experience week** starts Tuesday...
It's lame we have to work even though we won't get paid... What jobs did you get?

Loud Male Student
Tuesday and Wednesday, I've got a construction job. And on Thursday and Friday, I'm at a gas station...

Chatty Male Student
Dang, that sucks. And a teacher's gonna be keeping an eye on us the whole time, too.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Career experience week starts
Tuesday... Where will my job be?

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
Did you hear about Mochizuki-kun in Class 2-F?
His parents got transferred again, so he won't be around anymore.

Loud Female Student
Oh my god, really? So that's why he was absent yesterday...

Chatty Female Student
Who would've thought he'd manage to fit in so quickly in just one month. Talk about mysterious.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
......

===============================================================================================

Chatty Male Student
My brother has been acting weird lately.
When I pressed him for details, he told me **he was invited to join the cult** at Escapade.

Loud Male Student
Your brother's always been kinda gloomy, though.
Anyways, I never would've thought someone all for salvation and stuff would be at a club.

Chatty Male Student
Apparently, this guy's always lurking in the corner of the dance floor.
He's got this crazy look in his eye when he goes off about the "moment of salvation" or whatever.
Personally, I'd stay far away from him...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Someone suspicious seems to be persuading
people to join a cult at Club Escapade.
I should probably be more
careful whenever I go there...

===============================================================================================

Chatty Male Student
Our career consultation is next week, right? Are you planning to go to a university?

Loud Female Student
Yep! I'm going to study abroad!

Chatty Male Student
"Abroad"...!? This is the first I've heard about that!
I-I'm your boyfriend! You have to tell me stuff like this!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Our career consultation is next week...

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
So it turns out that cactus I bought at the 100-yen store was fake this whole time!
No wonder it didn't wither. And here I thought I was taking such great care of it.

Loud Female Student
Oh my god, that's hilarious! You put so much effort into watering it, too!
If you want a real plant, get one from a home center or, you know, an actual flower shop.

Chatty Female Student
Yeah, I think I'll buy one from **the flower shop on Port Island**.
I hear they've been selling seedlings for home gardening lately.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The florist at Port Island Station seems to
be selling seedlings for home gardens...
I might find new seedlings there.
I should check out what's in
stock every now and then.

===============================================================================================

Chatty Male Student
My parents have been nagging me to stop staying out late at night recently...
They said they don't want me to end up like those people who suddenly go crazy.

Loud Male Student
Oh, you mean Apathy Syndrome?
But I heard they still don't know what causes it, so what's the point of being careful?

Chatty Male Student
Yeah, I know, right? The prime time to hit up the arcade or work a shift is at night, too.
And if I can't go to **Hagakure at night** anymore, then I'll miss out on the taste of happiness!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Seems like some stores
are open at night, too.
I should go check them out
when I have the time...

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
What is your class doing for the culture festival?

Loud Female Student
A haunted house! I bet I'll be stuck playing the ghost.

Chatty Female Student
That doesn't sound too bad. You can just show up and put on the costume. I actually need to practice for a magic show...
But I also heard a typhoon is on its way, and that it's a big one... Are people really gonna turn up?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's almost time for the culture festival...

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
Hey, have you heard the rumor about, uh... What was it again? The bathroom?

Loud Female Student
That's old news. Besides, it's just a ghost story, not a rumor.
You're talking about that one girl, right? The second-year?
She stopped coming to school and just sits around staring at walls all day long.
Whenever her mom tries to talk to her, the only thing she says is, "It's coming... It's coming!"

Chatty Female Student
Is that really how the story goes? Eh, whatever. It's probably all made up anyway.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Some disturbing rumors seem to
be spreading around the school...

===============================================================================================

Loud Female Student
Hey, have you tried that famous beef bowl at Umiushi? It's only available for a limited time!

Chatty Female Student
I haven't! Is it new?

Loud Female Student
Yep! But only during fall! Everyone who's anyone has been raving about it.
Lots of shops have been putting out new products lately, like at MangaStar...
Wait, you really haven't heard about any of this? You've kinda been out of the loop, huh.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Sounds like various shops have new products
for sale. I should take a look sometime soon.

===============================================================================================

Chatty Female Student
I've been feeling kinda down lately, so I went to Escapade for a change of pace...
And someone was selling these brand-new, super cute accessories there!
Sucks I couldn't buy anything though. Everything was wayyy over my budget.
It's like I have nothing to talk about if I don't buy anything new... Is there anything affordable around here?

Loud Female Student
What about Umiushi's new menu item? People have been talking it up.

Chatty Female Student
Hm, maybe I'll try it! Gotta stay up to date with the latest trends and all.
Although... it seems like a lot of trends have to do with religion these days...?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Sounds like some shops have new
products out. I should take a look soon.

===============================================================================================

Loud Female Student
Hey, I think our school might really be haunted!
A friend of my senpai's friend said that they heard a strange voice after school one day...

Chatty Female Student
No, don't tell me! I really can't handle ghost stories...
Ugh, I'm getting chills... Maybe I should head to the nurse's office.

Loud Female Student
No way! The nurse's office is THAT teacher's lair! Are you seriously going?
He'll give you some **weird medicine**, and you might actually end up feeling worse!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
A teacher who gives out weird medicine...
Are they talking about Mr. Edogawa?
I should visit the nurse's office whenever
I'm feeling tired after going to Tartarus...

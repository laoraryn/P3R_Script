Mitsuru Kirijo
Welcome back, Arisato.
The exams are coming up. How's your studying going?
I still remember the second-year material well, so I can help you with anything you're unsure of.

Minato Arisato - Selection
That'll help.
You're too kind.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'm glad to hear it. We might as well take advantage of living in the same dorm, after all.
I know these will be your first exams here, but don't forget to help out the others where you can too.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Don't hesitate to ask for help. We might as well take advantage of living in the same dorm, after all.
I know these will be your first exams here, but don't forget to help out the others where you can too.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, it's you. I'm helping Akihiko with his studies at the moment.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Would you care to join us? I believe we can be of some help to you.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's study together.
What's everyone's status?
I want to go to Tartarus.
No thanks.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Very well. Then, let's begin.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I see. Sounds like you're confident about the exams.
Well, we'll likely be here all day, if you change your mind.

Mitsuru Kirijo
What's the matter? Did you want to study together after all?

Mitsuru Kirijo
What's the matter?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Did you want to study together after all?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's study together.
I want to go to Tartarus.
No thanks.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - All right, then let's begin.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I see. Well, I won't force you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
These people already have plans, so they can't go tonight:

SYS_014_0_0
Yukari Takeba

Mitsuru Kirijo
Is there anything else you need?

Mitsuru Kirijo
You want to go to Tartarus? I hope you aren't pushing yourself, especially with exams soon.
There are also those of us who can't go today. However, if you truly wish to go, I won't stop you.

Minato Arisato - Selection
I still want to go.
Never mind.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...All right. Let's gather everyone.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Good decision. It would be better to concentrate on your studies today.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Right now, the Temperance Arcana
may help me grow even more...

Akihiko Sanada
Hurt - Sorry, Mitsuru... I'm almost done...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Are those Mitsuru's notes?
You're sweating a lot.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Yeah, sh-she's letting me copy them. It covers the time I was at the hospital for my checkup.

Akihiko Sanada
Scheming - Hm? Well, you know how it is...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Akihiko, are you feeling unwell? You seem to be short of breath...

Akihiko Sanada
I'll be fine. More importantly, why don't you help Arisato's studies?
He ended up in the hospital right after transferring. Might need some help to make up for the class time he's missed.

Mitsuru Kirijo
You do have a point.
Here, these are my notes from last year. You can use them if you'd like.
I don't think the content of the class has changed much since then.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Your notes are as perfect as ever. They're easier to understand than the textbook itself.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Heh, flattery will get you nowhere.

Mitsuru Kirijo
But I suppose I am rather particular about my note-taking.
In class, I listen closely and write down bullet points. Then, I organize them later into a more readable format.
It's a bit time consuming, but I find it's overall a more efficient way of reviewing the material.
If you plan your day-to-day tasks effectively, test preparation is as good as done.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Appreciate the tips.
The truth hurts...
I'm getting sleepy...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Heh, you seem to have a knack for this. I'll teach you more of my study techniques next time.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - Hey now. If you don't prepare for the exams, it'll impact our fight against the Shadows. I need you to focus.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Would you like me to help wake you up? I'm sure a nice chill would help scare away the drowsiness.

Akihiko Sanada
Mitsuru's right. Efficiency is key.
We're all given the same amount of time... It's how well you manage it that can set you apart.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Indeed... Not even a second of time should be wasted. On that note, shall we return to studying?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Thanks to these two, I was able to
focus on my studies more than usual...

Akihiko Sanada
Exasperated* - Whew... All right! Done!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - Huh? Akihiko... You're drenched in sweat! And that heavy breathing... Are you sure you're—


Akihiko Sanada
Happy - I'm fine. I've just been squatting over my chair this whole time. Wanted to challenge myself to hold it until I was done with your notes.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Working out while studying is quite an efficient use of my time, wouldn't you say?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Exasperated* - Why are you like this...? I thought I told you not to push yourself until you've fully recovered!
Exasperated* - If you take efficiency too far, it'll backfire. Don't follow his example, okay Arisato?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Well then, I think we've made a fair amount of progress. Let's call it a night.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It seems some of us are having trouble focusing on studying for the exams.
So, I was thinking of holding a study group for all of us.

Mitsuru Kirijo
What do you think of that?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Good idea.
You shouldn't.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - So you agree. Then it's settled. I'll ask everyone to gather immediately.
When you're ready, wait for me at the table over there.
I'll see you in a bit.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I see... I suppose everyone does study at different paces.
Perhaps it would be best not to intrude...
Then again... Hmm... Well, I'll think about it for a while longer.

Mitsuru Kirijo
About the study session I was thinking of holding for everyone...
Sad - I'm still unsure as to what to do.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Have you given it any more thought?

Minato Arisato - Selection
We should do it.
We shouldn't do it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I see. Then it's settled. I'll ask everyone to gather immediately.
When you're ready, wait for me at the table over there.
I'll see you in a bit.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I see. Is it really not a good idea...?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Right now, the Temperance Arcana
may help me grow even more...

-----

Mitsuru Kirijo
Right, then. I decided to hold this study session for us to concentrate on the upcoming exams.
Amada, I invited you to join us so you can focus on your own studies. Your presence is welcome here.

Ken Amada
Thank you for inviting me. I'll make sure not to be a bother to everyone.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - To the rest of you, I want you to set a proper example and take your studies seriously.

Koromaru
Woof!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Hehe... Are you going to study with us, Koro-chan? Good boy.

Koromaru
Happy - Arf! Arf!

Aigis
Koromaru-san says that he will accompany us here as we study.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Well, aren't you a little hard worker? Unlike Junpei over there, who can't stop yawning.

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - Uhh, can't really deny it... Wouldn't mind bein' in his place right about now.
Happy - Dogs never have to study for exams like this. Man, what a life... Woof!

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'd love to be one.
Being a dog isn't easy.
Shake, Junpei!

Junpei Iori
Right? If we were dogs, we could just play all day!

Koromaru
Angry - Bark! Bark!

Aigis
He says it's not all fun and games.
Koromaru-san tirelessly patrols the neighborhood each day.

Yukari Takeba
You hear that? You think you could keep that up, every single day?

Junpei Iori
Sad - Dammit... The dog wins again...

Koromaru
Arf! Arf!

Aigis
He is glad that you understand.
Koromaru-san never misses a day patrolling the neighborhood, after all.

Yukari Takeba
You hear that? Think you could keep that up, every single day?

Junpei Iori
Sad - Dammit... The dog wins again...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Woof!

Yukari Takeba
Stay!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Woof!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Um... Go home...?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Time for me to go back to my room! Arf!
Surprised - ...Wait, don't try to get rid of me! Arrooo...

Aigis
Koromaru-san may not have an obligation to study, but he has another important mission.

Fuuka Yamagishi
True... He's been protecting that shrine this whole time. That sounds like something far more difficult.

Akihiko Sanada
Guess if you want to be a dog, you'd better develop some diligence like Koromaru here.

Ken Amada
Sad - Being a dog is harder than it seems... You'd be better off just studying, Junpei-san.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Oh, stop! Don't look at me like some pitiful creature!

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right, that's enough chitchat. Let's concentrate on our studies.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Knowing everyone's watching
keeps me accountable...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - All right, I think we can begin wrapping things up. Good work, everyone.
And Iori... After all the dog talk, I do hope you were able to get through the material you needed to cover.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Uh... Woof?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh, I see. So you're still learning, then? As a dog, I'll need to give you strict behavioral training.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - I-I'm kidding! It was a joke! I'm totally cool being human... No training needed, I'm good!

Aigis
Happy - That will conclude the group study session. It is time for a much-deserved rest.

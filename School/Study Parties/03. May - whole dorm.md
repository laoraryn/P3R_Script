Midterms begin tomorrow. Are you adequately prepared?
It would be problematic if you neglected your studies because of our extracurricular activities.
Happy - It won't fully make up for it, but we've decided to hold a group study session with everyone today.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It isn't mandatory, of course, but would you like to join us?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'll join the study group.
I want to go to Tartarus.
Let me think about it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right, then. Take a seat and let's get started.

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right. If you decide to join, we'll be right here.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Yes? Did you decide to join the study session?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Yes?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Did you decide to join the study session?

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'll join.
I want to go to Tartarus.
I'm still thinking about it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right, then. Take a seat and let's get started.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Well, we'll be here if you decide to join.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - I don't think you appreciate the importance of these exams!
Of course, Tartarus is important too... But I'd like you to focus on what's right in front of you first.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Right now, the Temperance Arcana
may help me grow even more...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Yes, correct. The answer is "May blues." Next, for the following sentence...

Junpei Iori
......

Mitsuru Kirijo
What's the matter, Iori? Feeling the May blues?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Wha!? Oh, uh, it's nothing!

Yukari Takeba
Um, Kirijo-senpai! About this question here...

Junpei Iori
Scheming - Hey, Minato... You smell that? It's insane...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Smell what?
Focus.
I'm getting hungry...

Junpei Iori
Scheming - You know what I'm talking about! There's this floral scent coming from Kirijo-senpai's direction...

Junpei Iori
Surprised - How do you expect me to do that!? C'mon, that fragrance across the table is just...

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Come on, man, get your priorities straight! Don't you notice when a sensual fragrance comes your way!?

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Yeah, I know what you mean. To be honest, I can't get enough of it.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Aha! Now that's what I'm talkin' about, Sanada-san!
Happy - Man, this is heaven... Such grace, such elegance! Truly the fragrance of the upper class!

Akihiko Sanada
I'd personally describe it as... stimulating. I can almost taste the juicy tenderness.

Junpei Iori
Uh, what?

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Oh, I was heating up a beef bowl for a late-night snack. Smells pretty good, right?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - ...A beef bowl? That's what you were talking about!?

Minato Arisato - Selection
My mouth is watering.
I've been waiting for this!

Junpei Iori
Angry - Not you too! C'mon, guys like us should be thinking with our... Well, not our stomachs!

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - Ahaha... Sanada-san, you don't happen to have any extra, do you?

Mitsuru Kirijo
No eating until you've gotten some work done. Stay focused, Arisato—keep your hand moving.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The enticing smell of the beef bowl
motivated me more than usual...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Beef, beef, beeeeeef!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Exasperated* - For goodness sake... All right, if you answer five more questions correctly, you can have your food.

Junpei Iori
Very angry* - Hraaaaaah! Beef. Beef! BEEEEEEF!

Akihiko Sanada
Exasperated* - You're like a horse with a carrot dangled in its face...

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - One mention of food, and you finally give a crap. That's all it takes, huh?

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right, that should be enough for tonight. Make sure not to eat too much before bed.

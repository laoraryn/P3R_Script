Excited Student
Sanada-kun, wait!

Noisy Student
Sanada-kuuun!

Man's Voice
Hey, hold on a sec. You're the captain, aren't you?

Boxing Team Member
Hey, quit pushing! Practice is over!

Athletic Scout
You there! Sanada-kun, right?

Akihiko Sanada
...That's right.

Athletic Scout
That was an incredible bout! I've never seen a middle schooler deliver a KO like that!
I'm with the school you were up against in the finals. What do you say to enrolling with us?
We'll give you a real generous scholarship—

you'd only have to pay half your tuition!

Boxing Team Member
Wait, you're from another school!? Poaching's against the rules and you know it!

Akihiko Sanada
Sorry, but I don't see any reason to attend a school that places second.
...Good luck finding someone else.

Noisy Student
Sanada-kun, you're so cool!

Excited Student
You hear that? He'd never go to your loser school!

Boxing Team Member
Seriously, will you all just go home already!?
We can't leave until you guys do, dammit!

Akihiko Sanada
......

Female Student's Voice
Couldn't you have handled that with a little more tact?

Poised Student
Happy - I heard it gets crowded after practice, so I decided to wait here instead.
Happy - Third-year, Class C... Akihiko Sanada-kun.

Akihiko Sanada
What do you want?

Poised Student
Hm...? You're not going to ask who I am?

Akihiko Sanada
Why bother?
Whatever it is you're here for, I'm not interested. All I want is to train and become stronger.

Poised Student
Happy - Oh, it's nothing troublesome. In fact, I have a rather simple request.

Akihiko Sanada
What request...?

Poised Student
I have enemies that need defeating.

Poised Student
Only thing is, they're not people—meaning, there's no need to play by the rules, not like in the ring.
No, these enemies... They're related to what you go through every midnight.

Akihiko Sanada
Surprised - ...!?

Poised Student
You see, I'm in the same situation. I experience the same thing you do.
The difference is, I know what it means, so if you'll join me... I'll share what I know with you.

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - ...Who are you?

Poised Student
Mitsuru Kirijo. I'm a third-year, like yourself.

Akihiko Sanada
"Kirijo"? Sounds familiar.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Earlier, you said you wanted to train and become stronger, but what you really need is a challenge.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - And with this... you'll be able to defeat them.

Akihiko Sanada
Surprised - ......

===============================================================================================

Metis
Surprised - The door vanished this time, too...

Akihiko Sanada
First Amada's past, and now mine... What in the world does this mean?

Ken Amada
Sad - I have no idea, either...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - That certainly takes me back, though... We were both in middle school then.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Truth be told, I thought you lost it until the moment I first summoned my Persona.
Happy - I mean, what else was I supposed to think when this random rich girl gave me a gun five minutes after we met?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Well, it grabbed your attention, didn't it? So I'd say my plan went off without a hitch.
Happy - Had I asked you to "fight for justice," you wouldn't have bothered listening.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - You know me so well.

Metis
So that was a "school"...

Aigis
Yes, it was. But it was only a small portion of one.

Metis
Surprised - Really? Then, it's actually much bigger than that?

Aigis
That's right.
...Have you really never been outside before?

Metis
Sad - Well... I, um...

Aigis
Happy - I didn't mean to embarrass you. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Happy - Come to think of it, I wasn't permitted to leave the dorm at first, either.

Metis
Happy - Do you... Do you also go to school?

Aigis
I did... But I won't be attending as of this spring.

Metis
Surprised - Huh? You won't? But why?
Surprised - Everyone else is going. I thought you liked being with your friends.

Aigis
Sad - Why...? It's because I, um...

Aigis
It doesn't matter. I thought it over and came to a decision after some time.

Metis
Sad - Oh... I see.

Fuuka Yamagishi
You know... I don't think Metis is a bad person at all.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Yeah, she's not "bad," more like...

Junpei Iori
Maybe we've been taking her a little too seriously up 'til now because, honestly...

Junpei Iori
Happy - She's really just a kid inside, isn't she?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Maybe so.

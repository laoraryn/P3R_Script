Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Greedy Shadow defeated! Nice job!   
Happy - We managed to recover the treasure it was hoarding, too!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I'm beat... But I feel accomplished since it worked out in the end.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - There's no way it could've escaped from me, Junpei the Lord of Speed.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - That was some pretty good footwork, but we were a cut above.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - That was quite an endeavor, but at least it was worth it in the end.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Unused   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Mission successful. That was a good workout experience.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - We did it! You know... Chasing it was kinda fun...   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Arf arf!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Sheesh, damn bastard made us chase it like some field day event... Well, at least it went well.   
   
Metis   
Happy - You did it! Great job, Sis!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - I'm glad you're all safe. It's too bad it got away...   
Exasperated* - It seems it took off with all the treasure on this floor too...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Ugh, after we ran around so much, too! That's totally cheating.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - I can't believe I screwed this up! We'll kick its ass for sure next time!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - That was a big catch we lost... We'll have our revenge next time.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It seems our opponent was one step ahead of us this time... Well, we'll just have to be more prepared.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Unused   
   
Aigis   
It found a complete upper hand on us. I suppose this would be a case of the enemy being "damn impressive."   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Oh well, we did our best. Chasing it was kinda fun, though.   
   
Koromaru   
Sad - *whine*   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Talk about a damn fast runner... Heh, guess I'm a sore loser.   
   
Metis   
Sad - I'm sorry I let you down... How could something so big move so fast anyway!?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh... But it seems that Shadow dropped something while running away.   
Happy - Let's check it out.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I now have a full grasp of this floor's layout, thanks to us chasing it down.   
I'll guide you to the stairs.

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - There it is! Please chase it!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - You're slowly catching up to the Shadow! Hang in there!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - The Shadow is slowing down. Just a little more to go. Don't give up!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - It's so fast that I lost its reading... Which way could it have gone...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I'm sorry, I lost sight of it again... Which way did it go...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - Considering how far we've come, we have to catch up to it! This is the last one!

Yukari Takeba   
Angry - I saw it when it made the turn!   
Angry - It's definitely this way! Let's go!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Scheming - Hehe, I totally saw where that shiny, giant thing went.   
Happy - It's this way! Everyone follow me!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Scheming - I could see a glimpse of its shadow from my point of view.   
Scheming - It ran off this way. Let's go!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It was faint, but I saw light gleam off of its body.   
I'm not completely certain, but it should be this way. Let's hurry!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Koro-chan, you were able to tell which way it went?   
Angry - Aigis, follow Koro-chan!   
   
Aigis   
I should be able to identify the direction it went based on the location that can be deduced from its footsteps.   
I am quite certain it went this way. Let us go.   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - I saw a glimpse of it running away from us!   
Angry - I'm pretty sure it went that way! Let's go!   
   
Koromaru   
Angry - Woof! Woof woof!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
I saw where it went from my position.   
It's this way. We going after it?   
   
Metis   
Angry - I saw it go that way!   
Angry - Come on! Let's corner it!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Unused   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hurt - It's a dead end! It seems we went the wrong way...   
Sad - Oh no, the reading is getting farther and farther away... I guess this might be it...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - It's a dead end... It seems we went the opposite direction as that Shadow...   
Sad - The Shadow's reading is getting further away. It escaped...   
At the very least, we can get this treasure chest it missed.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The Shadow's movement has stopped. It seems it's hit a dead end!   
Angry - Let's hurry! Just keep going straight!   
   
---   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - We've caught the Shadow! Now it's time to defeat it!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - Now! It's in your hands, everyone!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - This is our chance! Don't let it escape!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Ugh, it's so fast! We're taking it down right here and now!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Got 'em! You ain't goin' anywhere, pal!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
This is turning into a hassle... We're dealing with it now!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - So it's been consumed by its obsession with treasure... No matter, we'll deal with it here!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi

Aigis   
We finally cornered it. There is no escape!   
   
Ken Amada   
Huh, it's actually pretty big now that we've closed in on it. Let's take it down!   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Why you gotta run...? Let's just hurry up and beat the crap out of it.   
   
Metis   
Angry - We've got it now! Let's take it out!   
   
------   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The Shadow has been eliminated.   
I don't sense any other enemies nearby. Let's keep moving.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The Shadow has been defeated.   
I'm not sensing any other enemies. Let's move on.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Wait, the Shadow is making a move...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Exasperated* - ...I don't sense it anymore. It seems it ran away.   
There don't appear to be other enemies around either. Well, let's keep moving.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh! I'm sensing movement from the Shadow!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - ...I don't detect it anymore. I guess it ran away...   
There don't seem to be any other enemies around here, so let's move on.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - What!? It's ransacking the treasure chest!   
A Shadow that goes after treasure chests... I wonder why...   
Also, it may be a coincidence, but there are more chests than usual on this floor.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - It's... stealing from the treasure chest!?   
Why would a Shadow do that? I wonder if it's searching for something...   
Oh, and there are more chests than usual on this floor. Is that just a coincidence?   
   
top - SEL_HIGHRARE_STEAL_00   
More chests, huh?   
Just a "coincidence"?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hm... It would seem that the Shadow came specifically for the treasure chests.   
If that's the case, we could take advantage of its obsession with treasure.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Well, by the looks of it... the Shadow came here for those treasure chests.   
If it loves treasure so much, maybe we could use that to our advantage!   
   
SYS_HIGHRARE_STEAL_00   
Greedy Shadows appear on floors with many treasure chests. They will scurry around and open the treasure chests one after another.   
They are quick and nearly impossible to catch on foot. Take advantage of their obsession and intercept them on their way to treasure chests.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
First, look for a treasure chest that the Shadow has yet to get its hands on.   
If we take its beloved treasure first, it will likely try to come after us.   
Once it gets close, we'll be able to strike!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
First, find a treasure chest that the Shadow hasn't gotten to yet.   
It might come looking for us if we take the treasure it was after.   
If it does, then we'll have a chance to fight it!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Are you giving up on catching that Shadow?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right, then. Carry on.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, are you done trying to catch that Shadow?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Okay, keep trying, then. You can do it!   
   
top - SEL_HIGHRARE_BLOCK   
I won't give up!   
I guess I should keep trying.

Metis   
Surprised - Oh, right! I better explain how my Orgia Mode works to you.   
   
Metis   
Happy - As you may know, Sister, I can also activate Orgia Mode.   
Happy - This ability allows me to temporarily disable my limiters.   
As a result, my offensive capabilities will increase significantly.   
However, in exchange, I won't be able to receive direct commands.   
And after using Orgia Mode, I'll eventually overheat and briefly become immobile.   
It'll take some time before my systems cool down and become operational again.   
So it's best to use it at the most opportune moment.   
Happy - ...That's about it. Should I go over it again?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Yes, can you?   
No, I'm good.   
   
Metis   
Happy - You can give me the command to activate Orgia Mode once my Theurgy's ready!

Metis's Neo Orgia Mode is different from Aigis's Orgia Mode.   
Metis's version lasts longer than Aigis's. During this duration, there will be no SP or HP consumption to use skills.   
Once her Orgia Mode ends, Metis will overheat and be rendered immobile among other significant drawbacks.   
Use it when the time is right for maximum effectiveness.

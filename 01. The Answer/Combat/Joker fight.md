Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - What...? That shadowy figure again...!?   
Sad - Wait, no... This is something else. I've never sensed anything like it before!   
Sad - I doubt it's just a regular Shadow, so if you decide to track it down, please be careful.

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - It seems like... whatever it is slipped away.   
Sad - It feels so strange... What in the world could it be...?

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Who could that be? I don't think it's anyone we've come across before.   
Surprised - His reading is so strange... It's powerful, but at the same time... It kind of feels like he's not really there at all.   
Sad - And why is he appearing in front of us so confidently all of a sudden?   
Sad - Aigis, if you're thinking about approaching him, please prepare as best as you can first.   
Sad - I can't tell what his intentions are, but I have a bad feeling...

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - So that's where that reading was coming from!?   
Sad - I can't make sense of this data. It's powerful, but somehow faint... It's like he's not actually here.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - He's going to attack! Aigis, get ready!

I'm not picking up the signal anymore. It looks like we've won.   
Sad - He was so strong... He even had the same power as Aigis.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
That was a formidable foe.   
That was an easy fight.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - You can say that again. Good work out there.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Hehe. I never doubted you for a second.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - Still, though... I wonder who that was. He gave off such a strange reading.   
Exasperated* - Like it wasn't a Shadow, but it wasn't human either. It was more like... a mass of someone's thoughts or desires?   
Exasperated* - The more I think about it, the less sense it makes...   
   
Metis   
Surprised - If I had to guess... I'd say that person was likely the product of the Abyss of Time reflecting someone's wishes.

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Really? But none of us know who that person is, so I don't think any of us would have wished to encounter them.   
   
Metis   
Maybe nobody wished to meet that specific person, but they could've wished for something like...   
"I want to fight someone really strong," for example. Something more vague.

Aigis - Selection   
Yes, I was wishing that.   
I wouldn't wish for that.   
Perhaps it was Sanada-san.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh, in that case, I guess your wish was granted! Maybe it's because you've been going into the Abyss so often.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - Hmm... Maybe it wasn't exactly that, but something similar, like you wished to get stronger, or you wished for a challenge...?   
I think it could make sense for wishes like that to be granted like this too.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah, that sounds like me, all right.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - That does certainly sound like something he would wish for...   
   
Metis   
I guess it's also possible that the Abyss had nothing to do with it, and this was the doing of some other thing in some other place...

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - A place other than the Abyss...?   
   
Metis   
Maybe someone's—or multiple people's—inner thoughts were manifested somewhere else, and that place connected to the Abyss...   
Surprised - And if the Abyss used that connection to grant a wish, then maybe both it and the other place are equally responsible...

Sad - Um... This got too complicated. I'm lost.

Exasperated* - Me too. Maybe we're just not meant to understand what happened...

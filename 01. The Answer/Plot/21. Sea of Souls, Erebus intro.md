Aigis   
Angry - Let's go.   
   
---   
   
Aigis   
We're here...   
   
Aigis   
Angry - What...!?   
   
Metis   
Surprised - That wasn't here before...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It seems we truly do have one final battle ahead of us.   
Let's make sure we're as prepared as possible before proceeding.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Scheming - Heh, works for me.   
Scheming - We'll get to the bottom of this no matter what stands in our way.   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
A new path in the Desert of Doors   
will lead us to the final battle...   
The answers we seek lie just beyond it.   
We should take all possible measures to   
prepare before going through the door.   
   
---   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - What is this place...?   
   
Aigis   
Very angry* - I can feel it... This is the site of the final battle...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Hey... I can move...!   
   
Metis   
If it's a past that everyone experienced, then you can interact with it, remember?   
It's just like that shopping mall.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Uh, "everyone"? But this ain't your past, right?   
   
Metis   
Happy - It's probably because I...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - Nyx...!   
Surprised - And... That figure...!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - ...!   
   
---   
   
Aigis   
So this is... the miracle he performed...   
   
---   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - What is this...?   
   
Metis   
That's... his life essence.   
   
Metis   
This is what happened that night...   
Using the power of the Great Seal, his own essence became the seal.   
But when someone's life essence leaves their body, they die...   
To do this intentionally... He must have already found his answer to life.   
   
Aigis   
"His answer to life"...   
   
Metis   
Happy - I don't think he has any regrets.   
Happy - He even managed to keep his promise to you all before his consciousness finished fading away...   
   
Ken Amada   
"His promise"? You mean to meet up on graduation day?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Wait... How do you know about all that?   
   
Metis   
"How"...? I just do.   
I'm probably like Nyx, or this person who became the seal... I think I belong on this side.   
   
Metis   
Hm... Nyx is able to bring death to all things, but...   
If she's that powerful... then what was stopping her before he became the seal?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Huh... Was there someone else...?   
   
Metis   
Then what about before humanity existed?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What are you getting at?   
   
Metis   
I'm not sure why this occurred to me, but I don't think Nyx is malicious...   
Normally, a seal shouldn't be necessary.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very angry* - What!? Are you saying he did this for nothing!?   
   
Metis   
No, I think what he was actually trying to do—   
   
   
Junpei Iori   
Horrified - Uhh, the hell was that!?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - Everyone, look!   
   
---   
   
Aigis   
Wha...!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Ah...!   
   
Aigis   
No!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
This is... not a Shadow...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...!?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I think it's...   
It's all of humanity's...   
   
Metis   
Just as I thought... The purpose of his seal—   
   
It's not meant to hold back Nyx.   
   
Metis   
It's to prevent something from reaching her.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What do you mean?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
That giant monster...   
It's not a Shadow...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It's... a mass of the worst traits and   
feelings from every person's heart...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Deep down...   
Everyone is calling for Nyx...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That can't be...   
   
Aigis   
There was a time...   
when I also wished for death.   
   
Aigis   
It's probably true that everyone has   
a part of them secretly yearning for it...   
   
Aigis   
The only thing that separates   
the living from the nonliving...   
   
Aigis   
Is death... The greatest equalizer.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I think I understand...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
When you feel like your life has no meaning,   
the thought of death can be comforting...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
And that subconscious desire is so strong...   
it could even create a monster like this.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I guess that's... just how it is these days.   
   
Junpei Iori   
What the hell...!?   
   
---   
   
Junpei Iori   
Horrified - Why's it after us!?   
   
Metis   
Surprised - It must want my sister! She has the same power as the one who created the seal!   
   
Metis   
Surprised - Are you... going to fight it!? You can't take on something like that!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Very angry* - This is a battle we can't run from.   
Very angry* - The feelings that created this monster came from within me as well.   
Very angry* - I couldn't accept reality, so I wished for the past... despite that past harboring death and bloodshed.   
Very angry* - There isn't a doubt in my mind... This is the cause of all our struggles.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Sounds good to me. Let's take it down!   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - This isn't just a fight against a monster... I'll be facing myself as well. And I'm ready!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very angry* - I won't run away this time... He's watching us, and we can't let him down!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Scheming - This thing's got no chance of beatin' us! And I'm likin' those odds!   
   
Metis   
Sister...   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Don't worry. It won't stop us.   
Happy - To live means to not give in to your own weaknesses...   
   
Aigis   
Angry - So we won't lose! We will live!   
   
---   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - What is that...? I don't like the looks of it...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - Maybe it's preparing something...? Be careful!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - I'm picking up a massive energy surge within the enemy!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - That power... It's terrible...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - If that attack were to land multiple times... Um, I'm gonna try scanning!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - You can't afford to keep taking that attack! You have to stop it somehow!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - These readings... Oh! While it's charging up, its power levels become unstable!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - If you can disrupt it, that should prevent its attack! Everyone, go on the offensive!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - Focus on attacking, just like before! That should disrupt the enemy's charging!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - It's gathering even more power than before...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Brace for— No, it's too strong... You have to stop it from attacking at all!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - It's even stronger...!?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - You don't stand a chance against this one! You need to interrupt that attack!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - It's gone...! And it looks like the enemy can't move!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - Now's your chance!

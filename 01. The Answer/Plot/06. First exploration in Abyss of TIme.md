Junpei Iori   
Happy - Every time I get geared up, my brain gets into this mindset, like... "Time to get 'er done!" Y'know?   
   
Metis   
No, actually, I don't know...   
   
Metis   
Happy - I'm just happy I get to match with my sister.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - She got all pouty the moment we changed clothes...   
Sad - Who would've thought she just wanted an armband?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - ...This doesn't make you one of us, though.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Still, it's a good thing you've got one on.   
This way, I can get a detailed read on your vitals.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I had some extras prepared, but I didn't expect we would need them again.   
Well, is everyone ready to start exploring? Are we missing anything?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Exasperated* - I don't think so, but... I've got a bad feeling about this.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Junpei here might not, but what about the rest of you?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Yeah, I can't put my finger on it, but something does feel off...   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Agreed. Something's not sitting quite right.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Huh? I'm the only one hyped...?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Wait, hold up, I definitely feel something... I think? Maybe?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yamagishi, have there been any changes to our readings?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Um... Well, I don't know how to put this, but...   
Sad - They're indicating that everyone's strength has weakened significantly, which may prove to be an impediment...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Uh, ain't that, like, really bad for us!? Is it 'cause of that Abyss of Time thing?   
   
Metis   
I don't seem to be affected. Are you sure it's not simply because you're all weak?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Oh, we're weak, are we?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Save it for later, Akihiko.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
So if it's not because of the Abyss... Does it have something to do with us?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - We did take a step back from fighting for a while, so that's probably the biggest factor.   
Sad - More importantly, your Personas' output is currently unstable, so their abilities are partially limited right now.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Maybe we just forgot how to fight? Does muscle memory even go away...?   
Not that it really matters. All we can do right now is work with what we've got.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Easy for you to say, but... Aigis, you're nervous too, aren'tcha?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I'm uneasy.   
She's right. It doesn't matter.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Right? I don't know, this seems like it'll be pretty rough...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Man... Even Ai-chan's on Yuka-tan's side.   
   
Metis   
Happy - You have nothing to worry about, Sister. I'll be there for you.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Well, now that we've established the situation at hand...   
I'd like to set expectations a bit before we head out.   
I should operate on my own to find out whether or not there's more to those materials we found underground.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Flying solo, huh?   
I guess you are the only one who can identify that sort of thing, though.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'll regroup with everyone once I learn more.   
There's something else I want to look into as well, so it's more efficient for the team to progress without me there.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Your objective is to see if the Abyss of Time connects to anywhere else besides the dorm.   
And since we don't know how much time this will take, it's imperative that we secure our supply routes.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, in that case, kinda seems like a job for Koromaru, don't it?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - I mean, he's sharper than a human! Y'know, with his sense of smell and all.   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Arf!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Yeah? You're game, bud? I'm a little worried about us being weaker than usual, though... So how 'bout I come with ya?   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Arf, arf! Awooo!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right, I'll let the two of you handle that, then.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
**Iori, Koromaru, and I will go about our own tasks.   
**Everyone else, follow Aigis's command and focus on exploring.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm counting on you, Aigis.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Leave it to me.   
I hope to reunite with you all soon.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - That's what I like to hear—and you can count on me to bring back results, too.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
And I as well. Give it the best you've got, Aigis.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Let's head out once you've decided on our course of action.   
If we want to make progress, then we better get to it.   
   
---   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Huh...? What was that just now?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - That thing went through this door, didn't it?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - What's going on?   
   
Metis   
Sad - I'm not sure either. It all happened so quickly...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Why not start our exploration here, then?   
Not like we have much else to go on. Couldn't hurt to pursue anything suspicious.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right, then I'll leave this to you. Be careful in there.   
   
---   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - The Desert of Doors...   
Interesting...   
Well, now we know where that door leads.   
   
---   
   
Aigis   
A door...   
   
Metis   
Looks like we've reached the first goal.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
This place was bigger than I thought. How many more times we gotta do this?   
   
Metis   
I don't know for sure.   
But judging by the Desert of Doors, I'm betting it's not going to be just once or twice.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Ugh... I was afraid you'd say that.   
   
Metis   
We're looking for the source of our troubles, so logically, it should be at the deepest level.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Then all we can do is keep going until we reach the end...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's like Tartarus all over again.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The two of them do share some similarities.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Like the friggin' Shadows wandering around...   
Exasperated* - Man... And here I thought we were done with 'em for good.   
   
Junpei Iori   
The Lost are all gone now, though... So why are we still dealin' with the Shadows?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Only way to know is to start looking for an answer... Not like we're getting out of this until we find one, anyway.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - ......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hm...? What's wrong?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - Oh, nothing. It's just...   
Looking away - After the hell we went through, we finally had some peace...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Determined - I told myself I'd focus on the future, and not look back.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - But now it feels like nothing's changed! I thought we were through with fighting!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Yukari...   
   
Metis   
Time doesn't flow normally here...   
So it's no surprise you feel that way.   
You'll find that there will be many opportunities to revisit your past here.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - What's that supposed to mean...?

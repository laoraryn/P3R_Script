Slacking off on training can impact both boxing and actual battles.   
It's too bad I've fallen out of practice. I'll have to work harder to get back to where I was before.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
First, the dorm's connected to some kind of labyrinth, and now we're traveling to the past...?   
Angry - What exactly is going on here, dammit!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I thought I'd been doing all right, making sure my stamina doesn't get any worse, but guess I thought wrong.   
Actual combat can't compare to working out at the gym, but... That's just an excuse.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - Losing a parent is hard... in more than one way.   
Sad - It was hard for me, too—and I was too young to even remember my parents' faces.   
Sad - I don't think any of us can blame Amada for the decisions he made back then.   
Sorry, didn't mean to make the mood so glum. Was just thinking about things.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Shinji joined the team right after I did.   
His potential wasn't that high, though. Nobody was sure if he could even control his Persona.   
I told him to give up, but... He just pushed his way into the dorm, wouldn't take no for an answer.   
Sad - I guess he did all that for me... Seriously, that guy...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Koromaru wasn't the only one he met that day. I ran into him as well.   
If I hadn't been out patrolling that night, maybe he wouldn't be here, fighting with us.   
Happy - A chance encounter indeed.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - Makes you wonder what it's like to be born into a prestigious family. To think she was fighting Shadows at that young an age...   
Sad - Shinji and I don't even remember our parents' faces. It was painful, but... in a way, that made things easier for us as well.   
Especially considering the burden Mitsuru must have had to shoulder.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Metis said that we're the reason the Abyss of Time exists, right...?   
Angry - And the place is infested with Shadows... Dammit, what the hell does it all mean!?   
Angry - At the risk of sounding like Junpei... I have no idea what's going on.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Scheming - Looked like that figure was trying to lure us in... Heh. We could just take the bait.   
Scheming - We'll find out who exactly this mystery person is soon enough.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I understand why someone would want to change the past, how desperate they must be for the chance to do so...   
But would we be meddling with the past for him? Or for our own sake?   
Sad - Because he wasn't the victim of some random accident. He chose this.   
That's why... I won't change the past. I'll never agree to it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Why he lost his life, huh...   
I thought I had already accepted his death, but... Maybe, in the end, I didn't want to face it.   
I'll see it through this time, though. For closure's sake.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - Before we fought, I said you had nothing to fight for, didn't I? Sorry about that.   
Sad - You put your life on the line to arrive at your answer... Guess there's still a lot I have to learn.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hey, good timing. You free right now?   
Was hoping we could talk about that book we found in the Abyss. You know, ?   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
Should I spend time with Sanada-san...?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I think I will.   
Not right now, no.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Thanks. Amada's been reading it, and he's got some questions.   
Happy - Figured it'd be a good idea for him to get some pointers from people with different fighting styles.   
Happy - Let's head over.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All right. Well, just let me know when you've got the time.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Oh, hey. Listen, I've got some time on my hands right now...   
So I was thinking about reading that book we found in the Abyss. You interested?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All right, let's go, then.   
Happy - "," huh... Interesting title. Kinda got me curious.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All good. Not like reading it together changes the content or anything.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
What's up? That book pique your interest?

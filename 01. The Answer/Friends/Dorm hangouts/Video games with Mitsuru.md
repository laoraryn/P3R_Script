Junpei's Voice   
Dude, what are you even DOING? That's not gonna work!   
   
Amada's Voice   
Junpei-san, could you please be quiet!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Sounds like tensions are running high.   
Since we're essentially confined within an enclosed space, we should avoid such situations. Let's step in and mediate.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What's with all the commotion? Is there a problem?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Oh, uh... Nothing, really. No big deal. Ahaha... Hahaha.   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - Junpei-san was getting worked up because he can't beat this game.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - What game...?   
Ah, you're referring to that object we found during our exploration? The , was it?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Yep, that's the one! I was havin' a rough time tryin' to clear it.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Then Amada here was all like, "Let me handle this!" So I let 'im take over, but he wasn't even any better!   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - Because SOMEONE was being loud and distracting!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Exasperated* - *sigh* So you two were arguing... over a game?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - No, seriously! You don't get it, this game is stupid hard!   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - It really is. How could anyone possibly beat it with Junpei-san screaming in their ear...?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Stop fighting.   
Everyone, calm down.   
No more games.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Ngh... Sorry.   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - Awww... Really?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
There's no need to go that far, Aigis.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If this game is the source of your frustration, then this matter shall be put to rest once it's beaten, correct?   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - I... I guess so?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Then let's begin.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Amada, I want you to move per my directions. First, fall back.   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - Oh, uh, right!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
One, two, three... Now head to the right, don't stop. There's an opening ahead. You can't miss it.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Whoa...!   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - ...We won. We actually won. I can't believe it.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Well done.   
How did you do that?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - I didn't do anything particularly noteworthy.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Oh, it was nothing. I'm sure you could have done it just as well.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Remember: observe the enemy's positioning, then identify a weakness in their formation you can exploit.   
Once you've broken their defenses, they'll crumble, making it quite easy to wipe them out.   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - Ha... Haha... Quite easy, yes...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Takin' out the weakest link first, huh... Seems kinda dirty, though.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I understand the feeling.   
It's a legitimate tactic.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Yeah? I mean, I know it's just a game, but at some point, I just felt sorry for 'em...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Yeah, I get that, but... I dunno, it just feels bad steamrolling 'em like that.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Exasperated* - I can't say I agree. Would you still feel the same way when facing a real enemy?   
...Perhaps this is a good opportunity to remind you all of the proper combatant mindset.   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
Mitsuru-san seems to have steeled   
her resolve after observing us...   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - P-Please go easy on us...

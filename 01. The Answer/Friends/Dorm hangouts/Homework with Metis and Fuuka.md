Huh... This is the first time I've witnessed a school student fulfilling their educational obligations.   
   
Metis   
Surprised - Why do you write out all of the calculations involved instead of just the answer? It's inefficient.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - Um... I guess so you can prove that you know how to solve the problem correctly?   
   
Metis   
So providing the answer isn't considered sufficient proof that you know how to solve the problem correctly?   
   
Metis   
Surprised - Did I... say something wrong?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
You're distracting her.   
We should just let her work.   
   
Metis   
Sad - Oh... If you say so.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I'm sorry, it's just that this one is really difficult...   
Exasperated* - Hmmm...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Actually... I think it's because just finding the answer isn't the important part.   
   
Metis   
Surprised - What? But isn't that the goal of the assignment?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Well, that's part of it. But I think the point is to learn the process.   
It's about knowing which formulas or techniques will help you solve the problem.   
Happy - And once you know all that, finding the solution is easy, even when you start on another problem with different numbers.   
   
Metis   
I see... So studying is about acquiring specific mindsets.   
   
Metis   
Happy - Fuuka-san is a good teacher, isn't she, Sister? She makes things so easy to understand!   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Yes, she is.   
She's the brains of the team.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh, I'm not, really. You were just asking the right questions, Metis.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Hehe, I don't know about that. But I appreciate the compliment.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh, and also... I think it's fun to write out the calculations. It's like I'm having a conversation.   
How do I explain it...? When I figure out an answer, I feel like I understand the intent of the person who wrote the problem.   
For example, I can see when they're trying to mislead me, or I can tell they want me to use a certain formula.   
Happy - If I can figure out what the problems are getting at, I feel like I'll be more prepared for the exams.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Hm... Couldn't this apply to my navigation too? I think there are actually a lot of similarities...   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
Talking with us seems to have helped   
Fuuka-san come up with something...   
   
Metis   
So studying also helps with exploration...   
Then I suppose school must enforce a rather intense regimen.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - Oh, uh... Sorry, I may have given you the wrong idea...

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Thank you both so much for coming! You were a great help!   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Um... Sorry for making you come with us, Aigis-san.   
Sad - I guess, in the end, just the two of us could've handled it, so...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh, um... I don't think there's any need to worry about that.   
   
Ken Amada   
But we have to conserve our energy. We don't know how long we'll be stuck here...   
   
Aigis - Selection   
It could be a while...   
You're just overthinking.   
Don't worry, we'll escape.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Um, yeah... But I guess I might also just be too anxious about everything.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Yeah, you're probably right. I'm just feeling pretty anxious about everything.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - ...Haha, jeez look at me. I guess I'm just feeling really anxious about everything.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I understand how you feel, Amada-kun. I agree that we should try to conserve our strength and resources.   
Happy - But at the same time... It was really fun doing this with both of you! I think things like that are important too.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Huh...   
   
Ken Amada   
Yeah... you're right... I feel the same way...   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - I had fun shopping with both of you too!   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I did as well!   
Yes, fun is important.   
Let's do this again soon.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Yeah!   
Happy - Getting too worried can drain your energy too... So I guess this is also a good way to conserve it!   
Happy - Haha... I'm kind of embarrassed I was too closed-minded to realize that earlier.   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
It seems like Amada-san   
has had a great realization...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - "Closed-minded"...? Hehe...   
Happy - I wouldn't worry, Amada-kun. I think you're a very sensitive young man.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - "Sensitive"...? Uh, I guess I'll take that as a compliment...

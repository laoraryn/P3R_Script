Fuuka Yamagishi   
Aigis, there's something that I wanted to ask you.   
Is it possible that you can no longer activate Orgia Mode?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Yes, you're correct.   
Would you happen to know why?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Just as I thought. Something felt off when I was backing you up in combat...   
Sad - But it didn't look like you were malfunctioning. What could be the reason?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I thought something was off when I was backing you up in combat. As for what's causing it, well...   
Exasperated* - It doesn't look like you're malfunctioning, but... How should I put it...?   
It's almost as if you forgot how to activate it.   
Sad - Sorry, that sounds a bit silly...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It looks like Metis is able to activate Orgia Mode.   
Exasperated* - But I don't think you're malfunctioning. Honestly, it's almost as if...   
It's as if... you forgot how to activate it.   
Sad - Sorry, that sounds a bit silly...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Is something bothering you?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
About the members not here...   
Orgia Mode...   
It's nothing.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
About the members not here...   
Orgia Mode...   
What was that reading you picked up?   
It's nothing.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Kirijo-senpai is looking for anything that could give us a clue about what's going on.   
Exasperated* - This is just a theory, but... I think the area below the lounge was originally storage space.   
However, because the Abyss of Time appeared, whatever was stored down there got all jumbled up.   
Junpei-kun and Koro-chan are looking for any exits that we could use to get supplies.   
Happy - Since they're not planning to go too far, they'll be all right.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Hm, I honestly have no idea...   
Sad - It just appeared out of nowhere and then disappeared. I couldn't tell what it was.   
Sad - It does bother me a little, but for now we should concentrate on exploring the area. We have too little intel at the moment...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Looks like this place really isn't connected to anywhere outside...   
Sad - It's just like the dorms. Whenever we try to leave, some invisible force just pushes us back.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It looks like it'll take Kirijo-senpai a little more time to search for intel.   
I'm currently going through all the documents she's found so far, but it shouldn't take too long.   
There's a lot we have now, so I'm sure we'll find something.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The feeling I had when we all saw Amada-kun's memory is similar to the one I have when I'm backing you up in fights.   
It's right in front of you, but you have no physical body. All you can do is... watch.   
Happy - I never expected I'd be able to share that feeling with all of you.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I'm slowly going through all the documents that Kirijo-senpai found. However...   
Sad - A number of them are almost... religious in nature. They're a bit hard to sift through for useful information.   
Sad - Sorry, but could you wait just a little longer on this?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We used to use the bulletin board a lot, didn't we?   
Feels a little weird we're not using it at all now even though we're exploring again.   
I don't think any of us ever thought we'd have to continually explore like we are now.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I never really thought too much about it, but I wonder if everyone outside the dorm is okay.   
Sad - I just... thought about my family a little.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Looking away - I wonder if that figure we keep seeing has some kind of motive. And if so, what could it be?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Do you remember what Metis first said about this place?   
Sad - She said that the Abyss of Time was originally a small, self-contained space...   
Sad - That actually might be true. It matches up with the information on the notes we've found.   
Sad - I guess she was telling the truth this whole time...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I really don't think Metis is lying to us.   
Sad - I think... she just really wants to protect you.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We've all been saying that Metis acts pretty childish...   
But maybe she really is a child at heart. If that's the case, maybe we're the ones who should be reaching out to her.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Sorry for saying weird things while we've been exploring. We really don't know a thing about that figure...   
Sad - Sorry, I'll try to figure it out.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I count on you for a lot of things, Aigis, and... I understand that it's hard to make a decision.   
Sad - But if I side with you on this, then the others...   
Looking away - I just don't know what to do.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Looking away - I just can't decide... I'm sorry, Aigis.   
Looking away - What should I do?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Aigis, are you okay?   
Sad - No... Of course you're not okay.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I think... you made the right choice, Aigis.   
It's like what Yukari-chan said. I've thought about it and... my mind is made up.   
I'll support you, and I'll be your navigator... until the end.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
If it wasn't for you, I probably would've been swept up in all of this and wouldn't have been able to make my own decision.   
Happy - Even though it was such an important one to make. So... thank you, Aigis.   
Happy - Once we're done with this final battle, we can use the true key and...   
Happy - ......   
Exasperated* - Um... You know how to use the true key, right?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I do.   
......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - R-Right. Sorry, I got a little nervous there.   
Happy - But we'll be okay.   
Sad - ......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I'm sorry... You're probably more scared about this than I am, Aigis. And I just...   
Looking away - It's hard for me to put it into words, but... This kind of reminds me of January 31st.   
Looking away - ......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Once we're done with this final battle, we can use the true key and...   
Sad - I'm scared, but being scared isn't going to help.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, Aigis. Would you like to study together?   
We found that  in the Abyss of Time, didn't we?   
I just figured that in times like these, it's nice to have something familiar to fall back on.   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
Should I spend time with Fuuka-san?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I think I will.   
Not now.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Thanks. I actually invited Metis, too. She said she was interested in what high schoolers study.   
Happy - Shall we go, then?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Right, I guess you're busy.   
Sad - Well, if you decide you want to, feel free to join. I'll see you later, Aigis.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Are you still busy, Aigis? If not, we could study together... If you feel like it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, Aigis. Do you have some time right now?   
Um, I'd like to watch that  with you.   
It looks like it's simple enough, but I wanted to get your opinion on it as well.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Thanks! I wasn't sure if I'd understand all of it on my own, so I'm glad you'll watch it with me.   
Happy - Shall we go, then?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, that's too bad.   
Well, maybe we can when you're less busy? I'll see you later, then.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Are you still busy? I was wondering if we could watch that DVD together...

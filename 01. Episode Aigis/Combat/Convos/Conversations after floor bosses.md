Fuuka Yamagishi   
I don't detect any more Shadows on this floor... That figure's disappeared, too.   
Happy - There's a lot that still concerns me, but for now—good job, Aigis.   
Happy - That was our first encounter with a tough enemy... Do you think we'll be able to progress at our current strength?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
We'll be fine.   
I'm not sure...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - It's reassuring to see you so confident.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - But you did take down a strong foe just now without any major issue. Isn't that something to be proud of?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I'll also be providing you with navigational assistance. The going might be tough, but let's do the best we can!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We managed to take down that tough enemy. Do you think we should head back now, or keep going?   
Now that we've secured a supply route, we should be clear to proceed so long as we stay cautious.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Let's head back.   
Let's keep going.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
All right. No good will come of pushing ourselves too hard, I suppose. Let's resume once we're ready.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Okay, then. Let's try to keep riding this momentum.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Whatever you decide, Aigis, I'll be here to help. You can count on me.   
Happy - Okay then, shall we?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Phew, looks like the coast is clear. Now we'll be able to progress. Great job, Aigis.   
Happy - Your orders were spot-on. Impressive strategy, as always.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Thank you very much.   
I still have a lot to learn.   
It's due to your help, Fuuka-san.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh, no, I'm the one who ought to be thanking you!   
Happy - Hehe, that was a very Aigis response, though.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Hehe, I should've known you'd say that. You're so humble, Aigis.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Huh? Oh, um...   
Happy - I'm just a little flustered, is all. But thank you, Aigis.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Well, now that the enemy's down, shall we press on? I'm detecting some stairs nearby. Should we look for them?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - If that figure is the one calling the Shadows, then that means it intends to stop us.   
Sad - Does that make it our enemy...? What do you think, Aigis?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
It's an enemy.   
It might be an ally.   
I'm not sure.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - That'd be the logical conclusion... But what is it after?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Right... What we see here may reflect our inner thoughts, was it?   
Surprised - At least, that's what Metis said, if I recall correctly.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - That's fair... We don't have enough information to go off of, anyway.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I just get worried so easily. It's a bad habit of mine.   
Sad - Right now, let's focus on pursuing that figure since it got away.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Well, we managed to drive back the enemy. Do you feel like we've gotten back up to speed, combat-wise?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
We're in good shape.   
Not yet, no.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - That's great to hear.   
Happy - It seemed like you all were struggling a bit when you first started fighting again. I was a little worried.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Really...? Well, I guess you were fighting pretty frequently back then. It may take a while to regain that lost experience.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I think the fighting's only going to get more intense. Let's make sure we're all prepared before we keep going.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - The enemy's gone down. Well done, Aigis.   
Sad - That figure disappeared sometime during the battle, though. It's like it doesn't want to fight...   
Exasperated* - Is that even possible...? For a Shadow to dislike fighting?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Maybe it is...   
It's too early to tell.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Yeah, maybe. We don't know enough about Shadows to rule it out.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - You're right. Maybe it's just observing us for now, only to attack us later.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - There's still so much for us to learn...   
Sad - But now's not the time to dwell on that, is it? Let's get going, Aigis.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - We'll be able to make more progress now. Great work, Aigis.   
Happy - Well, now that we've taken down the enemy, what should we do next? Keep going?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Let's keep exploring.   
Let's head back for a bit.   
I'm not sure...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - All right then! No objections here.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - All right then. Remember, taking breaks is important.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - R-Right, erm...   
Happy - If you're not sure, maybe we should head back and prep before setting out. Better safe than sorry, don't you think?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - You can count on me to navigate!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Nicely done, Aigis. These fights are really tough...   
   
Aigis - Selection   
It doesn't seem that way to me.   
They really are difficult...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - It doesn't?   
Happy - Hehe, I was starting to get a little worried, but you just made me feel so much better.   
Happy - You really are something, Aigis.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - Perhaps we need to spend some time training on the upper floors to improve our combat capabilities.   
Sad - I know our priority is to make progress, but it's something to consider.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - You did great in that last battle, Aigis. Now we can move on.   
Sad - Oh, as for the things I'm looking into...   
Sad - Well, I haven't made much progress on that front... Sorry, Aigis.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Don't worry about it.   
That's a shame...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Okay... I'll try. Thank you.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - Yes, it really is... I'm disappointed in myself as well.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Just a little longer, and this will all be over... Soon, we'll be able to understand what's happening.   
Angry - I'll work even harder than before. Keep up the good work, Aigis!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Nicely done in that last battle, Aigis. How are you faring?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
No issues to report.   
I've performed better...   
I'm in top condition.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Hehe, good to hear. Remember not to push yourself too hard, though. Okay?   
Now let's get moving. We need to catch up with that figure.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Yeah, I'm sure... That was a really tough fight.   
Sad - There's that figure, too... Perhaps we should consider heading back to heal up before we keep going.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Hehe, I could tell. I knew you had it in you, Aigis.   
Exasperated* - We have to catch up to that figure though, so we'll have to press on.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to overstep! It's your call whether we keep going or head back, Aigis.   
Happy - Anyway, you're doing great!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hey, Aigis... Now that the fighting's over, could we talk for a moment?   
Sad - Do you think we might... have an encounter that we never thought possible?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Yes, I do.   
No, I don't.   
I'll worry about that later.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Y-You really think so?   
Exasperated* - Well... I suppose you never know what might happen when it comes to Personas and Shadows.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Ah... Yeah, I guess that would be the logical conclusion...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Um, I don't think that really answers my question...   
Happy - Hehe, you're right, though. We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Sorry, it's just... a lot's happened since we've come here, so I've been overthinking things.   
Happy - Well, it's back to navigating for me.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Looking away - After taking down those Shadows... the end can't be too far now.   
Sad - I'm honestly a little scared of what's waiting for us... Everything I imagine is downright terrible.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I'm also afraid...   
Everything will be fine, I know it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Really? You are?   
Happy - I see... But we still have each other.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Aigis, I...   
Happy - No, you're right. Everything's going to be just fine...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I'm glad I got to talk to you about this. It's helped me calm down a bit.   
Happy - Okay... Should we get going?   
   
---   
   
Metis   
Surprised - Wait... That figure up and disappeared, didn't it?   
   
Metis   
Sad - I should've paid better attention... How could I just let it slip away like that?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
It's not your fault.   
We had to focus on the enemy.   
   
Metis   
Happy - Sister...   
Happy - That's so kind of you! Thank you so much for cheering me up!   
   
Metis   
Happy - Right, our priority was taking them down... And we did, didn't we?   
Happy - I'm glad I was able to be of use to you, Sister! Phew, I feel so much better now.   
   
Metis   
Happy - All right, Sister, let's keep going. I'm going to be the best, most helpful ally you'll ever have, you'll see!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - So this place also has stronger Shadows getting in our way... It really does remind me of Tartarus.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - So, um...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
How are you feeling, Aigis? If you ever get tired or anything, be sure to let us know.   
All of this happening so suddenly... Being leader must be tough on you.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I really appreciate you.   
I'm fine.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - It's, uh... no big deal, really...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh. Uh... Okay.   
Well, I'm glad to hear that.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - ...Shall we, then?   
Happy - Looks like that figure's gone, too, so why don't we keep moving?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Made it out of that battle in one piece, at least. So, Aigis... How do you like being leader?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
It's not particularly difficult.   
It can be quite challenging.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Yeah, seems like. That was some great technique you showed in that last fight.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Have some more confidence in yourself. You had some great technique in that last fight.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well, we can move on now that the path's clear. That figure might prove to be a problem, though...   
Eh, we can worry about that later. We'll be good long as we take down anything in our way, right?   
   
Metis   
Angry - We're only going to encounter more obstacles chasing after that figure... Ugh, how annoying.   
Angry - Don't you agree, Sister?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
It is rather annoying.   
It's no different from usual.   
   
Metis   
Happy - Heheheh, we're on the same page, then!   
   
Metis   
Surprised - No different... from "usual"?   
Oh, I understand... You're referring to your past experience with the others, right?   
   
Metis   
Happy - Well, at any rate, let's keep moving! I'll be with you from beginning to end!   
   
Ken Amada   
A huge Shadow blocking our way... Just like in Tartarus.   
So what's the plan? Keep moving, or...?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Let's keep going.   
Let's turn back for a bit.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - All right, sounds good. We want to make as much progress as we can, after all.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Got it. Might as well make use of that supply route now.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Being the leader must be tough, considering all the hard decisions you have to make.   
Sad - I was always relying on him, too...   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - But I can't stay this way forever. Who knows? I might have to step up one day!   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Aigis-san, would it be okay if I learned from you?   
   
Metis   
Sad - Things got pretty tough back then, Sister. Did I, um... Well...   
Sad - Did I help?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Of course you did.   
Not particularly...   
   
Metis   
Happy - I did? Really!? Yay! I did the best I could, you know?   
Happy - Hehe, I'm so happy I managed to help my sister!   
   
Metis   
Sad - O-Oh... I'll do better next time...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I admit I was worried about our battle prowess... But we managed to dispatch such a strong foe without much difficulty.   
I apologize for having you take the reins so suddenly. From here on out, let's face the road ahead together, Aigis.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I'll be relying on you.   
This is all so overwhelming...   
I'd be fine on my own.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Hehe... There may not be much I can do to help, but I promise you I'll do the best I can.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm sure we all feel the same way. That's precisely why we're here together.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Hm... That may be so. Allow me to rephrase myself.   
Let us fight together—to better our odds of escaping this place.   
Surely, you can get behind that, non?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I expect we have a lot of ground to cover. Let's make sure we're all prepared and press on.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Sure gave us a run for our money, didn't it? But we put up a good fight.   
Looks like the way forward's clear now, so what do you say? Want to head out?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Yes, let's.   
I'd like to head back first.   
I need to think it over.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - All right. Let's get a move on, then.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All right, got it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sure. Take all the time you need.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You probably don't need to hear this from me, but you're the one who gets to set our pace here.   
Happy - After last year, I've gotten to know you and your abilities pretty well—and I have faith in you, Aigis.   
   
Metis   
That enemy was pretty tough, but it was still no match for us.   
Happy - Hehe, nothing can take me down, long as I have my sister to protect!   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Thank you, Metis.   
Don't push yourself too hard.   
   
Metis   
Surprised - Oh, um... No need to thank me for that!   
Happy - Heehee...   
   
Metis   
Trust me, I won't. Keeping you safe is practically second nature to me.   
   
Metis   
Happy - Let's make haste! That's what you want, right, Sister?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Man... We literally just took down those Shadows, but...   
Sad - Well, we're still trapped, still got that weird figure skulkin' about... The hell's goin' on in this place?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Time might not be passin' us by, but it sure feels like we've been stuck here forever!   
You hangin' in there, Ai-chan? Not pushin' yourself too hard, are ya?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I'm doing all right.   
I might be at my limit...   
What about you, Junpei-san?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Good, good. A lot's been happening, so I worry, y'know?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Yeah, figured. Anyone in your shoes would feel like they're in over their head.   
Happy - But, remember, we're all here for ya. It's totally cool to just reach out for help lightenin' your load, y'hear?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Heh, well, you know me. This ain't nothin'!   
Happy - Like, heck, that side quest I went on? Piece of cake. Got that done with style to spare!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Didn't quite turn out the way I was hopin' it would, but... Still!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Well, I should stop my blabberin'. We better get goin'!   
Happy - Time to rock 'n' roll, Aigis!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That figure's gone... At least, one would presume so.   
This probably goes without saying at this point, but there's more to this situation than meets the eye.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Well, now that we've overcome a tough enemy, shall we take a moment to regroup? What say you?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Let's keep going.   
Let's head back.   
I'm not sure...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Let's hurry, then. We might not be bound by time, but this place has proven to be both precarious and unpredictable.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Understood. There's no knowing what we'll face next, so we better use this time to prepare for the unexpected.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Your commands saw us through that last battle, though. You ought to have more faith in your judgment.   
Whatever you decide, we will follow you. Take all the time you need to think it over.   
   
Metis   
Um... Sister?   
Sad - In that last battle, I wasn't in the way, was I? I didn't do anything I shouldn't have, right...?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
You were fine.   
Well...   
Why do you ask?   
   
Metis   
Happy - Y-Yeah! Everything was totally okay!   
   
Metis   
Sad - Oh, I... I see.   
   
Metis   
Surprised - O-Oh, no reason! I was just, er... just wondering!   
   
Metis   
Angry - I have to prove that I'm not "just a kid"...   
   
Metis   
Angry - Sister... I'll show you just what I can do! You'll see!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - All right! The coast is clear!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Er, sorry... Kinda came off too strong there.   
Sad - Probably seemed like I'm in a rush. That must've been pretty weird.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
It was...   
Not at all.   
I understand how you feel.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Yep, thought so.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - Yeah? I hope so...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - You do, Aigis?   
Sad - Huh...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Anyway, I didn't mean to take up so much of your time... Should we get going?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well, that's that. Now we'll be able to move on.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Exasperated* - ...Hardly anything makes sense here, don't you think?   
There's no rhyme or reason to what's happening in this place. Everything's just... absurd. Right, Aigis?   
In spite of all that... Think we should keep trying to figure out what this place is?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Yes, I want to keep trying.   
Perhaps not at this time.   
I think that's up to each of us.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - I should have expected that.   
Happy - Heh. Not sure why, but it's more reassuring hearing you say it out loud.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Exasperated* - Really now...? Hm, all right.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - You're saying each of us needs to come to grips with it ourselves? Without the others influencing our opinions?   
You might have a point there...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I guess I'll just keep at it myself, then. Thinking, I mean.   
Sad - Seems like the right move to me, at least—maybe because of what we saw behind that door.   
   
Metis   
That figure's gone... It's run off every time we've encountered it, hasn't it?   
Happy - I don't know what it's after, but maybe your magnificent combat capabilities scared it off, Sister!   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I doubt that's the case.   
If only it were that convenient.   
   
Metis   
Sad - Um...   
Sad - I was only trying to make a joke... I'm sorry.   
   
Metis   
Surprised - Oh... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make light of the situation.   
Sad - I don't know for sure or anything, but... I have a feeling we'll see it again.   
   
Metis   
Sad - Well... Should we keep going? And chase after that figure.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - We only managed to take down that enemy because of you, Aigis-san.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
That's not true at all.   
Thank you, I'm honored.   
You also did great, Amada-san.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - You don't need to be so modest. I think you ought to hold your head up high!   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - No, thank you!   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - Oh, no, I just followed your lead...   
Happy - But, still, I appreciate it.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Should we get going, then? Looks like that figure's not even around anymore...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Damn, gone again...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Startin' to get real frustrated here. Sure, we get a glimpse of that figure here and there, but... Man.   
I'm worried about that figure and all, but maybe it'll do us some good to head back. What say you, Ai-chan?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Agreed, let's head back.   
I say we keep going.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Sweet, let's!   
Happy - Personally, I think taking breaks is super important. Gotta rest up so you have plenty of energy for tomorrow!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - ...But, uh, there ain't no tomorrow, huh?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Er, I mean, we gotta hold on and stay strong, so we can fight to see tomorrow...! Someday! C'mon, let's go!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Horrified - Wait, seriously!?   
Sad - ...I do see your point, though. Not like we can afford to take it easy, what with everything goin' on.   
Happy - Okey-doke! We'll have to push ourselves a little harder, so we can live to see tomorrow—eventually!   
   
Metis   
Are you tired, Sister? That enemy just now was actually pretty strong...   
It's okay to turn back if you're tired. You shouldn't push yourself too hard!   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I'm doing fine.   
Maybe we ought to head back...   
How are you doing, Metis?   
   
Metis   
Happy - Really? You are? Okay! I believe you!   
   
Metis   
Happy - I think that'd be for the best! My sister's safety comes first, after all.   
   
Metis   
Surprised - Um... Me?   
   
Metis   
Happy - I'm fine! Perfectly fine, even! Why, everything's just fine!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Excellent. It seems we're clear to proceed. Well done, Aigis.   
Actually, I wanted to ask you something: is being the leader taking a toll on you?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
No, I'm fine with it.   
It is, just a bit...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Is it now...?   
Sad - I feel as though I've been reinforcing that unyielding attitude of yours...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Ah... I doubt you had an easy time taking the reins, what with all the changes to your Persona abilities.   
Sad - But after taking our current situation into consideration, I can't see anyone else better suited for the role.   
Sad - Still, I'll be there to help you carry however much of that burden as I can.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I know I've given you a difficult job.   
Happy - Believe me, you'll have my utmost gratitude once this is all over.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Whew, we can finally press forward now. Actually, Aigis-san...   
Happy - Do you feel like we've been getting a little more confident in battle?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I do.   
I don't think so.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Me too.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Somehow, this seems even more frustrating compared to last year...   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Every time we go through another door, I feel like I come out a little... different.   
Happy - Well, maybe "different" isn't quite right since I haven't really changed—more like I'm regaining something I've lost.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Sorry for rambling. I'm not making much sense, am I? Please forget I said anything.   
   
Metis   
Happy - And that's another one down!   
Happy - Strong enemies are no doubt dangerous, but I love that I get to team up and face them at your side, Sister.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I like teaming up with you, too.   
Just me? What about the others?   
   
Metis   
Surprised - You do!?   
Surprised - Wow! To think, not just me, but BOTH of us are having fun together...   
Happy - Heehee, for some reason, that's got me feeling a little shy—but also really giddy!   
   
Metis   
Surprised - Oh, I hadn't really factored them in, but... Hmmm...   
Happy - I guess fighting alongside your friends could be fun. Obviously, not as fun as it is with you, though, Sister!   
   
Metis   
Happy - Anyway, we should head out. We still have to catch up with that figure.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Phew, made it out alive! Gotta say, that one was tough.   
Happy - So, Ai-chan... How would you score me in that last battle, out of a hundred? Give it to me straight, I can take it!   
   
Aigis - Selection   
100 points.   
60 points.   
I'm not certified to grade you.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Very happy* - Woo, knew it! All things considered, I did pretty good, yeah?   
Happy - You get me, Ai-chan! C'mon, let's keep this up!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Horrified - Ouuuch, my heart! I know I said I could take it, but to think—such a scathing review...!   
Exasperated* - Ai-chan, you can be real merciless sometimes, huh? But I guess that means we can trust you to be honest with us.   
Happy - Anyway, let's get going. I'll show you what I can do so I'll get in your good books! Just you wait and see!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Awww, don't sweat the small stuff! It's all good, we're just havin' fun!   
Very happy* - 'Sides, no number has ever been a proper representation of my true abilities!   
Exasperated* - That's why I've been wondering if I can get the teachers to leave the marks off my tests and exams...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - That figure disappeared on us again... It's so frustrating how we can't just chase after it once the fighting starts.   
Sad - And we can't afford any distractions in battle since these Shadows are so tough... Seriously, that last fight was exhausting.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Agreed, I'm worn out.   
Shall we rest for a bit?   
Let's keep at it!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - I feel you... And we've also got so much stuff weighing on our minds—way too much.   
Sad - Oh, whoops, I didn't mean to sound like a big baby. Sorry for making you listen to me whine.   
Happy - C'mon, let's get back to it!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Should we really? I don't think it's a good time, though...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - You know what? Maybe I am just way too tired, and that's why I sound like one big baby.   
Happy - We did just fight some tough Shadows, so maybe we should head back for a bit.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Yeah, guess that's all we can do...   
Happy - Thank you, Aigis. We just need to pick ourselves up and get back to it!   
   
Metis   
Happy - That was absolutely incredible, Sister!   
Happy - The further we go, the more you're able to refine both your combat and tactical abilities! You're so full of energy!   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Thank you.   
I don't think I'm that amazing.   
I was full of energy...?   
   
Metis   
Surprised - Oh, no, please!   
Happy - I was plenty happy seeing you fight, but having you thank me? Best feeling ever, heehee!   
   
Metis   
Angry - Well, I most certainly do.   
Angry - I've been observing you—objectively, of course—for some time now, so I believe I'm the expert here!   
   
Metis   
Happy - Yes, you most certainly were! Your engine displacement is really impressive. I better work harder to keep pace with you!   
   
Metis   
Surprised - ...Ahem, I'm aware I may have gotten a bit overexcited.   
Happy - Let's get back to exploring, Sister. Shall we get going?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
My form was feeling pretty good back there, like I'm finally getting back into the swing of things.   
Happy - Guess we must be closing in on something big. Heh, can't wait to square off with it and put my skills to the test.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I agree with you there.   
It may be a bit early to say.   
Are you not scared at all?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Scheming - Oh yeah? Well, it's about time we show 'em what for.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Exasperated* - Yeah, you might be right.   
But, hey, it's never too early to get into the right mindset.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I give as good as I get in every fight, no matter who I'm up against.   
Knowing yourself is just the first step in overcoming fear.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All right, let's keep moving. No reason to linger here if we want to get to the bottom of all this.   
   
Metis   
Happy - That was great, Sister! I'll never tire of fighting together.   
Happy - Should we keep going? Or would you rather head back for a bit?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Let's keep going.   
Let's head back.   
What would you like to do, Metis?   
   
Metis   
Happy - Understood. After all, our goal might be right around the corner!   
Sad - ...Though, it's hard to say exactly which corner, in a place like this.   
Happy - But that doesn't matter as long as I'm with you, Sister! Now let's keep exploring!   
   
Metis   
Happy - Agreed, this seems like a good time for a brief break.   
Happy - Exploring is important, of course, but I like spending our breaks with you, too!   
Happy - Shall we start heading back, then?   
   
Metis   
Happy - I want to do whatever YOU want to do!   
Very happy* - I'll be satisfied no matter what you choose, so just do whatever you think is best!   
Happy - But... It did make me really happy you asked.   
Happy - Thank you, Sister.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Aaand another stellar performance from Junpei-kun! Looks like he's got his groove back, folks, and he's downright unstoppable!   
Happy - You know you can always count on me, right, Ai-chan?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Of course I do.   
You can count on me, too.   
Hm...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Very happy* - Haha. Guess some things don't need to be said, huh? Glad to hear it anyway!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Scheming - Well, yeah, of course! We got each other's backs, through thick and thin!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Man... That stings more than an outright rejection.   
Exasperated* - Eh, all good. Just means I hafta show ya how reliable I really am!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Now c'mon, let's get goin'!   
Happy - We still gotta catch that figure, so let's move!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Now we'll be able to keep going... Let's hurry and find the next door.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Yes, let's.   
I'd like to head back first.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Good. I can't stand idling around, doing nothing. We have to break out of here as soon as possible.   
Looking away - I'm glad we agree on that, at least...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - But—   
   
Sad - Sorry, never mind. Slow and steady wins the race, right?   
Looking away - ......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Okay, path's all clear.   
Angry - What even is that figure anyway? All it's ever done is try to get in our way.   
Looking away - But we can't stop. We can't afford to turn back now.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Don't you think so, Aigis? We have to keep moving.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I agree.   
Rest is important, too.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - ......   
Looking away - I'm glad you understand.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - ......   
Looking away - You really think so...? I guess that's one way of looking at it.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sorry, I won't hold us up any longer... Let's hurry.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Aaand DONE! Now the coast's clear for more explorin'.   
Sad - Wonder what's even causing all this... 'cause I sure as hell don't know.   
Sad - Also, what's with the sour faces? Seems a little different than usual, no?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - C'mon, guys, chin up! Let's join forces and get this thing over with. Right, Aigis?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Right!   
I suppose...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Yeah, that's the spirit!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Oof... And there goes the wind outta my sails. You're killin' me here.   
Sad - Well, it's true we can't be too careful. Who knows what Shadows might be lurkin' in the... uh, in the open, I guess?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Look, I'm just tryin' to get us all on the same page here.   
So we can march forward united, y'know? I mean, we're a team. We oughta be able to do that much.   
Happy - Just try to keep that in mind, alright?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Now our path forward is clear. We're one step closer to discovering the source of all this.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - We know so little about the Abyss... That must've made it difficult to fulfill your role as the leader.   
Sad - Hopefully, as your ally and friend, I can at least help shoulder some of the burden...   
Sad - What are your thoughts, Aigis? Have I been helpful so far?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Of course.   
It's hard to say...   
Everyone is helpful.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Good. I'm glad to hear it.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Ha, I'm glad you were honest with me—quite brutally, too, in fact. It seems I need to pull more weight.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - ...But of course. I'm certainly not the only one there for you—we all are.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Though my offer doesn't only extend to you... After all, one never knows who might need a helping hand.   
Could you help me keep an eye on how the others are doing? I'd be very grateful.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Great, now we can move on. Judging by how many doors we've seen, I'm betting this next one will be the last.   
But my gut's telling me we're jumping right into the fire. You ready for whatever's waiting for us down there, Aigis?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Of course.   
Not at this moment...   
This might be fun.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Scheming - Heh. That's what I like to hear.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - That's fine. It's just a gut feeling, is all. Hard to predict what this place will throw at us, anyway.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Oh yeah? Guess it's true: when the going gets tough, the tough get going.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I might have been dragged into this against my will, but I'll see it through. I want this situation resolved as much as anyone.   
I won't regret the decisions I've made, no matter what happens from here on out.   
Let's move out, Aigis. Can't keep the root of our problems waiting, after all.   
   
Ken Amada   
We're closing in on whatever's causing all this now.   
Sad - How on earth are we going to escape this place, though? Are our memories the key to leaving...?   
But, hm... Something feels kind of off.   
But if the problem exists in the present, then wouldn't the solution be, too? You know, rather than in the past?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
You may have a point...   
Not necessarily.   
   
Ken Amada   
This place has really messed with my sense of time. Things that have already happened seem like they're happening all over again.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Yeah, I guess you're right. Some problems can be put off for the future...   
   
Ken Amada   
Sorry for talking your ear off, by the way. Let's keep going!   
   
Koromaru   
Very angry* - Awooo!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan sure seems excited! Maybe he knows we're approaching the end...?   
Sad - Oh... The end, huh...   
   
Koromaru   
Grrr... Ruff!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Eep!   
Exasperated* - Koro-chan, you startled me! Why the sudden barking?   
Happy - Although... that did kind of take the edge off, hehe.   
Happy - Thank you, Koro-chan.   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Arf!   
   
Metis   
We've defeated the Shadows, and it won't be long before we catch up to that figure...   
Happy - No need to worry, Sister. I'll be with you all the way.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Thank you.   
You don't need to be.   
Really?   
   
Metis   
Surprised - Oh, please don't thank me! Keeping you safe just comes naturally to me.   
   
Metis   
Sad - Please don't say that... It makes me really sad.   
   
Metis   
Happy - Yes, really. All the way to the very end, then after that, and after that.   
   
Metis   
Happy - Let's keep up the momentum. The last door should be nearby.   
   
---   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Awooo!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Koro-chan was in top form for that fight! Maybe he's giving it his all because he just met back up with everyone.   
   
Metis   
It sure seems like it. He's full of pride.   
And I can sense he has some affection for you, Sister... Hmph.   
   
Metis   
Angry - Tell me, Sister, which one of us is more helpful to you? And be honest! Please!   
   
Aigis - Selection   
You, Metis.   
Koromaru-san.   
I can't possibly compare you two.   
   
Metis   
Happy - Yes... Yes!   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Metis   
Angry - Oh, don't give me that look. It's like you're saying, "Fine, you can have this win." You're a dog!   
   
Metis   
Sad - I was afraid you'd say that... I suppose that means I'll have to apply myself more.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf, arf!   
   
Metis   
Angry - I-I don't need your sympathy!   
   
Metis   
Surprised - Really...?   
I... I wasn't expecting that. Honestly, I thought you'd choose one of your friends.   
Happy - But... You didn't.   
   
Koromaru   
Ruff!   
   
Metis   
You say some profound things... for a dog.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - It seems like everything's going pretty well! I hope we can keep up the momentum as we progress...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I admit I was worried about our battle prowess... But we managed to dispatch such a strong foe without much difficulty.   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Awooo!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - You did great, Koromaru. As for me, I've some catching up to do—since you all got a head start reacclimating yourselves.   
But with everyone helping Aigis, I was able to focus on my investigation. You have my appreciation for that.   
   
Koromaru   
Ruff!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I know I'm rather late, but... I hope you'll still have me at your side as we face whatever comes next.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I'll be relying on you.   
This is all so overwhelming...   
I'd be fine on my own.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Hehe... There may not be much I can do to help, but I promise you I'll do the best I can.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm sure we all feel the same way. That's precisely why we're here together.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Hm... That may be so. Allow me to rephrase myself.   
Let us fight together—to better our odds of escaping this place.   
Surely, you can get behind that, non?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I expect we have a lot of ground to cover. Let's make sure we're all prepared and press on.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf, arf!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Heh, you've still got some fight in you, I see. How encouraging.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What exactly is that figure? And why does it keep setting Shadows on us?   
Just what on earth is its motive...?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I've been mulling that over in my head for a while now...   
But I'm happy to leave the thinking to you. You're the brains between the two of us.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Exasperated* - Don't say that, Akihiko... Putting yourself down like that's a bad habit to develop.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Nah, I figured my strong suit's more beating things with my fists, so my brain's completely tapped out.   
While you were away, I ended up the oldest of the bunch, and I just had a hard time concentrating while looking out for everyone...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Aigis, you heard what Akihiko said... Is that right? He watched out for everyone?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
He certainly did.   
I don't recall that.   
......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Well... If you say so, then I believe you.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Exasperated* - Ah, perhaps there was a discrepancy in how you both perceived the situation, then.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Exasperated* - Well, your silence says it all. I do commend you for trying to do right by both sides, though.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
At any rate, it's true people have their own strengths and weaknesses. Let's move on. Akihiko, you take point.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Heh. Roger that.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You've got a real knack for leading, Aigis. It's made combat easier for all of us.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Thank you.   
I still have a lot to learn.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - You were especially impressive in that last fight. Sure put up a fight against some difficult enemies.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Striving for improvement, huh? I respect that.   
Happy - All right, time for me to get in the zone and follow your example.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Right, Takeba?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Hm... Yeah, I guess.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
What's that supposed to mean?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - I don't mean anything by it. It's just... Well, I haven't given it much thought since a lot's been happening.   
Looking away - I mean, I'm just more worried about that figure and all...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Right, it ran on us... Would be nice if we could catch it next time.   
The moment we see it again, let's drop everything and chase after it.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - ......   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Heh, handin' out brutal beatdowns is a breeze with my battle buddy around!   
Happy - Ain't that right, Koromaru?   
   
Koromaru   
Angry - Grrr...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Hey now, what's with the growlin'?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Aigis, me n' Koromaru make one deadly duo, yeah?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I'm sure you do.   
I wonder...   
   
Koromaru   
Angry - Ruff! Ruff!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - I'm no dog whisperer, but... I can see into his soul, and it's tellin' me those are ruffs of rejection right there.   
   
Koromaru   
Woof!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Awww, Ai-chan... And you too, boy? Cold as ice, the both of you.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Man... So my affections were just one-sided, after all? S'okay, whatever, that's fine. I'm cool. We're cool.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Hehe. Oh, Koro-chan, you silly boy...   
Happy - Your tail's been wagging this whole time!   
   
Metis   
Happy - And that's another one down!   
Happy - Strong enemies are no doubt dangerous, but I love that I get to team up and face them at your side, Sister.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - I know what you mean. There's nothing quite like fighting alongside other people.   
Happy - I was really impressed by everyone's teamwork and comradery when I first joined you all in battle.   
   
Metis   
Wow, really? Huh, I guess everyone feels the same way, then.   
   
Metis   
Surprised - Oh! But don't get me wrong, Sister—it's EXTRA special when just you and I team up!   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I'm flattered.   
You should befriend the others, too.   
That's rude to Amada-san.   
   
Metis   
Happy - Mhm, of course! I'm glad you understood what I meant.   
   
Metis   
Sad - Okay... If you say so, Sister.   
   
Metis   
Surprised - It is?   
   
Metis   
Sad - ...Sorry.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - How am I supposed to react to this...?   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant*   
   
Metis   
Koromaru-san is always fretting over the rest of the team after we take out a stronger opponent.   
   
Metis   
Sad - Or perhaps it's more apt to say that he's showing he cares... Hm.   
   
Metis   
It's as if he considers himself the alpha.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Well, he is one.   
He doesn't, though.   
But I'm the leader.   
   
Metis   
Angry - But you're the real leader here, Sister. Koromaru-san is simply excited from the battle.   
   
Metis   
That's what Koromaru-san would say, too.   
   
Metis   
Sad - But he still tries to do all this leader-y stuff... It just doesn't make sense.   
   
Metis   
Angry - Well, I know that, but Koromaru-san here...   
   
Koromaru   
Woof...   
   
Metis   
Angry - Hey, don't you feign ignorance with me.   
   
Metis   
Sad - ...I really don't comprehend any of my sister's friends.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - All right, now we can get back to exploring. Let's hurry to the next door.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - We just overcame a difficult battle, Yukari. Are you sure you don't need a moment to reorient yourself?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What say you, Aigis? Shall we push on or return and regroup?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I'd like to push on.   
I'd like to head back.   
I'm not sure...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - All right, understood. We'll abide by the leader's decision.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - ...Thank you, Aigis.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Agreed. That'd be for the best.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - Yeah, I get it... We all need a breather—to recuperate a bit before continuing.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You ought to be more confident in your decision-making skills. After all, you did get us this far.   
Take some time to assess our current situation, then make your call.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - ......

Ken Amada   
Happy - Phew... That was a tough enemy, but we managed to take it down.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
How are you feeling, Aigis? If you ever get tired or anything, be sure to let us know.   
Sad - With all of this happening so suddenly, being leader must be tough on you.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I really appreciate you.   
I'm fine.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - It's, uh... no big deal, really...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - Oh. Uh... Okay.   
Looking away - I'm glad to hear that.   
   
Metis   
Happy - Being leader might be tough, but my sister led the way brilliantly!   
Happy - It's all thanks to her that our fight went so smoothly. Don't you guys agree?   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Yeah. I was worried since we've been out of practice for so long, but now I feel confident that we can manage.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - ......   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - Yukari-san? Is everything okay...?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Uh, yeah! It's nothing!   
Anyway, it looks like that figure's gone, too. We might as well keep moving.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Oh right, the figure. What's really going on here, I wonder...?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Alright! This is some smooth sailin'! Feels like things are goin' pretty good so far, yeah?   
Happy - I was a little worried before we joined you guys, but it seems like things are A-OK!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Aigis has it together way more than you do. I was honestly really worried about you and Koromaru.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Horrified - Hrmph!   
Exasperated* - We totally had things together, thank you very much! And we tried really, really hard to do a good job!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - I'm kidding. I know we can count on you to make things happen.   
   
Metis   
Sister... Do those two dislike each other?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Yes.   
No, they're actually friends.   
I don't know.   
   
Metis   
Right... I thought so.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - No way, Ai-chan! We've got a real connection, y'know!?   
   
Metis   
Well, they don't seem like it.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - The connection we have runs deep, y'know? Take it from me—I'm a pretty deep guy.   
   
Metis   
Surprised - You aren't sure either, Sister?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Eh, a real connection doesn't always look one way, y'know? Sometimes you get along, and other times... not as much...   
   
Metis   
Sad - Nope. I still don't get it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That's all right. It's between us, anyway.   
   
Metis   
Sad - ......   
   
Metis   
Um... Sister?   
Sad - In that last battle, I wasn't in the way, was I? I didn't do anything I shouldn't have, right...?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oho, look at that! The li'l kid's fishin' for compliments!   
   
Metis   
Angry - Li'l k—!?   
   
Metis   
Angry - Sister, that's not true! You know that, right? I'm not a child.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I know you're not.   
I wonder...   
   
Metis   
Happy - Right? I'm not!   
   
Metis   
Angry - But he still says it...   
   
Metis   
Surprised - B-But...!   
   
Metis   
Angry - ...I've got my eye on you.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Wh-What? I was just jokin' around, y'know?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Junpei seems like the kind of guy kids would love, but they really don't care much for him, do they?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Horrified - What!?   
   
Metis   
Angry - I am NOT a child.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Yeah, yeah, I get it. Let's just get going already.   
   
Ken Amada   
You know... I've been wondering about something ever since we saw your past.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Hm?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - About Akihiko and me? What were you wondering, Amada?   
   
Ken Amada   
When did you both get tal—   
   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Uh... Never mind. It's nothing.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Cutting yourself off only makes people more interested in what you were going to say. Right, Aigis?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
You're right, it does.   
No, it doesn't.   
Let's just drop it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Doesn't it? You've already let the cat out of the bag, Amada.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Exasperated* - Ah...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well, I'm curious.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - How come?   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - I-I said it was nothing! Really! Nothing at all!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Exasperated* - There you have it. I think that's enough.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Exasperated* - Fine...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Amada, if you ever feel like telling us something, just speak up. You're too reserved for your own good anyway.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Right...

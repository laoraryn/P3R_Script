I wonder if Kirijo-senpai and the others are okay...   
   
   
Yukari Takeba      
I-It won't come in through the window, right...?   
   
   
Yukari Takeba      
Sorry, I know this is sudden and you were sleeping... I promise I'll explain later.

Yo, is this really the school...? Like, no joke?   
   
   
Junpei Iori      
But it'd be kinda funny if we were actually inside our classroom right now, huh?

Whoa! These open on their own? Sheesh, that scared the crap outta me!

I dunno what's going on, but we just have to smash the mirrors, right?

We just need to break the mirrors, right? Let's hurry and beat this thing.

Mitsuru Kirijo      
Perhaps it'll be easier to find the difference by taking a closer look...?   
   
Yukari Takeba      
We need to break any mirrors that don't show our reflections.   
   
Junpei Iori      
Uh, so which mirror do we break?   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
If a mirror doesn't show our reflection, break it.

Remember: break any mirror that doesn't show our reflection.

Akihiko Sanada      
Didn't think there'd be other Persona-users aside from us...

Those Persona-users just now... Better exercise caution around them.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Lucia couldn't sense them at all... Sorry, I'll concentrate on the Shadow.   
   
Aigis      
It seems this facility was in use during wartime.   
   
Yukari Takeba      
Let's just take down this Shadow and get outta here!

Huh? Why the hell are there tread marks?   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
These tracks on the ground seem to be made recently...

No time to waste. Let's end this before the Dark Hour is over.   
   
Aigis      
These tread marks... They're new.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
I sense the target two blocks ahead of you!   
It seems to be moving slowly downward.   
Don't let it get away!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
This place...   
It seems it was some kind of armory during the war.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
The target's gaining speed! It's continuing down the tunnel!   
Hurry and chase it down!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
The target's stopped!   
It turned around! It's waiting for us one block down!   
Please be careful!

It seems to be the type of Shadow that steals from the treasure chests. It's quite quick...   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
This treasure chest has already been looted. If only we could get ahead of that Shadow...   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
It's going after treasure chests. See if you can predict its next move.   
   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
That Shadow got the treasure chest! Try to see if you can cut it off before it gets to another one.   
   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
It took the treasure from this chest too! Let's try another one...   
   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
The Shadow is going after all the treasure chests! Let's ambush it at the next one!   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_RBOX_MITU   
It looks like there's a rare treasure chest on this floor. See if you can find it.   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_RBOX_MITU_2   
I sense a rare treasure chest on this floor as well. How fortunate.   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_MBOX_MITU   
There's a locked chest on this floor. If you can, try to retrieve its contents.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_RENEMY_MITU   
I sense a rare Shadow. Try to find and defeat it.   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_ALLBAD_MITU   
Hm... The Shadows on this floor are behaving strangely...   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_ALL_R_MITU   
There are multiple rare Shadows on this floor. This is quite an opportunity.   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_ALL_S_MITU   
This floor is full of strong Shadows... Stay on your guard.

I can't tell what's going on there from here, so be more careful than usual.

I'm sensing a distortion... It must be that door. It's dangerous, but may be worth exploring.

I'm sensing a valuable treasure chest on this floor. Please try looking for it.

Oh, there's a rare treasure chest on this floor too! That's lucky.

I'm sensing a locked treasure chest on this floor! We should probably try to find it.

I'm sensing strong enemies throughout this entire floor! Please be extra careful!

I can't see what's going on around you right now... Please be careful.

There. We can head down that way.

Shall we keep going?

Mitsuru Kirijo      
We're doing well. Let's keep up the pace.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
I trust you're not tired? Then let's be off.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
There's no room for carelessness. Stay alert.   
   
Aigis      
I am ready to move out at any time. Awaiting orders.   
   
Aigis      
All clear to proceed.

All systems are go.   
   
Aigis      
Resuming the operation.   
   
Aigis

Metis      
Look, look! A treasure chest!   
   
Yukari Takeba      
Could be something good in there.   
   
Yukari Takeba

Junpei Iori      
Yooo, check out that fancy chest!   
   
Junpei Iori      
Dude, ain't that a rare chest?   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
...That chest looks like it's worth opening.   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
Hey, that looks like a rare chest.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
That chest... doesn't look like the others.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
We don't see that kind of chest often. Let's not pass it up.   
   
Aigis      
Rare treasure chest located.   
   
Aigis      
Recommended course of action: identifying the contents of that treasure chest.   
   
Aigis      
Oh, there's a rare treasure chest.   
   
Aigis      
We've found a rare treasure chest.   
   
Ken Amada      
Oh! That treasure chest looks pretty rare!   
   
Ken Amada      
I bet we'll find something good in there. Let's open it up!   
   
Koromaru      
Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
That chest looks valuable! Let's open it up!

*sniff* *sniff* Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Oh! It's a rare treasure chest! Good boy, Koro-chan.   
   
Metis      
There could be something good in there...   
   
Metis      
Oh, that one looks important!   
   
Yukari Takeba      
We don't need to head back yet, right? Let's keep going.   
   
Junpei Iori      
One teleporter sighted! It'll take us back to the entrance, but I'm down to keep going.   
   
Junpei Iori      
...That'll take us back to the entrance, but you ain't wussin' out, right?   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
That's a one-way teleporter... But there's no need to head back yet.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
That teleporter can take us to the entrance. Try to remember where it is.   
   
Aigis      
A one-way teleporter is nearby. Will you return to the entrance?   
   
Aigis      
That's a one-way teleporter. I can keep going, but what should we do?   
   
Ken Amada      
That teleporter can take us back to the entrance, but I can keep going!   
   
Koromaru      
Ruff! Ruff!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Koro-chan found a one-way teleporter to the entrance!   
   
Metis      
Should we go back, just to be safe?   
   
Yukari Takeba      
I wanna keep going, but... might be better to head back.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Takeba is severely exhausted. Perhaps we ought to head back.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Yukari-chan looks exhausted. Don't overdo it, okay?   
   
Junpei Iori      
Hey, that's our ticket back. Whaddaya say?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Iori is low on stamina. Retreat could be a viable option...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Junpei-kun, are you okay? Maybe you should come back.   
   
Junpei Iori      
We ain't headin' back, right? Dude, I'm fine...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Junpei-kun, what's gotten into you...?   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
...That teleporter will take us to the entrance. What's your call, Aigis?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
It's important to know when to fall back. I'll trust your judgment regardless.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
I'm worried about Sanada-senpai... Maybe it's time to come back.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
This teleporter takes us to the entrance. I'd appreciate a chance to regroup...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Kirijo-senpai looks really worn out...! Would you consider heading back?   
   
Aigis      
One-way teleporter discovered... Shall we use it?   
   
Aigis      
That's a one-way teleporter. What should we do...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Leader, I'm worried about Aigis. Maybe we should stop here for tonight?   
   
Ken Amada      
Oh, a teleporter! Should we head back?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Amada-kun looks tired... It might be a good idea to head back.   
   
Koromaru      
*pant* *pant* *whine*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Koro-chan looks really tired... Aigis, do you plan to keep going?   
   
Metis      
Um, maybe we should go back soon?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
I'm getting worried about Metis. It might be good to head back now.   
   
Yukari Takeba      
Another one of those doors...   
   
Yukari Takeba      
Haven't we seen that door before?   
   
Junpei Iori      
It's one of those doors. What do you wanna do?   
   
Junpei Iori      
Oh, another one of those doors?   
   
Junpei Iori      
It's one of those doors... Not that I care.   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
...We opening this door?   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
Another one of those doors? Wonder what's behind it.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Is that... one of those doors?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
What should we do about the door? It's your call.   
   
Aigis      
Unidentified door spotted... How shall we proceed?   
   
Aigis      
We have discovered a door. Will you enter?   
   
Aigis      
Oh, a door... Should we head in?   
   
Aigis      
It's one of those doors... What should we do?   
   
Ken Amada      
...It's one of those doors. What should we do?   
   
Ken Amada      
Oh, a door... I wonder what's behind it.

Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Koro-chan found a door!   
   
Koromaru      
Grrr...

This signal... Is one of those doors nearby?   
   
Metis      
Huh... What's that?   
   
Metis      
It looks like some kind of strange door...

Look, there's a Shadow...

That might prove to be a difficult fight...

I am picking up powerful readings. Remain alert.

It seems like we've checked everything on this floor.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
This floor has been fully explored now. Good work, everyone!   
   
Yukari Takeba      
Okay, time to move on then?   
   
Yukari Takeba      
Since we've seen all there is to see, should we get going now?   
   
Yukari Takeba      
Roger that. Should we move on, then?   
   
Yukari Takeba      
Okay, then let's get going.   
   
Yukari Takeba      
Let's go, then. We should keep moving.

Guess that's it then... Let's move on.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
In that case, we're done with this floor... I'll let you decide what we do next.

Understood. In that case, let's move on.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
We're making progress. Let's head to the next floor now.

We have finished exploring this floor. Mad respect, as they say.   
   
Aigis      
Roger that. Shall we move on, Leader?   
   
Aigis      
We seem to have covered everything on this floor. Should we move on?   
   
Aigis      
Understood. Shall we move on, then?   
   
Aigis      
In that case, should we head to a different floor?   
   
Aigis      
We're making steady progress. Let's keep it up.   
   
Ken Amada      
So, we aren't missing anything? Then let's get going.   
   
Ken Amada      
All right then, time for us to move on.   
   
Ken Amada      
Hehe, kinda feels like a big accomplishment. Let's keep it up for the next floor too.   
   
Koromaru      
Woof woof!

You sure know how to explore, Sister!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Keep an eye on your health.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Hey, are you all right? How's your health?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Aigis, you're damaged...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Aigis, you need to heal up...!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Takeba, are you all right?   
   
Yukari Takeba      
I dunno if I can go on...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Takeba's about to collapse. Can she be healed?   
   
Yukari Takeba      
...Sorry, could you lend me a hand?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Yukari-chan, are you okay?   
   
Yukari Takeba      
I can take this... No problem...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Can anyone heal Yukari-chan...!?   
   
Yukari Takeba      
Sorry, but... I think I need a break.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Iori's low on health. Are you all right out there?   
   
Junpei Iori      
Whew, things are getting pretty rough.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Iori's taken heavy damage. He needs help.   
   
Junpei Iori      
Sorry, mind helpin' a brother out?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
I'm worried about Junpei-kun's health...!   
   
Junpei Iori      
I think I might be in a pinch...   
   
Junpei Iori      
This...? It's just a scratch.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Aigis, is there anything you can do to help Junpei-kun?   
   
Junpei Iori      
I could use a pick-me-up if you got one...   
   
Junpei Iori      
This is nothing... I'm fine.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Akihiko's health doesn't look so good...   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
Damn, guess I got carried away...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Can anyone get Akihiko some healing?   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
...This is one hard workout.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Sanada-senpai doesn't look so good... Heal him up if you can!   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
I'm still too weak...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Sanada-senpai, please don't act so rashly!   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
I'm not down for the count yet...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Kirijo-senpai... Are you going to be okay?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Ngh, I shouldn't have pushed myself...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Aigis, Kirijo-senpai is in trouble... She needs help!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Sorry... I'd appreciate some assistance.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Aigis's health is dangerously low!   
   
Aigis      
This is just a scratch... as they say.   
   
Aigis      
I'm sorry. This shouldn't have happened...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Can anyone heal Aigis...!?   
   
Aigis      
...That would be welcome, if possible.   
   
Aigis      
I'm sorry for the trouble...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Amada-kun, are you okay? Try not to push yourself too hard!   
   
Ken Amada      
Okay, but... I'm fine, really! I can handle this.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
I'm worried about Amada-kun... Please heal him if you can!   
   
Ken Amada      
Sorry about this. Please help me out...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Koro-chan looks like he's in bad shape!

No, I'm fi— Ngh! Maybe not...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Metis can't take much more... You should probably heal her.   
   
Metis      
Sorry I'm holding you back...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
You've lost a lot of stamina... Are you all right?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
...Don't be so reckless. You won't have enough stamina.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Aigis, your stamina is running low. Do you want to turn in for now?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Aigis, your stamina... Please don't overdo it!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Takeba's running low on stamina...   
   
Yukari Takeba      
I think I might've overdone it...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Takeba, don't push yourself too hard.   
   
Yukari Takeba      
I'm running low on stamina...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Yukari-chan, are you okay...?   
   
Yukari Takeba      
I'm fine... Come on, let's go.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Yukari-chan looks really worn out. Don't push yourselves too hard!   
   
Yukari Takeba      
Yeah, I'm feeling it... Wanna stop for a bit?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Iori... How's your stamina?   
   
Junpei Iori      
I miiight be havin' a little trouble.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Iori looks pretty exhausted. Are you all right?   
   
Junpei Iori      
Whoops. Got a bit carried away there.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Junpei-kun, are you okay...? You don't look well...   
   
Junpei Iori      
Whew... Guess I used my Persona too much.   
   
Junpei Iori      
I-It's whatever...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Junpei-kun is almost out of stamina... Don't do anything reckless!   
   
Junpei Iori      
N-Nah, I'm fine! I ain't done yet!   
   
Junpei Iori      
Ha, I could do this all night...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Akihiko looks rather exhausted...   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
Ngh, I might've overdone it...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Akihiko, you don't have enough stamina. Don't overdo it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
It's fine... I can still fight.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Sanada-senpai is out of stamina...   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
Dammit, I think I went overboard...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Sanada-senpai is running out of stamina! Be careful!   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
...Don't worry about me. Let's go.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Kirijo-senpai looks really tired. Is everything okay...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
I'm fine... But I could certainly use a break.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Kirijo-senpai's low on stamina... She's really exhausted.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Ngh, I can't quit here...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Aigis doesn't have much stamina left...!   
   
Aigis      
...I may have difficulties using my Persona.   
   
Aigis      
I can still fight... Just not optimally.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Aigis, are you okay? You're out of stamina...   
   
Aigis      
There are... no issues. I can proceed.   
   
Aigis      
I'm a bit fatigued... But I can keep going.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Hang in there, Amada-kun. Don't force yourself to keep going!   
   
Ken Amada      
I'm okay, but... I do feel a bit worn out.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
I'm worried... Amada-kun's stamina is really low.   
   
Ken Amada      
Sorry... I'm actually kind of tired.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Koro-chan, are you doing okay? Your stamina's low...   
   
Koromaru      
*whine*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Are you okay, Koro-chan...? Aigis, maybe that's enough for now.   
   
Koromaru      
*pant* *pant*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Metis is low on stamina. I hope she'll be okay...   
   
Metis      
I am experiencing some fatigue...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Metis seems worn out. You might want to consider regrouping, Aigis.   
   
Metis      
I'm fine! I can keep going! Um... Probably...   
   
Yukari Takeba      
Done. Now let's get going.   
   
Yukari Takeba      
Phew, still got it.   
   
Yukari Takeba      
Nice work, everyone.   
   
Junpei Iori      
Awww yeah! Who's up next?   
   
Junpei Iori      
Alright, now, back to business.   
   
Junpei Iori      
Aaand that's a wrap, folks!   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
Went off without a hitch. Let's get going.   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
All right, who's next?   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
Heh, that was a good workout.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
A victory well-earned.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
All right, let's be on our way.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Now then, let's get back to work.   
   
Aigis      
Target eliminated.   
   
Aigis      
We have seized victory. Let us proceed.   
   
Aigis      
Now then, resuming exploration.   
   
Aigis      
Enemies defeated—without incident.   
   
Aigis      
Good work, everyone. Now, let's keep going.   
   
Aigis      
Ready to get back to exploring?   
   
Ken Amada      
We did it!   
   
Ken Amada      
All right, now back to exploring.   
   
Ken Amada      
Whew... Guess it's time to move on.   
   
Koromaru      
Woof.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Good job, Koro-chan! Now let's get back to exploring!   
   
Koromaru      
......   
   
Aigis      
Koromaru-san seems to be pleased. Well done.   
   
Aigis      
Well done, Koromaru-san. Let's keep up the good work.   
   
Metis      
Okay, let's be on our way.   
   
Metis      
That was great, Sister!   
   
Metis      
No one can stop me and my sister!   
   
Yukari Takeba      
That went well.   
   
Yukari Takeba      
All right, let's keep that up.   
   
Junpei Iori      
...Nailed it! Nice going, Junpei!   
   
Junpei Iori      
Haha, perfecto!   
   
Junpei Iori      
...C'mon, let's go.   
   
Junpei Iori      
...Not like it was hard.   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
That certainly went well.   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
Good teamwork, everyone. Now, on to the next!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Perfect. Just what we hoped for.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
That was excellent leadership. Keep up the good work.   
   
Aigis      
That was a spectacular finish.   
   
Aigis      
We beat them to a pulp, as they say.   
   
Aigis      
Victory is ours! Now, let's keep going.   
   
Aigis      
Excellent teamwork! As always, of course.   
   
Ken Amada      
Nice! That went well!   
   
Ken Amada      
I'm always happy to team up with everyone!   
   
Koromaru      
Arf! Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Heehee! You looked really cool out there, Koro-chan!   
   
Koromaru      
Arf!   
   
Aigis      
Koromaru-san appears satisfied with our performance.   
   
Aigis      
...Yes, hopefully our next battle ends just as smoothly.   
   
Metis      
I'll always give my all for my sister!   
   
Metis      
I'm doing better than ever!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
These readings... Stay alert!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Be careful... Something feels wrong.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
This reading... It's the Reaper!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Aigis, something dangerous is approaching!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
...The Reaper's appeared! Get out of there!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Look out! Reaper's appeared!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Is this reading... the Reaper!?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
The Reaper showed up! Be careful, everyone!   
   
Yukari Takeba      
Ugh, we don't have time for this!   
   
Yukari Takeba      
Let's get out of here!   
   
Junpei Iori      
Crap, what do we do?   
   
Junpei Iori      
Oh shit, we better bounce!   
   
Junpei Iori      
Whatever, I can take 'im...!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Junpei-kun, don't be so reckless...!   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
Dammit, we can't fight now... It's too risky.   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
Guess our only choice is to fall back...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Dammit! Run, now!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
We've stayed here for too long...   
   
Aigis      
A formidable foe has appeared. How do we proceed?   
   
Aigis      
The enemy is dangerous. I recommend avoiding contact.   
   
Aigis      
The enemy is too strong...! Let's escape to a safer location!   
   
Aigis      
It's the Reaper... Let's leave this floor before it comes after us!   
   
Ken Amada      
That doesn't sound good... We better get out of here!   
   
Ken Amada      
We've stayed here for too long...! Let's escape!   
   
Koromaru      
Grrr...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Koro-chan has his guard up, too!   
   
Koromaru      
Woof!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
I think Koro-chan can sense danger, too!   
   
Metis      
It's too dangerous! We have to go!   
   
Metis      
We need to retreat, quickly!   
   
Yukari Takeba      
I'd rather not fight, but we might have to.   
   
Yukari Takeba      
It'd be better to just avoid it... What do you think?   
   
Junpei Iori      
We miiight stand a chance? Just barely, but we'll be fine!   
   
Junpei Iori      
Heh, if we gotta fight, I got your back, bro!   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
...This'll be fun. Bring it on.   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
We're in for a fight... But I've got this.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
We'll need to prepare ourselves if we engage in combat.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
I'd rather avoid fighting... But it's your call.   
   
Aigis      
An encounter will lead to a difficult battle. Let us stay on high alert.   
   
Aigis      
Though it may be a difficult battle... I'm prepared to meet it head on.   
   
Ken Amada      
...Wh-What's the plan? Do we even stand a chance...?   
   
Ken Amada      
If it's that dangerous, then it'd be better to run for it, right?   
   
Koromaru      
Grrr...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Koro-chan has his guard up, too!   
   
Koromaru      
Woof!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
I think Koro-chan can sense danger, too!   
   
Metis      
We should come up with a plan.   
   
Metis      
Hm... We might stand a chance, but...   
   
Yukari Takeba      
Not this... We gotta run!   
   
Yukari Takeba      
Great, just what we needed...   
   
Junpei Iori      
Damn, there it is!   
   
Junpei Iori      
Oh man, this is bad!   
   
Junpei Iori      
Hey, what now?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Please, just calm down, Junpei-kun!   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
Damn, it's out for blood...!   
   
Akihiko Sanada      
It's coming... You got a plan!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Not good...! Fall back!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo      
Ngh, just our luck...   
   
Aigis      
Powerful hostile approaching...!   
   
Aigis      
Danger! Fall back at once!   
   
Aigis      
A powerful enemy is approaching...!   
   
Aigis      
Everyone, I sense danger!   
   
Ken Amada      
We can't fight! Let's run...!   
   
Ken Amada      
Wh-What do we do!?   
   
Koromaru      
Grrr!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
It's the Reaper! Everyone, you need to escape!   
   
Koromaru      
Grrrrr...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi      
Koro-chan, look out...!   
   
Metis      
This is bad...!   
   
Metis      
Sister, get to safety!

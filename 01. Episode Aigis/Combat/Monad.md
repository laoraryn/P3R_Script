Fuuka Yamagishi   
Three doors... I wonder where they lead.   
Closed eyes, concentrating - Hm...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm detecting Shadows behind each door.   
Starting from the left and going right, the Shadow readings get stronger. But I'm picking up treasure chests with similar signals, too.   
So the leftmost one is the least dangerous, but has the smallest reward. And the rightmost one is the riskiest, with the greatest reward...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It's up to you to decide which way to go, but please keep that information in mind.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm not detecting anything in the immediate area, so we should be okay for now.   
Would you mind investigating those doors?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - MND_Monad04_02   
I suppose I should examine the doors.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Uh, please wait! There are only stairs up ahead.   
Very angry* - I really think we should figure out what's going on, so please come back for now.

A rare treasure chest lies beyond the door. Taking the parts and gems to the antique shop can grant you an advantage when exploring.

With the energy released from the Monad door, you have now obtained the map information of both the current floor and the next floor.

With the energy released from the Monad door, you have now obtained the map information of the current floor.

Fuuka Yamagishi   
There might be a treasure chest up ahead, but I sense an enemy presence there, too.   
If you're worn out from battling, don't push yourself too hard. Take some time to recuperate.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - It looks as though you've defeated all of the Shadows in this area.   
Happy - All we have to do now is open that treasure chest. Let's do it!

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Understood.   
Please be careful. It's easy to get lost here.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Understood. I'll continue to provide support.   
If it gets dangerous, don't hesitate to retreat.

Angry - Grrr... Woof! Woof, woof!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Hm...? That door... I don't believe it was there before.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Hey... Doesn't it look like one of those doors we find sometimes when we're exploring?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Closed eyes, concentrating - Huh...   
Closed eyes, concentrating - It does seem similar to those... Oh, but wait! This one looks like it leads to somewhere deeper than the others.   
Closed eyes, concentrating - I'm sensing strong Shadows, treasure chests, and... something else. I'm not sure what it is...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - So in other words, it's a great place to test how strong we really are!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - How is that what you got out of what she said?   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - It does sound like we might be able to find some good stuff in there, so it could be worth exploring.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It seems like you can enter and exit this one as much as you want, so keep that in mind if you do decide to go through it.   
Of course, deciding whether or not to use this door is up to you, Aigis.   
   
------   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Ah...! That reading I was telling you about before—it's close!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I knew it. They're the same as the ones we saw in Tartarus. But there seems to be more of them...   
We'll need to investigate further. Please try getting a little bit closer.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Where to begin investigating is up to you, but be sure to consider your current condition before entering.

It looks like the door has been unlocked.   
I can sense strong Shadows just beyond it... Please be careful.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It seems like it won't open... Do you see anything that I'm missing?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Wait! The door is glowing!   
But why all of a sudden...? Did you do something, Leader?

The tarot card reacted.   
It's the Major Arcana card...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - A tarot card you have is reacting to the door...?   
Maybe that card acts like a key for this door...   
Interesting... This door certainly works differently from the other ones we've seen.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I don't sense any danger in your immediate vicinity...   
However, there might be a strong enemy further in, just like with the other doors.   
Angry - If you feel like you're in danger, please leave quickly.   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
Should we explore Monad?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You're in a deeper part of the passage now.   
The passage is separated by doors and goes even deeper... Please be careful.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You can go further into the passage now. Why don't you take a look?

I'm ready.   
Just a moment.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - It's a strong enemy! Are you ready to fight?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - You'll have to defeat this enemy to move on... Are you ready?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - It's a very powerful enemy! Please make sure you're fully prepared for battle!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm detecting immense power beyond this point... Stronger than anything I've seen so far.   
Are you ready, Aigis?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I'm ready.   
Just a moment.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - Understood! Let's go, then!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Understood. Let's come back when we're prepared.

I sense a treasure chest. It looks like there's one at the end of the room.   
It might have something valuable inside... Do you really want to leave without it?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There's still an unopened treasure chest... Do you want to leave without it?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - This place is...!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Sorry, but could you spend some more time exploring this area?   
Sad - My powers aren't strong enough to see everything in there.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Could you explore a little further in?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There's still an unopened treasure chest. I think you should open it before leaving.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - It feels different in here compared to the outside.   
Surprised - This space is unstable and the walls are moving like waves...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - My powers aren't working very well here.   
Sad - I can tell that it's not a very large area, but please still be careful.   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
The door is tightly sealed.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Can you please return? I'd like to go through what we know about that door.   
Luckily, there seems to be a teleporter nearby.

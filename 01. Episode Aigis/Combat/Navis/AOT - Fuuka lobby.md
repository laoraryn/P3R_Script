I'll support you all from here. Now, is there anything I can do for you?

Anything else?

Happy - Let's see... You're about to start exploring, right? Let's proceed slowly but surely.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Please explore as much as you can for now.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There must be something to that floor... Could you look into it some more?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You should be done exploring this area. Could you maybe try another door?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - A new door... And it'll take us to where we'll be fighting.   
Sad - What do I do...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - ...Sorry. I'm still trying to process all of this.   
Looking away - Is this really for the best...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - We'll have to fight Yukari-chan and Kirijo-senpai next... Then it'll all be over.   
Angry - Stay strong, Aigis. I'll be with you all the way.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - Whatever's on the other side of that door... We'll all face it—together.   
Very angry* - I might not be able to do much aside from providing support, but I want to witness the truth for myself!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh, about what you found during your exploration—I'd like to take a closer look over at the dorm.   
Happy - Could you give me some time once we're back? Thanks, Aigis.

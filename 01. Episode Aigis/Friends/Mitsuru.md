It doesn't seem as though this problem will simply resolve itself. We may have to fight.   
Don't worry. Whatever the cause may be, we'll overcome it. We've already saved the world once, after all.   
That said... I'll be investigating on my own for some time. I'll leave the rest to you, Aigis.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looks like we won't have to worry about supplies now. I didn't expect us to find a solution like this, though.   
The Abyss of Time, huh...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
They reflect the minds of those who pass through...   
Then if there are other doors that lead to the past, will we witness more of our personal memories?   
What does it all mean...? And why would we be the cause of all this?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I apologize I was gone for so long. I'll be joining the expedition from here on out.   
You've been doing well as the leader, though. I'll try my best to make up for my absence.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I never thought about how much of my time as a student was dedicated to finding a way to eradicate the Shadows.   
"She'll spend her prime years bound to our vile legacy"...   
Sad - ......   
Oh, sorry. Ignore that. It's just something I heard once, when I was younger.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Amada's, then Akihiko's, and now Iori's past...   
And each event took place before they started fighting Shadows... Is that how they're all related?   
Is it linked to the "reason" that will help us get rid of the Abyss of Time...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We still don't know what that figure's motive could be... I can't deny it's been weighing on my mind.   
But our current objective is to explore the Abyss of Time.   
We should keep moving.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looking away - I vowed to protect my father... But I couldn't even manage that.   
Looking away - Every time I want to protect someone... I lose them.   
...But no longer, not anymore.   
Aigis, would you lend me your strength?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yukari seems to believe you inherited your new Persona abilities from him.   
What do you think, Aigis? Is it possible?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I have no idea...   
Inherited...? But how?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I see.   
Sad - Well... All I wanted to say is that Yukari's words may have had an edge to them, but she doesn't mean you any malice.   
Sad - She lost her temper since he meant so much to her... But I suppose he meant just as much to you as well.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Apologies, I didn't intend to distress you. I'm sure Yukari didn't mean any ill will toward you, either, but...   
Sad - You are the only one who heard his final words... She must be taking it especially hard.   
Sad - Sorry, I know this couldn't have been easy on you, either, but I only wanted you to understand where she's coming from.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sorry if I troubled you. I'll talk to Yukari when I get the chance.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Just as I said earlier... I will be joining Yukari in this fight.   
I'm sorry it turned out this way. I know it's irresponsible of me to choose sides after appointing you as our leader...   
Very angry* - ......   
Very angry* - But I won't budge on this... That's why there's no need for you to hold back. Come at us with everything you have.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Thank you for stepping up as the leader... You've done well.   
Happy - We may have fractured at one point, but you're the reason why we're all together again.   
You have my gratitude. I apologize for giving you such a heavy burden.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looking away - Also...   
Very angry* - There's something I need to discuss with you, Aigis—about your life.   
Very angry* - You are one of the people I want to protect. That's why, next time... You can come to me for anything.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Oh, hello.   
I was thinking about taking a short break. Would you like to join me?   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
Should I spend time with Mitsuru-san...?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I think I will.   
Not right now, no.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Thank you. I thought it would've been rather dull if it were just me alone.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I see. Well, let me know if you ever need the company.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Oh, Aigis. Koromaru wanted me to play with him.   
Since we came across that  in the Abyss, I thought I'd indulge him.   
Would you care to join us?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Then shall we get going? Koromaru ought to be waiting.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I see. Perhaps another time, then.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yes? What is it? Did you want to play with Koromaru?

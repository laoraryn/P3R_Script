A little light reading's not too bad every now and then. Helps keep your mind sharp.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Agreed.   
That's surprising.   
Is something the matter?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Some ideas are hard to grasp when you're stuck in your head.   
Seeing them written out as words on a page can help you understand things from another angle.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Heh, I wouldn't call myself a big reader, but I admit there's a lot you can learn from books.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Heh. Nothing gets by you, huh? But yeah, I guess you could say that.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Do you remember that conversation we had with Amada? About sticking to a training regimen?   
I basically told him the confidence you build from conquering milestones will see you through future hardships...   
Sad - I was so sure of myself, but there's a nagging doubt in my head questioning if the effort I put in is all for nothing.   
Sad - Having more confidence in yourself is just easier said than done.   
Do you feel the same, Aigis? Would you say you're confident in yourself?   
   
Aigis - Selection   
I wish to be.   
I can't say.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Good answer. The first step to building more confidence is to have the right attitude.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - It's not an easy question, is it? Not that it should be, I guess.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - As for me... Well, I'm not sure of the answer myself.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All I know is that I can't stop pressing forward.   
Or else all the blood, sweat, and tears I shed would be wasted. All the effort I put in, just gone down the drain.   
Angry - I can't let that happen. Those days I spent training have to mean something.   
Angry - The same thoughts were running through my head last year... when we fought at his side.   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
It seems that Sanada-san's   
passion has been rekindled...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Thanks for the talk. Getting this off my chest really helped me get my head straight.   
Happy - I'll make it up to you in our next battle.

Deepening your bonds will bolster the strength of your Personas. Do try and forge as many connections as...   
......   
Surprised - Oh, my apologies. I got rather caught up in the motions. Force of habit, I suppose.   
Considering that you've already forged such tightly-knit bonds with your comrades, I implore you to mind my master's words:   
"Strength of heart, when united, is barred by no door."   
   
Elizabeth   
Please bear in mind that the current selection of requests is not all of them. I shall be adding more in the future.   
Oh, but hm... The concept of time holds no meaning here. Very well then, I'll simply add more at my own pace.   
Note that some may only become available upon completing other requests.   
Should there be a number missing, then please assume that there may be a hidden request.   
   
Elizabeth   
No matter how long or hard I mull it over... I'm afraid the solution still deludes me.   
No, not "deludes." Perhaps, it illudes me? Or is it "alludes"...?   
Sad - ...My, the word simply escapes me.   
   
Elizabeth   
By the way... It appears that your companions have regained the power they once possessed.   
By searching within oneself, bonds are forged, strengthened... and can even become a source of power.   
Happy - ......   
How fascinating, indeed. You have my gratitude for sharing such a revelation.   
   
Elizabeth   
Do you possess the power to overcome any adversity as well? Just as he did...?   
It seems all I can do is watch over you from here, so please... Do journey with caution.   
   
Elizabeth   
What power will you exhibit? What path will you choose?   
......   
And how does it all relate to me? I admit, I'm rather looking forward to the answer.   
I sincerely wish you the best on your journey.   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - Hm... It appears you have grown spectacularly.   
I believe you will now be able to wield a veritable plethora of Personas.   
You have made splendid progress, in fact. Perhaps you may even—   
   
Sad - ......   
Surprised - ...Oh, my apologies. I seem to have gotten a bit lost in thought.   
......   
Well... In any case, I commend your efforts.   
Continue to hone your Personas, and reach for even greater heights...   
   
Elizabeth   
I must say... What curious scenery. There truly is nothing but sand as far as the eye can see.   
I've heard that some people even spend their days in such an environment.   
What sort of lives do they lead, I wonder? I would love to witness it myself.   
Happy - No doubt their lifestyle must be drastically different from those I've observed at Paulownia Mall...   
   
Elizabeth   
Endless sand... Sand... at the beach.   
Were there a large body of water here, could it be considered an ocean?   
Sad - ......   
Sad - ...Never mind me. I doubt I'm capable of recreating an exhilarating summertime romance solely by myself.   
Sad - So please, forget I said anything.   
   
Elizabeth   
I have been tallying the number of Shadows you've defeated up to this point, naturally.   
......   
Indeed I have—undeniably, irrefutably, and indubitably so. You can trust in my impeccable record-keeping prowess.   
   
Elizabeth   
When exactly did that door appear here...? Why, it must possess exceptional skill to have escaped my notice.   
That which exists beyond the threshold overflows with danger... Does it stir the challenger's spirit within you?   
If you dare explore its depths, I only pray that you are adequately prepared.   
   
Elizabeth   
I couldn't help but notice your attire...   
......   
Ah, I see. So that was a possibility—should the need arise...   
Happy - Hehe, pay me no mind. The look suits you.   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - So, after passing through that door, you met with someone who could use a Persona?   
Intriguing... So that sort of thing may transpire in this place.   
Perhaps nothing is truly beyond the realm of possibility here.   
Just as how you've encountered that mysterious figure time and again throughout your long, perilous journey...   
   
Elizabeth   
When the time is right, could I perhaps ask you to—   
   
......   
Sad - No, that'd be wrong of me. This matter seems to be weighing more heavily on my mind than ever before...   
My apologies. Please allow me to continue watching over you.   
   
Elizabeth   
Now that you've demonstrated your power and showed me your potential...   
I confess, I may have been somewhat stubborn. Such hardheaded behavior is almost laughable in hindsight.   
Happy - Hehe, not that I'm opposed to having a hard head. In fact, I rather like how powerful it sounds.   
Happy - Consider this: what would happen should I butt my head into my master's nose...?   
Unfortunately, I'm afraid the answer will have to wait. My attention is currently occupied by another matter.   
And to that end, I shall continue to watch over you and your journey.   
   
Elizabeth   
If you have any business related to Personas, please visit the Velvet Room.   
My personal requests... seem to have all been fulfilled already. Thank you for your hard work.   
   
Elizabeth   
Completing tasks evokes a feeling of satisfaction. I presume you experience the same sensation as well?   
Happy - ......   
...Perhaps being driven by emotions is not such a terrible thing after all.   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - Despite having completed my every request... you still wish to speak with me?   
Happy - Hehe. My, what an honor. Then shall I regale you with tales of my master's strange habits?   
...Though perhaps I ought to save them for another time.   
   
Elizabeth   
You wish to talk?   
......   
Sad - Apologies. It seems my mind immediately went blank...   
Sad - ...Though I'm not clear as to why.   
Sad - ......   
   
Elizabeth   
You wish to talk?   
......   
It feels as though my mind is stuck on a loading screen. I can't seem to think of anything...   
Sad - ...What a tragic state of affairs.   
   
Elizabeth   
One thing I've learned about myself is that I seem to get lost in my thoughts more often as of late...   
......   
Sad - This is the first time I've ever encountered such a problem.   
   
Elizabeth   
While it's true I've had a lot on my mind, were you to ask me why, I couldn't give you a proper answer.   
......   
Sad - Am I... bedazzled?   
Surprised - Or perhaps... bifurcated?   
Well, whatever I may be, the answer is likely to be of little to no significance... I hope.   
   
Elizabeth   
Truth be told, I am quite fond of singing.   
It is the perfect means of expression, one that allows me to give form to the fire within my being.   
And yes, I delight in the art of wordplay as well, hehe.   
   
Elizabeth   
You are not human. The two of us are similar in that respect... As such, I shall be watching over you with great interest.   
I wish you the best of luck.

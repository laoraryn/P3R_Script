Dorm PA   
Attention, all students in the dormitory. The cafeteria will be closing in thirty minutes.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Oh, crap...   
Sad - Whatever...   
   
Classmate   
Oh, there you are! We went to your room to look for you.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, sorry, um... I don't think I'm going today. It'll be crowded anyway.   
   
Classmate   
Wait, is that your stuff? Have you not even been to your room since we got back?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, uh... Yeah, I guess not.   
   
Classmate   
Really? So you've just been spacing out here for hours?   
Is... something going on?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, no, I'm fine. It's nothing important.   
Looking away - Just kinda hard to believe it's been, what, four years since I got here?   
   
Classmate   
Oh yeah, I know what you mean. It is kinda depressing.   
Like, why do we have to stay cooped up in a dorm for what should be the best three years of our lives?   
And our first year's almost done! High school will be over before we get to have any fun...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - ......   
   
Classmate   
Well, try not to let it bother you too much. We'll get through it.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - Yeah, it'll all be over soon, huh...?   
Looking away - Stupid... Of course I wouldn't find out anything about Dad just by going to school...   
Looking away - If even the police and the media haven't found anything new...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - Ten years already...   
Looking away - ......   
Looking away - Maybe I'd be better off giving up...   
   
Woman's Voice   
Excuse me. You're Takeba-san, yes? The first-year?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, uh, yes.   
   
Residence Director   
Oh, good. I'm glad I found you. There's a letter for you.   
It actually came yesterday. I'm sorry for the late delivery.   
Honestly, it took me a while to make out who it was addressed to.   
   
Residence Director   
[cut 2 4 1]   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - What...!?   
   
Residence Director   
It's from an Eiichiro Takeba. Is he a relative?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - That... This is impossible...!   
Surprised - "Commemorating the opening of the Moonlight Bridge"... This is from ten years ago...!   
   
Residence Director   
Wh— Takeba-san, wait! I need your signature!   
And you left all your things here! Takeba-san!

Mitsuru Kirijo   
You were all alone, trying to combat the Kirijo Group's deceptions, for so long...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - I was just...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hm... It would've been nice if the scene from your past could have included your father.   
I would've liked to meet him.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It doesn't matter. No point dwelling on the past.   
I'm tired of dealing with Shadows. Let's just hurry and get this over with.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looking away - ......   
Looking away - Yukari... Remember not to push yourself too hard.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - ......   
Looking away - You know how... Aigis has the same power as him?   
Looking away - That has to mean that she... got something from him. Even if she doesn't know it...   
Looking away - I guess... I want some kind of proof that I'm making progress.   
Looking away - I made a promise to him...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yukari...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Now that I've seen my own, I know for sure that we were right...   
About how all the memories we've been seeing have something in common.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
So you mean... The night after what we just saw...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Amada-kun's memory, Sanada-senpai's, Junpei and Koromaru's...   
Mitsuru-senpai's was the most obvious.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Uh, I don't think I'm following...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
What we've been seeing are the moments that gave us our reasons for awakening to our Personas.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It fits. The majority of us were there for Fuuka's awakening, and Aigis and Metis could always use theirs...   
That would explain why we haven't been shown their memories—there was no need.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - But if that's what it is... then why those memories specifically?   
Sad - Is it saying there's a lesson we need to learn from our reasons or something?   
Aigis-san, what do you think?   
   
Aigis   
Hm... Well...   
   
Metis   
Sad - ......   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Yo, li'l sis!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Don't act like this doesn't involve you. C'mon, let us know what you think too.   
   
Metis   
Sad - Why? It's not like I can talk about the past with you all.   
Sad - I don't know anything about it...   
   
Aigis   
What's wrong?   
   
Metis   
Sad - Nothing. It's true, that's all.   
Sad - I just... I asked you to not leave me behind, but...   
Sad - Unlike all of you, I don't know anything about your pasts, so... It's like I'm the only one who doesn't belong...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oh, you're feelin' left out, huh? You really are just a kid inside.   
Happy - Makes sense now why you got all well-behaved when we said we'd leave you behind before.   
   
Junpei Iori   
[cut 11 2 1]   
   
Metis   
Angry - I'm not "just a kid."   
   
Aigis   
You may not know anything about us, but it's true the other way too.   
You must have memories that we know nothing about.   
Like the memory of when you discovered your emotions.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Isn't it about time you let us in on some of those memories?   
   
Metis   
Sad - ......   
Sad - But... But I don't...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh. It closed.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sheesh...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Metis, you may be misunderstanding. It's not as though our pasts have been purely enjoyable.   
In fact, there are likely more painful memories than pleasant ones.   
   
Metis   
Closed eyes, concentrating - That's clearly not true.   
   
Metis   
Closed eyes, concentrating - All the things you talk and laugh about are from your past.   
   
Aigis   
......   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
She certainly doesn't mince words... And   
this time, that trait forced a realization.   
It occurred to me for the first time...   
That the reason time stopped may   
have something to do with us...

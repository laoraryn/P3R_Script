Aigis - Thoughts   
Before everything   
changed...   
March 31st, 2010,   
1:30 PM...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...Hello?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hey, Yukari-chan? It's me...   
Um... Are you coming today?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, um... Didn't you see the message I left on the board? I have cram school today...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I know... But...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I already left my stuff at the dorm, so there's no need for me to be there in person, right?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I suppose not, but...   
Sad - Are you sure?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah... I'm sure.   
Oh, sorry... Break's almost over. I gotta go.   
Tell everyone I said hi, okay?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Yukari-chan's not coming after all.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sanada-san said he'd be training at the gym, so I don't think he's coming either...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Man, what is up with those two?   
Exasperated* - This is the last day we have before the dorm closes down!   
Exasperated* - With all our memories of this place, you'd think they'd wanna see it off together, y'know?   
   
Koromaru   
Sad - *whine*   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - It is what it is. Everyone deals with things in their own way.   
It's up to each of us to choose our own path from here. We can't deny them that.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Yeah... I guess you're right.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Besides, I can hardly blame them.   
Things have only been getting busier... If I didn't have to reclaim these, I may not have made it here myself.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Guess it's finally time to say goodbye to our Evokers...   
Kinda bums me out, but it's not like we got a use for 'em anymore.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Lessee... Two, four... Wait, how many are there supposed to be?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Aigis...   
   
Aigis   
I believe this is all of them.   
   
Ken Amada   
Huh...? You had one too, Aigis-san?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That's right... You had his for safekeeping...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - ......   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - ......   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - H-Hey, c'mon... Let's not get all down in the dumps about it.   
I don't think... he would have wanted to see us like this.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sorry. You're right... We've already said our goodbyes.   
Sad - It's just, I can't help wondering... Why?   
Sad - There didn't seem to be anything wrong with him. It just looked like he fell asleep, didn't it?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - He must have used up the rest of his power to protect us... at the final battle.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - I don't think it's worth speculating on the reasons.   
   
Aigis   
The one thing I feel certain of... is that he wouldn't have blamed any of us for what happened.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - ...Yeah. Ai-chan's got that right.   
Y'know, I'm glad to see you're still hangin' in there, Aigis.   
It really seemed like you cared about him more than anything in the world.   
   
Aigis   
I'm... somewhat surprised as well.   
It's possible I won't feel the full impact until I'm settled back in at the lab tomorrow.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Huh? The lab? Are you planning on commuting from there next semester?   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Oh... No, I...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Aigis is returning to the lab for good. She... won't be enrolling as a third-year.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Seriously!? Why? It's been fine this whole time, hasn't it?   
   
Aigis   
Sad - The decision was mine. I'm sorry I didn't mention it sooner...   
Sad - I enjoy being with you all, but it's time for me to find my own way of life.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Oh, but don't worry... You can come visit me whenever you wish.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Aigis...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Think of it as a new beginning for her.   
Anyway... We seem to have gotten off track, but I didn't mean for this to be a sad occasion.   
I've ordered top-quality sushi for us all. The same as last time, actually.   
We may not have the full team with us, but let's have a nice dinner here tonight.   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - Oh, that would be great!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Top quality!?   
Happy - I mean, uh, no objections here!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - You'll join in too, right, Aigis?   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Of course. I won't miss this chance to spend more time with you all.

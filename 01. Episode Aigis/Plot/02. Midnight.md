The number of Apathy Syndrome cases is down from last month, which seems to mark an end to the strange illness.   
In spite of this, surveys have shown that the public's everyday stress levels remain high.   
According to an investigation by the Ministry of Health and Welfare...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Whoa, when'd it get so late?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's almost midnight...   
It's hard to believe we passed the evening so quickly, even without doing anything in particular.   
I suppose it's because sitting here with you all brings me back to the time we spent together.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I think I know what you mean.   
I have so many memories of this lounge that I find myself wanting to come back to it.   
   
Ken Amada   
It's the same for me. When I'm here, I can't help but reminisce on those days.   
Happy - It's funny, since... Well, the things that happened back then weren't exactly pleasant.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - I getcha on the past and all, but... Isn't there something still off about the present?   
Sad - I feel like everywhere I go, I see people goofin' around like nothing else matters.   
Sad - It's like Strega's dumb ideas never got out of their heads, y'know?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - I mean... Is that the kind of world we almost died to protect?   
   
Ken Amada   
Wow, you've really grown up, Junpei-san!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - I don't need to hear that from you!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's out of our hands, I'm afraid.   
We may have prevented the Fall, but there's only so much we can do to reform society.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Yeah, I guess. But still...   
   
Newscaster   
...And that's all for the weather.   
At the tone, the time will be 12 AM.   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - What was that!?   
   
Koromaru   
Angry - Woof! Rarf arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Right at midnight... No way, is it the Dark Hour again!?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Very angry* - Nah... Everything's fine out there!   
   
Aigis   
Wait... The news!   
   
Newscaster   
Good evening.   
It is now March 31st. Here are the latest news reports...   
   
Aigis   
Huh? The 31st just ended, didn't it?   
Did the anchor misread the date?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Geez, man... Is that all it was?   
Sad - Guess even the news people screw up every once in a while. Really had me going there for a second...   
   
Ken Amada   
Weird... My phone says it's the 31st, too...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - So like... It's gotta be a false alarm, yeah?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That's... a sensible assumption to make for now.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - But something felt... off...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Eh, it's getting late... We should probably call it a night.   
Sad - I know we wanted to say goodbye to the dorm with a bang, but not like this.   
   
Aigis   
Um... Would it be all right if I returned to my room?   
I have preparations to make for the move tomorrow...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh, of course. Good night, Aigis.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Niiiiiight...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'd best contact Yukari and Akihiko... Just in case.

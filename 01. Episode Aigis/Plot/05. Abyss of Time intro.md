Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Oh...   
   
Aigis   
Sad - ......   
   
Koromaru   
Woof! Woof!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Aigis!   
   
Aigis   
Sad - I...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Phew, glad to see you awake!   
Happy - You really scared us, passing out like that.   
   
Aigis   
Yukari-san...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - Mitsuru-senpai asked me to come just in case, and I get caught up in something like this?   
Sad - Come on, seriously?   
   
Aigis   
Happy - I'm sorry for worrying you.   
   
Aigis   
Hm? What's all this?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
While I was fixing your body, I added some additional equipment.   
We found some strange things under the floor...   
There was no sign that you would wake up, so instead of waiting, we tried everything we could.   
   
Aigis   
I see.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - It still sucks though, getting bossed around by her like that.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
That girl told us, "If you want to protect Aigis, you should put that on her."   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hey, sounds like you've had a rough time.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
No worries here, though. She's on her best behavior now.   
   
Metis   
Faceplate down - ......   
   
Ken Amada   
I guess she wasn't lying after all.   
Angry - Anyway, she can't cause any trouble now. We have our Evokers this time.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Man, why do you gotta bust things up like that!? It's my turn to clean the place today!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - How about you quit it with the silent treatment and say something?   
   
Metis   
Faceplate down - Mm... Huh...?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Are you serious? You were sleeping all this time!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Whoa!   
   
Metis   
Surprised - Uh, I-I...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - You were lookin' pretty comfy there... Guess you don't think of us humans as much of a threat, huh?   
   
Metis   
Angry - I-It's just, I was tired after going into Orgia Mode, so...   
   
Metis   
Surprised - ...Ah!   
   
Aigis   
Did you cooperate with them in order to help me?   
   
Metis   
Happy - The reason I came here in the first place was to protect you.   
Happy - You don't need to restrain me. I won't attack anyone anymore.   
   
Aigis   
Angry - Why the sudden change of heart? You can't expect us to trust you without an explanation.   
   
Metis   
Sad - Well, it's...   
   
Metis   
Sad - It's because... I thought you wouldn't like me if I did.   
   
Aigis   
......   
   
Aigis   
Let's release her.   
   
Aigis   
I don't know if she can be trusted, but I believe she has no intention of attacking us any further.   
Besides, if she's really like me, then the restraints won't hold her anyway.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Seriously...? Then all those friggin' nonstop shifts were for nothing...?   
   
Aigis   
First, tell us who you are and your purpose in being here.   
   
Metis   
My name is... Metis. As you can see, you and I are essentially sister units.   
In fact, you are the reason why I'm here.   
Angry - I've come to save you from this hopeless situation.   
   
Aigis   
Hopeless situation?   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Did... something happen while I was asleep?   
Sad - Speaking of which, how long was I asleep?   
   
Metis   
Since our battle ended, I'd say about a day and a half has passed.   
   
Metis   
...Yet today is still March 31st.   
Angry - Tomorrow, and all the days after it, will also be March 31st. At this rate, it will last forever.   
Angry - Didn't you feel it? The moment **time looped**?   
   
Aigis   
Angry - Looped? Do you mean what we felt at midnight?   
Angry - Then... are you saying that the same day is repeating itself!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - That's not all... We haven't been able to leave the dorm either.   
Angry - That makes two ways we're trapped here.   
   
Aigis   
Angry - What!? But how could that—!?   
   
Metis   
Angry - Both space and time are being distorted by the **Abyss of Time** beneath us.   
   
Aigis   
The... Abyss of Time?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's difficult to explain. It'd be easier to show you.   
   
Metis   
I'll lead the way. Please follow me.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - H-Hey! Who made you the boss!?   
   
---   
   
Aigis   
Angry - What...!?   
   
Metis   
This is the Abyss of Time.   
It's uncharted territory that I believe spreads underground, much like the roots of a tree.   
   
Aigis   
Angry - How could something like this have appeared under the lounge?   
   
Metis   
At first, the Abyss of Time was just a small, self-contained space.   
But then one day, it started growing rapidly and eventually spread to your dorm.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's clear just by looking at it that this place wasn't man-made.   
Sad - It might be the product of some dangerous power, just like Tartarus was.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Sheesh... Haven't we had enough of that kinda stuff already?   
   
Metis   
I'm not sure words alone can fully convey what's happening, but the flow of time here is abnormal.   
That's why time is looping—and why you can't leave the dorm.   
The only solution is to find a way to somehow **eradicate the Abyss of Time**.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Eradicate it? How're we supposed to do that?   
   
Metis   
I've already tried the simplest method that has the highest probability of success...   
...Eliminating all of you.   
   
Metis   
The Abyss of Time is linked to this dorm, as if drawn to it.   
And for some reason, you are the only ones who can perceive the time loop.   
Clearly, there is a strong connection between all of you and what's happening.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - So that's why you attacked? To eliminate us...?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - What the hell!? We've never even heard of this place before!   
   
Metis   
If there is another way, it can only be found by entering the Abyss of Time.   
You'll have to discover the cause and strike at its source.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
So you want us to investigate it under the assumption that we'll have to fight?   
   
Metis   
That's why I insisted on the extra equipment to protect Aigis.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Hold on... You're joking, right?   
Surprised - Are you seriously telling us that we have to risk our lives again like we did with Tartarus!?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Never mind that! How are we supposed to just believe whatever you say and jump into that freaky place blind!?   
   
Metis   
Angry - Well, do you have a better plan?   
Angry - The basement of your dorm is an infinite abyss, time is looping, and you can't reach the outside world...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Ah, if we can't leave the dorm, how will we eat!?   
Sad - If we're stuck here long enough, and we run out of food...   
Surprised - Are we going to starve to death!?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Noooooo!   
   
Metis   
Angry - If the current situation continues, things could get worse.   
Angry - This is your only option if you want to survive.   
   
Aigis   
Naturally, we all want to survive.   
But you attacked us the minute you saw us. You must understand that we can't simply entrust our lives to you.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - I'm not even buying your reason for being here.   
Angry - You say you want to protect Aigis, but what's in it for you?   
   
Metis   
[cut 11 4 1]   
   
Metis   
Surprised - What's in it for me? I'm doing this because I care about her!   
Surprised - I mean, she's all I have!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
About that... Your story doesn't fit the facts.   
Aigis was the last of her series—no other units were produced after her.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - And on top of that, it bothers me that you talk like you've been in the Abyss of Time from the start.   
Angry - I thought this was supposed to be uncharted territory that was unconnected to the outside world until recently.   
   
Metis   
Sad - W-Well...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Aren't you supposed to be an anti-Shadow weapon anyway? Attacking us humans to save Aigis doesn't make sense.   
   
Metis   
Sad - That's... I... Um...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Well? We're waiting... Hope you've got a good answer.   
Angry - You better not be thinking you can get away with pullin' a fast one on us again...   
   
Metis   
Angry - E-Enough about me! What good is knowing any of this anyway!?   
Angry - Besides, haven't I already told you that there's no time to waste!?   
   
Metis   
Angry - Now, follow me.   
Angry - Or are you giving up so soon? Because if you are, you should have just let me kill you in the first place!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
[cut 4 2 0]   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - What did you just say!?   
   
Aigis   
You're right. We may have no choice but to enter this place...   
   
Aigis   
Angry - But if you continue to act this way, we'll have to go on without you.   
   
Metis   
[cut 11 4 1]   
   
Metis   
Surprised - Huh...? Without me?   
Happy - Haha... You couldn't possibly...   
Happy - Y-You need me! I know the most about the Abyss. A-And...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - As if! What do you know about what we need?   
   
Aigis   
Angry - We all risk our lives for each other.   
Angry - If you think so little of my friends, then you can't come with us.   
   
Metis   
Surprised - No...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Might suck, but if that's how you're gonna be, then we'll just leave you here by yourself.   
   
Metis   
Surprised - ...!   
   
Metis   
Surprised - By... myself?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Aw, not happy with that? If you'd rather be our enemy, then we can settle things right here.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - W-We don't have to go that far...   
   
Metis   
Looking away - I'm... sorry.   
   
Metis   
Sad - I'm sorry... Please don't be mad at me, Aigis.   
   
Metis   
Sad - I'll listen to you from now on! I will! So please don't leave me...   
   
Aigis   
......   
   
Junpei Iori   
Look, even if you change your tune now, it's not like we're gonna start trusting you...   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Still though, maybe it's true that all she really wants is to protect Aigis-san...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - ...Well, Senpai? Should we take her with us?   
Looking away - ...'Cause if this is our only choice, I just wanna hurry up and get it over with.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Okay, everyone, listen up.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It seems that once again, we must engage in both exploration and battle.   
I've been thinking it over, and I believe Aigis should take command.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If someone with the power to change Personas is in charge, we can proceed the same way as before.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
And if you, as the leader, approve of it... then I have no objections to Metis accompanying us.   
   
Aigis   
Mitsuru-san...   
   
Metis   
Sad - ......   
   
Aigis   
If you want to protect me, you must fight to protect us all.   
Whatever happens, you can't hurt my friends. Can you promise me that?   
   
Metis   
Happy - Yes! I promise!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Looking away - This better not come back to bite us in the ass.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, Aigis.   
Angry - Since Mitsuru-senpai just mentioned it... What's up with you suddenly having his power?   
   
Aigis   
Sad - I... honestly don't know.   
Sad - When I thought we might lose someone else, I got scared, and suddenly...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Metis, was it? Do you know anything about this?   
   
Metis   
Surprised - I just met her. How would I know?   
Anyway, if you already know someone with that same power, why not just ask them?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - ......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If we're going to end up fighting again, we'd better make sure we're outfitted properly.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well, as far as the school records are concerned, you and I are technically still Gekkoukan students.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yamagishi, could I ask you to retrieve the armbands from the command room?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Of course.   
Oh, and as for the things we found when the floor opened up—I put them in the command room, so I'll look into them once I have a chance.   
Maybe I can learn something.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right, let's get back upstairs.   
   
Metis   
Um, Aigis?   
   
Metis   
Sad - I-I promise to listen to what you say, so...   
Sad - Could I... call you my sister?   
   
Metis   
Looking away - ......   
   
Aigis   
Happy - ...Go right ahead.   
   
Metis   
[cut 11 1 1]   
   
Metis   
Happy - Thank you... Sister!   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
The Abyss of Time...   
A strange and mysterious dimension   
that has suddenly appeared out of nowhere.   
Until we find the reason   
for its presence, we'll be   
unable to leave the dorm.   
We must begin looking   
into its depths at once...

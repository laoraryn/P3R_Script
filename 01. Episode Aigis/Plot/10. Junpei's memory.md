Sad - ......   
Sad - That dumbass...   
Angry - Seriously, getting drunk on cooking wine? That's damn pathetic, even for a deadbeat dad.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - But... So am I, I guess, for running out like this every day.   
Sad - Man... What am I gonna do now? I got nowhere to go.   
   
Junpei Iori   
'Sup, pooch? You got nowhere better to be, either?   
   
White Dog   
Arf, arf!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sorry, bud, I don't got any food for ya.   
Y'know, you look kinda familiar... Have I seen you 'round here before?   
   
Former Classmate   
Yo, it's Junpei!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh...? Oh, hey, guys.   
   
Former Classmate   
Aw, why the long face? You sad we're in different homerooms now?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Nah, only thing sad here is your IQ.   
Wait, ain't it way past your dorm's curfew? What're you guys doin' out here?   
   
Former Classmate   
Oh, you know, we snuck out. Once you're a second-year, you learn where the secret exit is.   
Anyway, we're headin' to Escapade to celebrate my guy here finally striking out. Wanna come with?   
   
Lovelorn Friend   
Whatever! I still have a shot!   
   
Former Classmate   
Heh, still in denial, huh? C'mon, face it, man. Yukari Takeba is way out of your league in the first place.   
I never expected her to hook up with that new transfer student right off the bat, though.   
Guess she's into the dark and mysterious type.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I dunno, he seemed like a normal dude to me.   
   
Former Classmate   
Nah, man. Get this—that transfer kid? Rumor has it both his parents died when he was younger.   
Someone got a peek at his file when Toriumi left it lying around.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Man, you're so gullible... That stuff only happens in soap operas.   
   
Former Classmate   
Hey, I did say it was just a rumor.   
Look, man, forget that—let's get going! I know a guy who knows a guy who can grab us some booze.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Booze...? Uh, sorry, I... think I'm gonna pass.   
   
Former Classmate   
What? C'mon! Live a little why don'tcha—

Junpei Iori   
Angry - Dude, I already said no! I just... ain't in the mood.   
   
Former Classmate   
Well, looks like I'm the only one nursing your broken heart tonight.   
   
Lovelorn Friend   
Dude, I'm telling you, I still have a shot!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Heh... Just had to turn 'em down. Today's really not my day.   
   
White Dog   
Sad - *whimper*   
   
Junpei Iori   
Man... Wonder if I'll actually be happy with my life one day.   
Sad - I wish I could like... change the world somehow.   
Sad - If only I could do something that no one else can do... Like, having some kinda special skill or power, you know?   
   
White Dog   
Sad - *whine*   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Haha, aw, don't gimme that.   
Happy - I'm sure someday... Someday we'll be able to make real friends—friends who actually understand us.   
   
White Dog   
Happy - Arf!   
   
---   
   
Junpei Iori   
Looking away - Heheh... Definitely not my proudest moment there.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Junpei...   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oh yeah! That surprised me, too, bud!   
Happy - So it really was you that day, huh!   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Arf!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Kinda seems like destiny, don't it?   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Ruff!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Come to think of it, that was the same day Sanada-san found me.   
I had nowhere to be, so I was just chillin' in the convenience store and readin' magazines when the Dark Hour hit.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - You were pretty much a sitting duck, about to burst into tears. Man, your face was more terrifying than any Shadow.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - W-Well, what was I supposed to do!? That was the scariest damn moment of my life, man!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Hehe.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - My life back then, what with my old man and all, was... I dunno, not boring, but... Well, you saw what it was like.   
Happy - So staying at the dorm, fighting Shadows and everything... It's been unreal.   
   
Metis   
Surprised - Interesting...   
Surprised - Unlike my sister and me, other people usually have a reason to awaken...   
Surprised - I comprehend.   
   
Aigis   
I had a reason as well.   
However, in my case, it happened in reverse. I possessed the power first, then discovered my true feelings later.   
Speaking of which, do you—   
   
   
Metis   
Hmm... I think I'm starting to get it.   
   
Metis   
The doors only show us memories of great significance.   
Once they've served their purpose, they disappear. Those that remain have yet to fulfill their roles.   
   
Aigis   
"Their purpose"...? What purpose?   
   
Metis   
I'm not entirely sure... But if we keep exploring, I think we'll be able to find out.   
   
Metis   
[cut 11 1 1]   
   
Metis   
Happy - So let's keep going—together. Okay?   
   
Aigis   
Happy - O-Okay... Let's.   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
Discovering my own reason came   
so naturally that I never thought   
much of it until then...   
She's so full of emotion,   
nothing like me when I reactivated.   
...Even though she's never had   
any contact with other people.   
Does she have a memory of her own   
where she discovers her reason?   
The seed of curiosity was planted,   
and I started to wonder...

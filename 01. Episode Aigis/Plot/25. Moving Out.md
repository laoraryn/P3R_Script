Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - Let's see... My large items have been shipped... Am I forgetting anything...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I just got word. Our transportation will be here shortly.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You're taking everyone else too?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yes, their new dorms are on the way to the lab anyway.   
Happy - And since we're all here, I thought we might as well travel together. It would be dull otherwise.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Has anyone seen Junpei? I told him not to be late...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Horrified - Waaaaaaahhh!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Junpei-kun!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I bet he's trying to carry everything at once. Just ignore him.   
He did the same thing last year.   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - I see... That sounded like it really hurt, though...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Owww, my face... No one saw that, right?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Are you all right? Can't leave him alone for five minutes...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sounds like they're here.   
Let's get going, shall we?   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Um...!   
   
Aigis   
Sad - I... actually have a favor to ask...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What is it?   
   
Aigis   
Sad - I, uh... I know it's last-minute and might be too late, but...   
Sad - Would it be okay for me to... not go back to the lab?   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Before... I thought I'd lost my purpose. My reason to live...   
Sad - But now I realize that isn't the case.   
Sad - If possible... I would like to keep attending school with Yukari-san and everyone.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Aigis...   
   
Aigis   
I want to continue experiencing new things with you all!   
If it's not too late...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ......   
Sad - Well... It would be difficult, since I'm no longer involved with Gekkoukan High...   
   
Driver   
Your transportation has arrived, ma'am.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Thank you.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Senpai!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I apologize, but there's been a sudden change in plans. We'll now be going to the school's Tatsumi Hall.   
Happy - The transfer to the lab has been canceled.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Senpai... You mean...!?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Very happy* - Hell yeah! That's what I'm talkin' about!   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Thank you so much!   
   
Aigis   
Happy - It's an honor to be able to stay with you all!

Yukari Takeba   
It's... weirdly kinda sad to leave, huh?   
   
Aigis   
Yes. But...   
Change is part of life.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, so... If you're gonna   
live in the dorms next year...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Do you... wanna be roommates?   
   
Aigis   
Huh...?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I imagine you still need one.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
And also, it just makes sense, y'know?   
Because we're friends. Aren't we?   
   
Aigis   
Yeah... Let's do it!

Aigis   
This ordeal... It may be that   
we brought it upon ourselves.   
   
Aigis   
The fact that a future exists is not   
a guarantee that all will have access to it.   
   
Aigis   
It's something so obvious...   
And yet, we did not understand it.   
   
Aigis   
There was little we did understand.   
   
Aigis   
We didn't know how to use   
the key to unlock our future.

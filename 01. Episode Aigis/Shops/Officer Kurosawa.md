All Valuables in your possession will be sold.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
All done here?   
   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
Hm? You finished?   
   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
Come back when you need to.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
See ya.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
If you want to buy anything, you know where to find me. Drop by anytime.   
   
Aigis - Selection   
Keep shopping   
Exit   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
That get-up... So you're with the Kirijo too, huh?   
I assume you've been filled in? I don't have much here, but take a look.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
I don't have that much, but you should be able to find what you need.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
Running a little sale today. See if anything catches your eye.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
Those Apathy Syndrome cases in pairs came to an abrupt halt.   
I thought it was because of you guys, but if that were the case, wouldn't you look a bit happier?   
Eh, I know you've got a lot going on. What can I get for you today?   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
Apathy Syndrome may be on the decline, but people are still on edge.   
The rumors won't end, and the media's not helping. Just don't worry yourselves with all that.   
All right, go ahead and pick something. You need this stuff, right?   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
Y'know your buddy, the kid with the hat? He seemed real down about something...   
But then all of a sudden, he was bouncing off the walls. Was that what it was like to be young? It was so long ago...   
Sorry, got distracted for a second there. What'll it be today?   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
I heard about the incident. What a terrible thing to happen...   
You guys are putting your lives on the line, and I can only gripe about my ineptitude...   
At the very least, I want to do what I can to help you out.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
Seeing as you're here, I take it things aren't over yet.   
I can tell by the look on your face. You've still got a ways to go, huh?   
Well, I've got a job to do, and I plan on doing it. Here, have a good look.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
You look... completely lost right now. I won't pry into what's on your mind, but... Hmm...   
Trust your instincts. Because in the end... That's all you can really count on.   
...I sound like a fortune cookie. In any case, what can I interest you in today?   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
This isn't any of my business, but... Have you been having some disagreements lately?   
They say no matter how close you are to someone, you can't avoid butting heads now and then.   
But sometimes, that's exactly what you need to do. And if there's anyone who can get through this, it's you guys.   
Sorry, didn't mean to talk your ear off. Now, what'll it be?   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
...That's a promising look in your eyes. I take it you've almost wrapped things up?   
No matter what you're up against, I have faith you can pull this off.   
Make sure you're fully prepared. You don't want to end up with any regrets.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
Apathy Syndrome may be on the decline, but people are still on edge.   
I mean, who can blame them? Rumors spread, and the media fans the flames.   
Anyway... Pick what you like.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
Apathy Syndrome may be a serious issue, but the people panicking over it are also a handful.   
The world is always like that. Powerlessness is a knave.   
Well... Take your time and look around.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
There's been another spike in Apathy Syndrome cases. The entire city is in a panic.   
It's times like these when the police need to step up, but the reality is we've got no recourse.   
In any case... take your time and browse.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
You know your buddy, the kid with the hat? Iori, was it?   
He seemed real down about something. Did something happen?   
Well, anyway... What'll you take today?   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
There's been a lotta talk about Apathy Syndrome both online and in the news lately.   
The rumors have gotten out of hand. Some say it's contagious, others insist it's a foreign conspiracy...   
Well, I'm just going to do what I can.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
I heard about the incident. What a terrible thing to happen...   
You guys are putting your lives on the line, and I can only gripe about my ineptitude...   
At the very least, I want to do what I can to help you out.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
I hear this is gonna be the last stand.   
Well, then... prepare yourself as much as possible.   
Don't die out there...   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
Seeing as you're here, I take it things aren't over yet.   
With the Kirijo Group in the state they're in, there's no telling how things will turn out.   
All I can do right now is fulfill my duties.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
I won't pry for details, but I know something happened to you guys.   
Don't dwell on it for too long. No one blames you.   
This is all I can do for you, but I don't want you pushing yourselves too hard.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
The look on your face tells me you're ready to finish off one last big job.   
No matter what you're up against, I have faith you can pull this off.   
Spare no preparation and make sure you come back alive.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
You'd best be equipped for all contingencies. It's anyone's guess what could happen.   
If there's anything you don't need, I can take it off your hands.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
There's still more...   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
The missing person's family sent a thank-you letter.   
Take this, too.   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
That reminds me, didn't that supposed Santa   
tell me to do something good for the world?   
Maybe I should show him this letter...   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
Oh, right. This is for you.   
It's nothing special, but you might still get some use out of it.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
That reminds me—I wanted you to have this.   
It's just a little something for all the hard work you've been putting in.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
Oh, that's right. I have something for you.   
We've been working together for some time. Think of it as a bonus.

# P3R_Script

---

## Overview 

I wanted to have the script for the game in one place for Angst and Fanfic reasons, and since I couldn't find it anywhere, I did it myself!

It's all a WIP, and the parts that have been organized are organized by what makes sense to my own brain :)

It goes without saying that there are spoilers for the entire content of the game!

## Structure

Both main folders are separated into sub-folders roughly based on where the text shows up. There's:
1. Combat 
	- Anything that turns up while you're in Tartarus or a Full Moon operation
	- Ditto, but for The Abyss of Time
2. Friends 
	- Social links, linked episodes, other major characters. Also includes all the random unnamed NPCs around town, separated by where they're found
		- Party members' dorm hangouts, evening chatter are all in here
		- All characters' interactions on March 4 are in their folders and labeled as such
	- Party members, Elizabeth interactions
		- Dorm hangouts in between AOT segments, and Theurgy reawakenings are also in here
3. Plot 
	- Self-explanatory. Numbered in chronological order
4. School 
	- The Journey only (obv). Includes all morning gossip, class lectures/questions/exams, and the dorm study parties before each exam
5. Shops
	- Flavor text/conversations for all the shops in both segments of the game
6. UI
	- Basically everything else... anything that isn't a conversation you have with someone. Item descriptions, ingame dictionaries, tutorials. Some evening dorm chatter is in here too. Persona descriptions and greetings, computer software...

## To dos:
- [ ] [[Misc Tartarus stuff]] and [[Navi text]] need to be cleaned up  
- [ ] In both Plot and Friends folders, delineating different dialogue depending on your conversation options would be awesome, but a big project...
- [ ] [[After school and evening]] is a mess   
- [ ] Journey > UI > Overworld flavor text is an absolute mess. "General objects" folder hasn't been touched at all
- [ ] Evening chatter docs for party members could get cleaned up... if I get very ambitious
- [ ] Fairly certain there's some raw tag data still in The Answer folder - I started with cleaning up The Journey first. That'll be a couple of find/replace adventures
- [ ] No promises that Combat, Shops, and UI in The Answer are Answer exclusive. I pulled everything in that top-level folder from the Astrea directory in the game files, which THEORETICALLY was full of the files for Episode Aigis, but it seems like there was some overlap because some of the files seem Journey specific. (For example, I deleted several files that had Navi!Mitsuru lines)
	- However, the Plot and Friends folders for The Answer should be accurate.
- [ ] The Combat > Navis folders are still kind of a mess...
- [ ] I'd like to put dates on The Journey's Plot folder stuff just for my own sanity. 
- [ ] Maybe also put months on the guys' linked episodes ??
- [ ] Make consistent the "bringing teammates to BBV" setup

## Expansion...someday:
- [ ] Once I get the 2D assets organized and cleaned up I'd like to have them in here too!
	- [ ] Maybe even with cross-references to the script files - ie, embed visuals for all Minato's Personas in the Persona descriptions and greetings file
	- [ ] Made less necessary by <a href="https://p3rsprites.neocities.org/">this amazing bustup generator</a> made by <a href="https://x.com/MakotoYuki43161/status/2006369098985595161">MakotoYuki43161</a>, but cut-ins, renders, etc would still be cool
- [ ] The 3D models would also be amazing but I think those might be too big?
- [ ] Maybe put a link to Youtube videos for social links and plot events at the top of the file - so both options are in one place

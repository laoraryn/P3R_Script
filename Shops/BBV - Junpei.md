Surprised - What a wacky store, huh? Somethin' about, "Cleanse your soul and face your inner self"?

Junpei Iori
Not sure what that's all about, but... Maybe this place could do some good for us.

Junpei Iori
Happy - ...I'll give it a shot, I guess. Wonder what my "inner self" is like.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Oh, this place again. You know they say they'll help you "cleanse your soul and face your inner self" or whatever? Weird, right?

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - Actually, he took me here before. Didn't take long for me to conk out and snooze through the whole thing.

Junpei Iori
Happy - But this time'll be different!

Junpei Iori
Happy - This place again? Hehe, you really like comin' here, don't you, Ai-chan?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Well, y'know... I don't mind it that much either. Anyway, here goes.

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - Man, I slept like a log! I seriously don't remember anything...

Junpei Iori
Happy - To be honest with ya... I feel like a weight's been lifted off my shoulders, so much so I might even burst into tears—


Junpei Iori
Surprised - I mean, uh... Who said that? Not me! Just forget you heard anything!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Well, anyway, thanks for the invite!

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - ...I can't believe it. I just slept through the whole thing again. What even happened after we went in? I'm drawing a blank.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Haha, the exact same thing happened when I went with him. Heck, I feel just as relaxed as I did then.

Junpei Iori
Happy - I'm glad I got the chance to come here again. Thanks for inviting me, Aigis.

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - Man... I was completely out cold the whole time. I can't remember a single thing that went down in there—again.

Junpei Iori
Happy - But, I hafta admit, I dunno what they did in there, but I feel good. Real good.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Thanks for the invite. Now I'm ready to rock 'n' roll!

Aigis - Thoughts
It's almost nighttime... I should
head back to the dorm.

It's getting late... I should

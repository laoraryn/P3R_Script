Hm? This is the place?

Akihiko Sanada
"The services we provide here will allow you to face your inner self"... Interesting.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Wonder what that means for us. Should we go check it out, Aigis?

Akihiko Sanada
I've been here before, actually. He invited me here, and—


Akihiko Sanada
Sad - Sorry, never mind.

Akihiko Sanada
They say you can face your inner self here, do they? Well then, why don't we take them up on their challenge?

Akihiko Sanada
Oh, we're back here? Going to face our inner selves again, are we?

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - I may have slipped up last time, but this time for sure I'll keep my eyes peeled.

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - ...I was knocked out cold in a matter of seconds.

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - How am I supposed to know if I actually faced off with my inner self or not?

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - But... My head does feel clearer now, so I guess I'll just drop it. Well, see you around, Aigis.

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - ...I was knocked out cold in a matter of seconds.

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - I can't believe this. The same thing happened last time. Have I actually been able to face my inner self at all?

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - But... My head does feel clearer now, so I'll just drop it. Well, see you around, Aigis.

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - Not again... I can't believe I was out cold for everything this time, too.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Honestly, though, I'm feeling in tip top form after coming here. Thanks for inviting me out, Aigis.

Aigis - Thoughts
It's almost nighttime... I should
head back to the dorm.

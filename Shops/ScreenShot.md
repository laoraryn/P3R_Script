Patriarch
Tch, you think some two-bit merc like you has what it takes to kill me!?

Patriarch
Son, you're the one who'll take over the family, so save yourself. Get the hell out of here!

Son-in-Law
I won't become your successor... but no way am I leaving you behind! You're my father-in-law!

Troubled Boy
I can't... I can't look... The top of the tower... It's terrifying!

Counselor
You'll be all right. That point can't hurt you. Go on, take a look. It's not even that sharp.

Counselor
Open your eyes. It's Paris, the most beautiful city in the world. Face forward, turn away from your past...

American Girl
All right, Taro. Ready for the first session of your private English lessons? Repeat after me!

Korean Girl
Nancy, could you stop hogging him? Taro is going out to eat dak hanmari with me!

French Girl
Hold on now, So-yeon. Taro and I have a date at the museum today. He must witness the beauty of French art himself!

Human Anatomy Model Ghost
Look behind you, children... Fear me! Scream and cower before me!

Girl
Eek! The anatomical model from the science lab is moving!

Boy
That's scientifically impossible. It's just a lame prank. I'm not gonna turn around and look like an idiot.

TV Announcer
...While the newly excavated box itself dates back to the Heian era, the letter inside appears to be written in modern Japanese...

High Schooler
Th-That's it! That's my letter! It really did travel back in time...

High Schooler
That means... you really did get my message—that I love you, Murasaki Shikibu.

Junior Investigator
This must be the method the culprit used to seemingly vanish into thin air.

Senior Investigator
I see. The statute of limitations ran out three years ago, but with modern technology, we may be able to shed some light on this case.

Junior Investigator
Perhaps... But it's just as likely we may never discover the truth—like the past 127 cases.

Movie Protagonist
Just crossing the street is going to take twenty minutes at my current size!

Movie Protagonist
And it's way too dangerous, what with all these kids running around and the dogs out for walks!

Movie Protagonist
But I'm not giving up! Nothing's gonna stand in my way! Just you wait, 3rd Street!

Voice Over the Radio
Agent G, this is a covert operation. Wouldn't your cover be blown by your attire?

Agent G
Do you think me incompetent? My outfit hardly matters when the enemy won't notice a thing.

Agent G
Right then. The next time I'll be in contact, it's to report a mission well done. Now, allons-y!

Detective Pompadour
That testimony is bullshit, man! YOU'RE the real perp!

Culprit
Ugh... My plan was perfect. I just didn't account for you showing up on your motorcycle.

Detective Pompadour
Heh! I swear on my sick-ass hair that I'll solve any case—and don't you forget it!

Happy - You're curious about this place, too? I know the feeling.

Ken Amada
Happy - This place caught my interest ever since I heard you can face your inner self here.

Ken Amada
Happy - I know it looks kind of seedy at first glance, but they do say not to judge a book by its cover.

Ken Amada
Sad - I remember this place... He brought me here before. That feels like such a long time ago now.

Ken Amada
Surprised - Oh, sorry! I got a little distracted there.

Ken Amada
Happy - This place allegedly lets you face your inner self. I've been wanting to give that another shot. Come on, let's head in.

Ken Amada
Happy - This place is strangely compelling. Every time we wrap up, I always immediately want to come back.

Ken Amada
Happy - This time for sure, I won't fall asleep... All right, here goes!

Ken Amada
Sad - One minute, I was looking at a healing stone... The next, I was fast asleep.

Ken Amada
Happy - But my head feels so much clearer now, and not just because of the nap.

Ken Amada
Happy - It's kind of hard to describe. But it doesn't feel bad at all.

Ken Amada
Happy - I don't know if I actually did get to face my inner self, but thank you for inviting me here anyway.

Ken Amada
Sad - One minute I was looking at a healing stone, and the next I was fast asleep...

Ken Amada
Happy - But my head feels so much clearer now, and not just because of the nap.

Ken Amada
Happy - I felt the same way when I came here with him, too. Kind of strange, isn't it?

Ken Amada
Happy - Anyway... Thank you for inviting me here, Aigis-san.

Ken Amada
Sad - I didn't even feel myself fall asleep again... I wonder if there's some kind of secret to that stone.

Ken Amada
Happy - Not only that, but my head feels so clear. This place is just so mysterious...

Ken Amada
Happy - Maybe we should come back sometime. It'd be a nice change of pace every now and then.

Aigis - Thoughts
It's almost nighttime... I should
head back to the dorm.

It's getting late... I should

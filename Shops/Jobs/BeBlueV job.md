Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I detailed various products
to a number of patrons...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I crammed information about charmstones
in order to improve my sales pitch...!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I was taught about the products and
their connections to various practices...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I worked hard to serve customers in a store
dedicated to relaxation and healing...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I worked hard, surrounded by crystals
that were glowing mysteriously...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Tired customers left the store
looking completely rejuvenated...!

Manager
All right, I'm going to increase your hourly wage! People need to be rewarded for their hard work.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Since I'm getting the hang of things,
they're giving me a slight raise...!

Manager
Hey, a customer complimented you earlier. You should work here full-time after you graduate!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Since I've gotten better at my work,
they're giving me a slight raise...!

Manager

and  increased...!

===============================================================================================

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Customers asked lots of questions... But I
explained everything politely and clearly...!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I worked hard to satisfy each
customer on a frantically busy day...!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
A customer was pleased when I suggested
a healing stone that suited them...!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The spell dolls sold like hotcakes... I attended
to customers while restocking products...!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It was a stressful day, but the soothing effect
of the store helped me get through it...!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The healing music playing in the
store helped me stay relaxed...

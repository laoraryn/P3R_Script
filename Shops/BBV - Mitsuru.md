Mitsuru Kirijo
This the place...?

Mitsuru Kirijo
"Cleanse your soul. Face your inner self." That's quite the slogan...

Mitsuru Kirijo
But, for some reason, it feels as if these words carry more meaning for us. Since we're already here, shall we look into it?

Mitsuru Kirijo
"Cleanse your soul. Face your inner self." This place looks no different from how I remember it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Did you want to go in, Aigis? If so, I'd be happy to join you. It's been some time since I last visited, after all.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Oh? You want to pay this place another visit?

Mitsuru Kirijo
I suppose it wouldn't hurt for us to "face our inner selves" right now.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Well then, I'll be back soon.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - I can't believe I fell asleep... That hardly ever happens—in public, I mean—if at all.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Unfortunately, I missed most of the experience, but... I feel refreshed, somehow.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Thank you for inviting me, Aigis.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Ha... I fell asleep almost immediately. I suppose some things never change.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Thank you for inviting me, Aigis. I appreciate it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'm not certain if I truly did face my inner self, but... I do feel as if a fog has lifted.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - It seems I fell asleep again... That's rather surprising, given the circumstances.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Still, everything seems so much clearer now. I suppose that means it was worth the trip.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Thank you for inviting me here, Aigis.

Aigis - Thoughts
It's almost nighttime... I should
head back to the dorm.

Aigis - Thoughts
It's getting late... I should
head back to the dorm.

Hi there! Welcome!
Oh, oops! Sorry, habit. We're still setting up shop today.
We'll have a wide selection of products ready, so come back another time if you want to buy something.

Maybe I should ask about the rumors
of the **taiyaki** I read on the website...

School Store Vendor
Oh, taiyaki? It's our long-awaited new product that's getting rave reviews!
I got so many requests from students that I started bringing them in every day.
And you know what, it's a big hit... Sorry, I'm starting to ramble.
Anyway, this taiyaki is **delicious even if you chill it in the fridge at home**... So try it out!

**Lukewarm Taiyaki** can now be bought at the school store.

School Store Vendor
Oh, sorry, I'm talking too much, aren't I? So, what would you like to buy?

School Store Vendor
Hm? You seem interested in what we've got for sale... You must be new or a transfer student!
We don't have a huge variety of bread, but they're all very popular.
I prepare a lot of food for the kids who are doing club activities.

School Store Vendor
I heard that the captain of the boxing team got injured.
Some girls were gossiping about it. That's a rough way to start the new school year.

School Store Vendor
Did you hear that one of the students fainted? Is she all right?
Hmmm... There's a lot of weird stuff going on out there. You should watch out too.

School Store Vendor
I guess the heat doesn't bother you guys when you're wearing your summer clothes.
As for me... There's no air conditioner in here, and it gets so hot!

School Store Vendor
It's almost summer vacation.
The shop will be closed for the duration, so...
That means I won't get paid. *sigh* This month is going to be tight...

School Store Vendor
I see that Apathy Syndrome stuff on the news a lot these days. It seems like there's more of them.
How worrying... You should be careful about that.
If it spreads too wide and the school shuts down, I'd have to look for another job...

School Store Vendor
The culture festival got canceled... Well, with how bad that typhoon was, I'm not surprised.
My house got soaked in that typhoon... It was a huge hassle!

School Store Vendor
It's sad when any student dies, no matter what they were like.
I feel like I lost one of my own children...

School Store Vendor
It's cooling down outside lately.
There's no heater here, so it gets freezing cold in the winter.

School Store Vendor
Pick anything you like.

School Store Vendor
Pick anything you like.

School Store Vendor
Pick anything you like.

School Store Vendor
Are you here to buy some taiyaki, too?
Sorry, but we're all sold out on those.
I stock up on them every now and then...
Seems like they've **been trending on some website**, and that's why they sell out so quickly.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
There's no taiyaki on sale...
I should try to gather more information
on the **website** it's trending on...

School Store Vendor
I don't have any taiyaki, but go ahead and look at what else there is.

School Store Vendor
Thanks.

School Store Vendor
Sorry, but we're sold out of everything. Come by again.

Hi there! Welcome!
You're practically a regular here, aren't you? What will you have today?
...Hey, are you all right? You're pale as a sheet...
Tomorrow's the graduation ceremony. Maybe you should go home and get some rest.

Hi there! Welcome!
Hey, are you sick? You're pale as a sheet...
Tomorrow's the graduation ceremony. Maybe you should go home and get some rest.

School Store Vendor - MSG_002_0_0
Go home and rest. You don't want to still be sick for the graduation ceremony tomorrow.

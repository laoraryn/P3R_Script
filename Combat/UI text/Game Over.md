Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Death is not a hunter unbeknownst to its prey.
One is always aware that it lies in wait.
Though life is merely a journey to the grave,
it must not be undertaken without hope.
Only then will a traveler's story live on,
treasured by those who bid him farewell.
Alas, my guest's life has now ended,
his tale left unwritten...

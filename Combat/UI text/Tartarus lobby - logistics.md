Mitsuru Kirijo
Stop right there!
You do know why I called you here today, correct? I'm not letting you leave just yet.

------

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hold it.
We need you to lead the team. Get ready to head in and explore.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
There's no turning back now...

------

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The Dark Hour will soon be over.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Returning to the dorm now means that
time will advance to the next day.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should we stop exploring for tonight?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
We agreed to stop exploring
and return to the dorm.

------

Junpei Iori
Sad - Hey now, where are you goin'? That's the wrong way, dude.

SYS_NOT_FINISH_INSTALL
To proceed, the installation must be complete.

SYS_INSTALL_CANCEL
You will now return to the game. Please wait until your game data is ready. Do not forget to save your game if you want to stop playing.

------

Mitsuru Kirijo
Are you all ready?
Sad - I personally recommend bringing a full party whenever possible.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Are you all ready?

Mitsuru Kirijo
You've currently explored up to floor . Where do you want to resume the expedition?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Good luck.

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right.
As long as you follow my instructions, I'll be able to point you down a safe route.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Floor , you said? Understood. The teleporter should take you there right away.
Stay safe out there.

------

Fuuka Yamagishi
Are you ready to start exploring?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Are you ready to start exploring?
Sad - Oh, um... Are you sure you don't want to bring a full party? Will you be okay?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Looks like you've made it to floor . Where would you like to jump to now?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please be careful.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Got it.
I'll find a safe route for you to traverse, so just follow my directions.

Fuuka Yamagishi
You want to go to floor ? Okay, if you take the teleporter, you'll be there before you know it!
Have a safe trip!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Are you ready?

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'll try to guide you to a more stable floor.
I'll also support you from here, so please keep an ear out while you explore.

------

Mitsuru Kirijo
Wait. Let's stop here for tonight.
We have a long road ahead of us. Let's not push ourselves too hard today.

------

Mitsuru Kirijo
Let's discuss our first goal for this exploration.
According to our research, Tartarus is divided into several different regions.
If we continue to climb the tower, then we'll eventually reach a spot that leads to a new area.
Reaching that spot should be our first goal.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Remember, don't push yourself too hard. You can always use the teleporters to return.
You can always go back to the highest floor you've reached that day.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...Ah, yes. Here, take this.
If you ever find yourselves in danger, don't hesitate to use them.

Mitsuru Kirijo
That's all from my end. Good luck.

------

SYS_ADVICE_APRIL_00
If you return to the entrance mid-exploration, you can resume from the highest floor you've reached that day with Mitsuru's help. Plan wisely to explore more efficiently.
Because Tartarus changes daily, you can only travel to the highest floor on the same day. If you come on another day, you'll have to travel through the floors you've already visited again.

Mitsuru Kirijo
There's something I need to tell you.
Do you remember what I said? About Tartarus being divided into different areas?
I sense a strange presence beyond the 20th floor... I believe that's where a new area begins.
It feels as if something is on the move...
Let's investigate. I want to confirm what's there.
I'm counting on you.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Leader, there's something you need to know.
Tartarus seems to be split up into several different areas.
I'm sensing an anomaly on one of those floors that acts as the border between two areas.
It seems kind of erratic, like it's about to move or something...
From what I can pick up, it seems to be around the 22nd floor. Do you mind checking it out?
Stay safe, and good luck.

------

Yukari Takeba
Everything okay? We're all ready to head out.
Happy - Um... Is there something over there?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It doesn't seem like Yukari
and the others can see it...

------

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
What a large clock... It doesn't
seem to be working though.

SYS_ACCESS_CLOCK_FIRST
The clocks in Tartarus can **fully restore HP and SP** for all party members. **7** Twilight Fragmentss are required to activate the clock once. Use the clock to make exploring more efficient.

MSG_ACCESS_CLOCK_FIRST
Using the clock in Tartarus will fully restore everyone's HP and SP.
Although utilizing the clock will cost s, it should help with exploring when used effectively.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The clock's not ticking... Maybe the hands
will start moving if I use something.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The clock is reacting to the
Twilight Fragments...

SYS_Clock_Error
**Twilight Fragment**s are required to activate the clock.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
How many Twilight Fragments do
I have...? Only ****? That's not enough...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I have **** s on me.
Should I use **Twilight Fragments** to activate the clock?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I used **** Twilight Fragments.  remain.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The clock started ticking...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Everyone's HP and SP has been restored!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Nobody needs any healing right now...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I use **** Twilight Fragmentss
to heal everyone? I have .

-------

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
There's a silver door...
Is this the door Elizabeth was talking about?
I think she said her older sister would
be there... Let's try heading inside.

------

Mitsuru Kirijo
That's where I keep my navigation equipment.
Sorry, but do you mind not touching that?

Mitsuru Kirijo
What's the matter? Are you done for the day?

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right. Rest up and come prepared for our next expedition.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I see. Well, it's your call when to wrap up.

------

Fuuka Yamagishi
Do you want to stop for tonight?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - All right. Please get a good night's rest, everyone.

Fuuka Yamagishi
The decision to leave is yours, of course, but please don't push yourself too hard.

------

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Excellent work. I have high hopes for our future expeditions.
The Dark Hour will be ending soon.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Let's finish up here. Does that sound good to you?

------

Mitsuru Kirijo
Thanks to Yamagishi, I can explore with you, too. But I'd still like to stick to the four-person strategy.
Just so we have backup or anyone who can come to our aid in the event of an emergency.
Happy - And don't forget what happened during the last full moon. We can't leave Yamagishi alone.
I'll leave it up to you to decide on the party members. I know you can handle it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - I'll do everything I can to help. Let's give it our best!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's the same clock as the one
at the entrance... I wonder if
it functions the same way.

-------

Minato Arisato - Selection
Head back
Don't head back

Minato Arisato - Selection
Head back
Continue exploring

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Should I return to the entrance?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Are you ready to return to the entrance?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Roger that.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Would you like to come back to the entrance?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Okay. I'll be waiting for you.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sorry to cut your exploration short, but please come back for now.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Got it.
In a bit.

-----

Minato Arisato - Selection
Keep going
Don't right now

Mitsuru Kirijo
Some members are in battle. Do you want to proceed without them?

Mitsuru Kirijo
...I see. Then continue on and we'll rendezvous with them later.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Some of our team members are still fighting. Will you continue without them?

Fuuka Yamagishi
...All right, understood. Well then, let's keep going!
We'll meet up with anyone staying behind later.

Mitsuru Kirijo
There seems to be a person on this floor. Are you going to leave without them?

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right, let's go.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Someone is still on this floor! Are you sure you're going to move on?

Fuuka Yamagishi
...Okay, we'll keep going.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Wait. There could be more troublesome foes waiting ahead.
Go ahead with the others. You should keep at least one other person with you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - Something feels different about the floor up ahead!
I sense something more potent... like a tangible force of will. Stay alert.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - The floor ahead feels different from the others!
Whatever's there is more powerful than anything before. Be careful.

Mitsuru Kirijo - DESC_FLOOR21_NG_MITU
Hold on a moment... All right, the path ahead is safe.
...And I'm curious what's on the next floor. Please continue forward.

Fuuka Yamagishi - DESC_FLOOR21_NG_FUKA
Please wait just a second... Okay, it seems safe past here.
I'd like to know what's on the next floor. Would it be okay with you to keep going?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Resume from F
Use the teleporter
Don't use

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yeah.
Hold on.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Use the teleporter
Don't use

Mitsuru Kirijo
You've currently explored up to floor . Where do you want to resume the expedition?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Looks like you've made it to floor . Where would you like to jump to now?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Are you ready?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I'll try to guide you to a more stable floor.
Happy - I can't go with you, but I'll do my best to back you up from here!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Understood.
As long as you follow my instructions, I'll be able to point you down a safe route.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Floor , you said? Understood. The teleporter should take you there right away.
Stay safe out there.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Okay, got it.
I'll find a safe route for you to traverse, so just follow my directions.

Fuuka Yamagishi
You want to go to floor ? Okay, if you take the teleporter, you'll be there before you know it!
Have a safe trip!

Mitsuru Kirijo
There's something I need to tell you.
Do you remember what I said? About Tartarus being divided into different areas?
Well, through Penthesilea's power, I picked up on an unusual signal just past the 20th floor...
Something may have shifted, so I'd like you to head there and check it out immediately.
We're counting on you.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Leader, do you have a moment?
Do you remember how Kirijo-senpai said Tartarus is divided into different areas?
Well, one of those areas should end on the 22nd floor, but I'm getting a funny signal from there.
It seems unstable, like it's about to move or something...
So, for today's exploration, I'd recommend investigating the 22nd floor.
Stay safe, and good luck.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The console is displaying
a series of numbers...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hmm, I see...
Go ahead and select the 1st floor on that device. That should bring you back.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, how interesting!
Could you pick the 1st floor on that? I think that should bring you back here.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
What is this? I've never seen
something like it before...
Regardless, it doesn't seem to
be functioning right now.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Apparently, using a one-way teleporter
in Tartarus brings me back here.
It doesn't seem like I can use one to
return to the floor I came from, though.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Thanks to Yamagishi, I can explore with you too. But I'd still like to stick to the four-person strategy.
Just so we have backup or anyone who can come to our aid in the event of an emergency.
And don't forget what happened during the last full moon. We can't leave Yamagishi alone.
Happy - I'll leave it up to you to decide on the party members. I know you can handle it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - I'll do everything I can to help. Let's give it our best!

Mitsuru Kirijo - DESC_FLOOR21_NG_MITU
Hold on a moment... All right, the path ahead is safe.
...And I'm curious what's on the next floor. Please continue forward.

Fuuka Yamagishi - DESC_FLOOR21_NG_FUKA
Please wait just a second... Okay, it seems safe past here.
I'd like to know what's on the next floor. Would it be okay with you to keep going?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Are you all ready?
Sad - I personally recommend bringing a full party whenever possible.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Are you ready to start exploring?
Sad - Oh, um... Are you sure you don't want to bring a full party? Will you be okay?

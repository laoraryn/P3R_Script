We're in luck! That's not an enemy you see often!


That's a rare one! Don't let it escape!


This is bad... You have to get out of there!


You don't stand a chance... Fall back!


This looks dangerous... Stay on alert!


It's not impossible, but... don't let your guard down!


Enemy reinforcements!


You're not out of this yet!


You've got more incoming!


This is beyond the level of an ordinary Shadow. Watch yourselves!


This could be a tough fight. Don't let your guard down!

That's it, Akihiko! Just keep that going!


Brilliant, you're back in the fight!

I can't let you retreat. You'll have to get through this!


Hold on. I'm trying to secure an escape route!


All right, fall back!


I'm sorry. Your escape route was cut off.


There, you can go for a weakness!


You should be able to hit a weak spot!


Here's your chance! You can target a weakness!


It doesn't look like you can strike any weaknesses...


You can't go for any weak points...


Ngh... I don't think you can hit any weak spots...


One of your teammates can hit a weakness! Shift to switch attackers!


There's someone else who can target a weakness. Shifting might help.


You can go for a weak spot if you Shift to swap out.


You have an attack that works well.


You have a skill that's effective here.


Looks like you can deal good damage.


You can hit the enemy's weakness with your weapon!


The enemy's weak to your standard attack!


The enemy seems weak to physical attacks.


A weapon attack would be effective!


Using your weapon could be an effective approach.


Weapon attacks would work well here!


You could go for effective damage, but it might behoove you to scout for more weaknesses.


You have a good option right now, but the enemy may have other weaknesses.


We don't know the enemy's weakness... You'll just have to see what works.


If only we knew the enemy's weaknesses... See if you can find them.


You have an item that can hit their weakness. This is the perfect time!


If you use an item, you can target the enemy's weakness...


You're carrying something that can hit a weakness.


All right, you won. Great work out there.


Well done! Let's continue exploring.


You won! Now let's move on.


The enemy's fled. You almost had it...


All right, time to Shift!


All right, swap out!


Again! Keep going!


Now, on to the next!


This is the third! Great coordination!


That's a full Shift! Excellent teamwork!


They've already taken their action.


That teammate isn't ready right now.


This opponent looks tough... Be on your guard.


This may be a good test of your skill.


This one isn't much of a threat, but don't get careless.


The enemy is weak to slashes!


The enemy is weak to strikes!


You can hit the enemy's weakness with a pierce!


The enemy's weakness is Fire!


Looks like the enemy's weak to Ice!


Go for the enemy's weakness to Wind!


The enemy's weak to Electricity!


So the enemy is weak to Light...


This enemy is weak to Darkness.


It seems slashing is useless...


So strike attacks won't work...


This enemy can't be pierced...


Looks like Fire won't work here.


So Ice has no effect...


Wind won't be of any use.


Electricity isn't going to work.


Light attacks are useless here.


Looks like Darkness has no effect.


Charm would be effective here. Do you have any way to inflict it?


Poison would work well—might be worth trying.


If you can distress the enemy, you might find an opening.


Confusion may be useful here. Shall we give it a try?


The enemy's susceptible to fear. Double down on the pressure!


This one seems short-tempered. Maybe you can enrage them.


There's an enemy with an ailment. That's an opening for us!


The enemy's in poor condition. That gives us an advantage!


Ailment detected on enemy Shadow. Let's make the most of this!

==========================================================


I've never seen one this big before, but there's no time... We have to end this, now!


Ngh... It called in reinforcements! Just what we needed...


The monorail is going even faster now! You're running out of time!

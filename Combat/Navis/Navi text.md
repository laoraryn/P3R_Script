Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - I'm detecting a powerful enemy up ahead! Everyone, stay sharp.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - There's a powerful enemy up ahead! Please be careful if you plan on taking it on!

------

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'm picking up signs of a valuable treasure chest. Collect it if you can.

Fuuka Yamagishi
There seems to be a valuable treasure chest nearby. Do you think you could collect it?

------

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - This floor... There's a locked treasure chest here. Can you try finding and opening it?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I'm getting a reading on a locked treasure chest! It'd be great if we could collect it.

------

Mitsuru Kirijo
That golden Shadow is in here somewhere... It'll be a good chance to gain a wealth of experience.

Fuuka Yamagishi
It seems a rare Shadow is on this floor! If we can defeat it, it'll surely help level us up.

------

Mitsuru Kirijo
Something's off about the enemy's behavior... Proceed on with caution.

Fuuka Yamagishi
The Shadows are acting strangely...? Please be careful!

------

Mitsuru Kirijo
I can't see as well here... It's difficult for me to follow your readings.
However, the enemy can't detect you either. I'll keep sending you information, so stay alert.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - The visibility here is rather poor. I can manage to see you all, but barely...
At least the enemy won't be able to see you. Please stay calm, and you'll pull through!

------

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - This reading... There's someone here! Hurry and rescue them!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - I'm getting the reading of a person! Please go secure them right away!

------

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'm getting a reading of a small organism... Is this a person? Look around on this floor, just in case.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - I'm getting a faint reading of a living thing...! It could be a person, so please try looking for them.

------

Mitsuru Kirijo
There should be a monorail about 200 meters ahead from where you are now.
Get there as quickly as you can. We don't want any passengers to get hurt.

------

Mitsuru Kirijo
Right, let's begin.
Defeat all the Shadows on that floor.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Each floor's dimensions may vary, but don't feel compelled to explore every inch of each new layout.
Rushing directly for the stairs is a completely viable strategy. I leave that choice to your discretion.

Mitsuru Kirijo
You're likely to find a plethora of these strange mineral deposits scattered throughout Tartarus.
Supposedly, these formations are the crystallized remains of Shadows.
There's sure to be useful materials inside them. When you find one, try cracking it open.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I keep a running record on hand of each area you explore.
After you've established a route, navigating you through it again should be no issue.
However, due to Tartarus's changing nature, these records become useless the next time you visit.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - Judging by the frequency of the signal, this is undoubtedly a stronger foe.
Angry - It would be a wise decision to regroup before approaching...

Mitsuru Kirijo
It would seem your enemies grow stronger with every floor.
Despite the imminent danger, it stands to reason we've gained valuable experience. Let's continue on.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Take care to manage your energy and resources. Don't overexert yourself—sometimes retreating is the smartest option.

Mitsuru Kirijo
How are you feeling? You're not likely to make much meaningful progress when you're worn down.
Be sure to recover if your health is low. It isn't prudent to risk your wellbeing unnecessarily.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Take care to watch your stamina. Knowing when to retreat is as much a life-saving skill as any battle tactic.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - There's trouble waiting for us one floor up. It's like the Shadow we faced on the fifth floor...

Mitsuru Kirijo
I've observed that every few floors, you'll encounter a powerful foe blocking your way.
These "Gatekeepers," as we'll call them, aren't going to simply let you pass—you'll need to be prepared for a real fight.
Ensure you are ready before engaging a Gatekeeper, and make use of teleporters if needed.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Is that...?
There's a rare Shadow up ahead. Perhaps you can ambush it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'm detecting a stronger foe on an upcoming floor. Another Gatekeeper...
It'd be wise to conserve our strength. Have you made use of the **Escape** order?
Happy - A strategic retreat can mean the difference between life and death. You can always regroup and try again.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Take care to watch your stamina. Knowing when to retreat is as much a life-saving skill as any battle tactic.

Mitsuru Kirijo
We're coming up on a tougher foe. Be aware this will be more of a challenge than your standard Shadow.
You can always use a teleporter if you need to regroup beforehand.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Take care to watch your stamina. Knowing when to retreat is as much a life-saving skill as any battle tactic.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I see you're making good progress. And you appear to be getting the hang of things in combat.
On the topic, have you been paying attention to enemy weaknesses?
Happy - Exploiting a weakness will make you hit harder and more often. Doing so can turn the tide of a battle.
The more kinds of attacks you can use, the more chances you'll have to hit a weakness. That's where your ability comes in handy.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Huh, well, well...
Happy - The Shadows on this floor are much weaker than you. This may be a good opportunity to try the "Rush" command.
Rushing can be greatly useful if you're trying to move through a floor without spending much time in battle.
When you choose "Rush," all party members will default to their basic weapon attacks in rapid succession.
While this isn't the most tactically involved strategy, it will allow you to move much faster through combat encounters.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Take care to watch your stamina. Knowing when to retreat is as much a life-saving skill as any battle tactic.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Take care to watch your stamina. Knowing when to retreat is as much a life-saving skill as any battle tactic.

Mitsuru Kirijo
There don't appear to be any enemies on this floor.
Surprised - Wait... What's going on? There aren't any enemies on the next floor either.
...Ah, these seem to be special floors. I'll need you to go up through them for the investigation.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Take care to watch your stamina. Knowing when to retreat is as much a life-saving skill as any battle tactic.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - Hmm... There are more Shadows on this floor than normal.
Angry - They're roaming in droves, and they look particularly formidable. Proceed with caution.

Mitsuru Kirijo
This is some rugged terrain... Keep your eyes peeled for any blind spots.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Take care to watch your stamina. Knowing when to retreat is as much a life-saving skill as any battle tactic.

Mitsuru Kirijo
There's a Gatekeeper on a floor not far from here. Have you healed up recently?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Take care to watch your stamina. Knowing when to retreat is as much a life-saving skill as any battle tactic.

Mitsuru Kirijo
This foe is... unique. I wish there were a way to glean information on them preemptively...
No matter. Once you're in combat, I can analyze our enemies.
Use this information at your discretion. Plan strategically, and you're sure to come out on top.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Have you had a chance to explore status ailments yet?
If you run into a powerful enemy, you may be able to weaken them with a status ailment.
For instance, inflict Distress to diminish their attack, or Confuse them to render them passive.
You'll want to gauge the situation and pick your tactics accordingly.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - Hang on. This floor...
Angry - I'm getting an unusual enemy signal. Stay alert.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Take care to watch your stamina. Knowing when to retreat is as much a life-saving skill as any battle tactic.

Mitsuru Kirijo
By the way, have you been taking advantage of your physical skills?
Physical skills have a chance to knock enemies down regardless of their weaknesses.
Akihiko and Iori specialize in that regard, if I recall.
Happy - Give it a try in the next battle.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Take care to watch your stamina. Knowing when to retreat is as much a life-saving skill as any battle tactic.

Mitsuru Kirijo
There don't seem to be any enemies on this floor.
That should spell some reprieve for us, but it could very well be the calm before a storm.
Fortunately, there's a two-way teleporter nearby, so I'd say a quick regroup may be warranted.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - What? There's no teleporter!?
Angry - We'll just have to barrel through for now. Better be prepared for the worst.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - These battles are just going to keep coming... Hang in there!
Surprised - ...!
Angry - I'm picking up on another **border floor**. It's **seven** floors from here.
Angry - I suppose that means this is a border guard, in a manner of speaking. We've got our work cut out for us. I'm counting on you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
There's a faint enemy presence on a floor much higher up from where we are...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Take care to watch your stamina. Knowing when to retreat is as much a life-saving skill as any battle tactic.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Take care to watch your stamina. Knowing when to retreat is as much a life-saving skill as any battle tactic.

Mitsuru Kirijo
So this is floor forty. The number probably doesn't mean much...
Happy - But this is a veritable accomplishment. Keep up the good work.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Take care to watch your stamina. Knowing when to retreat is as much a life-saving skill as any battle tactic.

Mitsuru Kirijo
If an enemy isn't letting up, consider using skills to buff your allies or enervate enemies.
By raising your defense and lowering an enemy's attack, you may be able to weather the storm.
It's an effective strategy in battles that might get more involved than expected. Think tactically to fight efficiently.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Take care to watch your stamina. Knowing when to retreat is as much a life-saving skill as any battle tactic.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - What? No, it can't be...!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Floors sizes may vary as you explore, but there's no need to check every nook and cranny.
You can just make a beeline for the stairs if that works best for you. The decision's up to you, Leader.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'm sure you've noticed these crystal-like things growing all over this floor.
Supposedly, those are Shadow remains. You'll want to break any you come across.
There might be some useful items inside.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I keep a log of all the places you've explored.
After you've established a route, navigating you through it again shouldn't be a problem.
But only until you leave for the night, since Tartarus changes every day.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - This signal is strong. We've got a tough fight ahead.
Angry - I think it'd be a good idea for us to regroup...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health and stamina are low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
We're making some good progress, but how are you feeling?
Please don't forget to heal as you need it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - There's a powerful enemy on the next floor. It's the same type of Shadow as the one we faced on the fifth floor.

Fuuka Yamagishi
There seems to be an extra powerful Shadow every few floors.
Sad - It's like these Gatekeepers are put here to test us...
Please, if you need to take some time to regroup, use a teleporter to fall back.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Huh? This Shadow's giving off an unusual signal...
It's on this floor. Though I don't get the impression it's particularly strong...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - I'm detecting a stronger foe on a floor not too far off. It must be another Gatekeeper...
It'd be best if you went into that fight refreshed. Have you made use of the **Escape** order?
There's no shame in retreating. Keep that option in mind going forward.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
We're getting close to the Gatekeeper. Stay sharp.
Hopefully there's a teleporter nearby so that we can recoup.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
It's risky to try and progress while your health is low. Please be sure to heal frequently, all right?

Fuuka Yamagishi
There don't seem to be too many powerful Shadows on this floor.
The "Rush" command is most effective when you're up against weaker enemies.
When you order a Rush, the party will default to their basic weapon attacks.
Happy - You won't have the opportunity to make tactical decisions during a Rush, but it will end combat quickly.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I'm not detecting any enemies on this floor.
Surprised - Huh? There aren't any on the next floor either... What's going on?
Maybe it's a special floor. Well, I don't sense any danger, so let's keep going.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
There are so many twists and turns here. Be careful not to get ambushed by any Shadows.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - There's a Gatekeeper on the next floor. Please be careful!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
If you're having trouble against the enemies on one floor, try challenging some Shadows on a lower floor first.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Have you experimented with status ailments yet?
Inflicting ailments can give you an edge against stronger enemies.
For example, Distress lowers attack, and Confuse prevents an enemy from acting.
Happy - Such effects could turn the tide of battle. I think they're worth utilizing if you find an opportunity.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - What IS this!?
Surprised - An enemy on this floor is giving off an abnormal signal. Stay alert.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
By the way, have you been making use of your physical skills?
Physical skills have a chance to knock enemies down regardless of their weaknesses.
Happy - If you're ever unsure about an enemy's weak spot, a basic attack might just do the trick.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I don't detect any enemy presences on this floor.
Sad - This might be a good time to take a break... I have a feeling there's trouble ahead.
You can always use a teleporter if you want to come back to the entrance and prepare.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - No way! There aren't any teleporters here!
Angry - Looks like the only path forward is through... Stay sharp, everyone!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Back-to-back battles... Stay calm, team. You can do this!
Angry - I'm detecting another **border floor** not too far from us. It's... **seven** floors up.
Angry - Once we get past this, it's not much further. In the meantime, I'll do everything I can to support everyone!

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'm sensing another strong presence. It's still a ways away...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
This is the 40th floor. It might be a milestone, but it's hard to tell with Tartarus...
I wonder how tall this tower really is...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
When enemies have you in a tight spot, you can always use support skills.
These skills can buff allies or debuff enemies. Even a single buff could mean the difference between life and death.
Using them effectively, you might be able to wiggle out of a tight spot.
They're also helpful in battles that look like they might drag on, so don't hesitate to use them when needed.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - I remember how helpless I felt being here alone.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - You'll be going up against another Gatekeeper. It won't be an easy fight.
Angry - You can do this, though. I'll do my best to support you from here.
With my **Full Analysis**, I'll be able to give you a complete breakdown of enemy weaknesses on the spot.
And remember that I can use Theurgy as well. Hopefully, it'll come in handy.
Angry - Well, this is it. Stay safe, and good luck, team. I'm here if you need me!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
This brings us to the 50th floor, but we've still a long ways to go...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Enemy defenses seem to be getting tighter by the floor.
Enemies without weaknesses are especially difficult to wear down. That's where status ailments come in handy.
Enemies afflicted with status ailments are more likely to be knocked down by physical attacks.
I know Kirijo-senpai specializes in skills that inflict these ailments.
I really recommend testing combinations of status ailments and physical skills.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - There's a strong enemy on the next floor! Be careful.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Are you sure you're not too tired? Please don't overexert yourself, okay?
If you're low on stamina, do consider coming back.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Huh!? I'm sensing high-level threats all over this floor...
Angry - This entire area is crawling with strong enemies!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - This fight's going to be a tough one... We can't get careless!
Angry - Give it your all. Just say the word, and I'll support you with my Theurgy!
Surprised - Hang on... I'm picking up another signal!
There's another **border floor** coming up. It's **nine** floors from here.
It's still pretty far off... Let's focus on the path ahead of us, first.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
My goodness... This floor is huge, isn't it? I imagine mapping it out in its entirety would be a lot of work...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I think it's incredible how you're able to juggle so many different Personas.
You can practically guarantee favorable match-ups by swapping them out to correlate with enemy weaknesses...
Surprised - Oh, sorry! I was thinking out loud.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Oh! The **floor after this one** is a **border floor**!
Happy - It seems like the coast is clear for now, so you'll get a bit of a break.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Is this... some kind of machine? I wonder what it's powered by...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - What is this place? It feels... different here.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
There's a strong enemy coming up on a nearby floor! Let's be sure to pace ourselves.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
No matter how strong the enemy, there's almost always some way to gain the upper hand.
The key is maintaining your composure long enough to seize the opportunity when it presents itself.
Happy - With that in mind, make sure you're rested and prepared before battle. Can't have you keeling over after the first blow.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Huh? What is this?
It's different from any response I've gotten until now. It's... shrouded.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
There's a Gatekeeper on the next floor. What kind of Shadow could it be this time...?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Do you suppose the Shadows have some reason to keep trying to stop us?
Surprised - This reading...!
**Ten** floors up from here, there's a **border floor**.
That's coming up much sooner than it seems. Let's keep at it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Do you ever wonder—I mean, given how heavy this place must be—whether or not it'll topple over...?
Exasperated* - Then again, it does seem different from your typical building. Probably no use worrying... Hopefully...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
There aren't any enemies here. That's a relief...
Sad - But I have an uneasy feeling about what's ahead. How about turning back for now?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - There isn't a teleporter here, so we'll have to fight our way through.
Angry - Please prepare as best you can!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - We're going straight into another fight, but this is where we test our mettle!
Angry - The **next floor** is a **border floor**. We need to get through this, no matter what!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Yikes... There isn't much cover in this area, so we'll be spotted more easily.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
There are enemies on this floor as well. But...
They're acting strange. Almost fidgety, restless...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Against tougher enemies like these, Theurgy will go a long way.
One option is to have it ready as soon as you enter combat so you can unload a barrage.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Finally, we're on the 100th floor.
That's a mind-boggling number, but the end's not even in sight... Well, there's no hurry, so let's keep a steady pace.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - This again?
Angry - The enemies are acting strangely. Please be careful.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
You've probably noticed the mineral chunks lying around...
Supposedly, there are different types, some of which are quite rare.
The rare ones **give off a blue glow**.
Happy - They yield **Twilight Fragments**, so try breaking them when you spot them.

Fuuka Yamagishi
If you ever feel worn down, please don't be reckless—err on the side of caution and come back to the entrance.
You can keep everyone on the front lines fresh by subbing in new people. That way, progress will be a team effort.

Fuuka Yamagishi
It's still a short ways off, but I'm detecting a strong enemy coming up!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'm getting a slightly different reading from the Shadows on this floor.

Fuuka Yamagishi
It's hard to visualize a building with over a hundred floors, isn't it?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - There are still strong foes ahead, so please prepare as much as possible if you want to keep going.
Surprised - Oh, and is this...?
Yes, there's a **border floor** coming up in **six** floors.
We'll be there shortly if we can win this fight. Ready to do this?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I can't imagine anyone believing us about the Dark Hour or Tartarus...
I mean, I've seen them in person and I can still hardly believe everything that's happened.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
There aren't any Shadows here, but I'm picking up the signal of a certain kind of door.
And the **next floor** is a **border floor**. We've finally hit another checkpoint.
There won't be any enemies here, so you can check out the area without stressing over it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
How are you feeling? Please don't push yourself too hard.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - This is quite the shift in atmosphere... It's more like ruins this time.
Just like before, the enemies are stronger than they were below here. Stay sharp!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - What happened!? It's too dark to make anything out!
Angry - The entire floor's pitch black. Use your map and tread carefully!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
There's a teleporter. A breather might be a good idea...
Angry - I'm sensing a high-level threat on the next floor. Make sure you're ready.

Fuuka Yamagishi
It's another Gatekeeper floor, but this one seems more intimidating than anything we've faced so far...
Focus on the weaknesses and remember your fundamentals!
Plus, I can help too. Just say when, and I'll be ready!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Another fight with no rest in between... I guess all we can do is endure it.
Angry - We'll tough it out together! I'm here to support you any way I can!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Phew... Consecutive battles really test your endurance, but it's such a relief when it's all over.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'm sensing another strong presence. It's still a ways off, though.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Are you sure you're not too tired? Please come back if you have any concerns about your condition.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - There's a strong enemy on this floor. Are you prepared?
There's also a **border floor** coming up in **eight** floors.
We're reaching the final stretch! Hang in there!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
There's another strong enemy up ahead. Don't let up!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
While everyone has different conditions for activating Theurgy...
Happy - Understanding each person's quirks should make it easier to prepare for times of need.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh! The **next floor** is a **border floor**. Just a little more of a push and we're on to the next area.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Floor 145... with the end of the labyrinth nowhere in sight.
There's a strong presence, but it's still a ways ahead of us. Let's take our time getting there.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
It's a little suffocating when the scenery never changes, isn't it?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Watch out for coordinated attacks when facing multiple enemies at once.

It's a long road to travel... If nothing else, please don't force yourself.
We even have a teleporter at our disposal, so let's play it safe.

Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
We're currently on the 158th floor, but there's a strong presence on a floor not too high above us...
There doesn't seem to be a set pattern for where the Gatekeepers are. Let's just focus on one at a time.

Fuuka Yamagishi

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
It's important to know your enemies' weaknesses, but pay attention to the other relevant intel as well.
Knowledge of an enemy's tactics can help you predict their next move.
That means less damage taken and more opportunities to—

Surprised - Oh, what's that...?
Surprised - **Eleven** floors away, I'm sensing another **border floor**.
It's still a ways off. It might be best for you to return.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
There's another strong presence guarding the way to the **border floor**.
It's still a ways away, but we'll want to be ready regardless.

Fuuka Yamagishi

Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
There aren't any enemies on this floor, but there is a teleporter.
The strong presence awaits us on the next floor... How about stopping here for now?

Fuuka Yamagishi
You may have expected this, but there are strong presences on both this floor and the next one.
Angry - Let's get past here first!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - There's only one enemy... But we can't get careless!
Angry - I'm pretty sure this one will hit especially hard. When you feel threatened, raise your guard!
Angry - There's a **border floor** just past here, like before.
Angry - We're in the final stretch of this area! We can overcome this!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi

There's a teleporter here, so make sure you use it if you need to.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
What a colorful wall. I wonder what it's modeled after...

Fuuka Yamagishi
There's a strong presence not too far ahead! You'll want to keep an eye on your stamina.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
The further you climb, the more combinations of enemies you'll encounter.
Choosing your squad based on the enemy types is one useful approach you could take.

You can always restock on consumables, so don't hesitate to use them.
I know it can feel wasteful sometimes, but our top priority is survival, right?

Fuuka Yamagishi
There's a strong enemy waiting a few floors up— Wait, just how many are there...?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
We're almost at the 200th floor. There's another Gatekeeper first, though...
Surprised - We should also be getting close to— Oh!
Yes, I'm sensing a **border floor**! It's **five** floors up from here.
Angry - Just a little further to go. Let's get through here first!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
We've beaten so many strong Shadows... How many has it been so far?
However many it is, we can't get careless now. Let's stay focused!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'm sensing another Gatekeeper! It's still quite a ways off, though...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - We've reached the 206th floor. The floor numbers are unspeakably high now...
Sad - Do you think the floors will ever end? If only we had a clue...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please return to the entrance whenever you're tired, okay?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
There's a strong enemy a few floors above you... What kind could it be this time?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
We've reached the floor with the strong enemy. Please get ready if you intend to confront it now.
Surprised - And... What's this? There's a **border floor** coming up in **eight** floors.
Angry - Keep on pushing and we'll be there in no time. You've got this!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
You've reached the 220th floor. Just how tall is this place?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
There's a strong presence on the next floor. We should start preparing now.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - The **next floor** is a **border floor**...
Angry - I must be picking up the Gatekeeper guarding the path there.
Angry - This won't be an easy fight! You'll need to be ready!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - It's been a long road... But we've made it so far.
Happy - Let's stay calm and keep at it one step at a time.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - The enemies may be no pushovers, but neither are we...
Angry - Let's use what we've learned to teach them a lesson—and I'm here to help, too.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - It's still a ways off, but I'm picking up a strong enemy on a floor above yours.
Angry - I'm anticipating a tough fight, so we'll want to be ready.

Angry - The order you take them out in is going to be the key to your success in battle. Make sure you're thoroughly prepared for them, too.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
There's another high-level threat... It's a few floors up.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - This enemy is going to be a real test. You'll need to be at the top of your game.
Angry - Don't worry, you can win this together. Full speed ahead!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I don't sense any Shadows. This floor seems safe...
Angry - But there's a strong presence on the next floor! And two floors up as well!
Angry - It looks like we're in for back-to-back battles. Let's prepare while we still can.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - No teleporter again... That means we're in for back-to-back battles with strong enemies.
Angry - First things first—let's get through here! Don't hold back!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - All right, on to the next one! Try to prepare as best you can!
Surprised - Huh? Isn't this...?
Surprised - In **nine** floors, we'll be coming up on a **border floor**!
Angry - Could this be the last one? Let's find out for ourselves!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - No way... What's that!?
Sad - I'm sensing a very powerful presence on the next floor.
Sad - And I'm picking up equal-level threats from multiple floors after it... We're in for two fights in a row... No, maybe more!
Angry - This is our toughest test so far... You'll want to be armed to the teeth for this one!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - There's no teleporter... You'll have to defeat them all to get back.
Angry - First round—show it who's boss! I'll support you as best I can!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Round two, coming up! Expect this one to be just as tough as the last.
Angry - You can do it, though! I know you can!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - The third battle... This is the last one!
Angry - The **border floor** is right above us on the **next floor**. We're so close!
Angry - Let's put it all out there! Last big push, everyone!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
We're getting closer to Strega. I'm getting a reading one floor above us.
Sad - Once you cross paths... I don't think you'll be able to avoid combat.
There is a teleporter here, though, so make sure you're prepared.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Going by the signal... they're blocking our path upwards.
Surprised - But there's only one signal... They're not together?
Angry - I don't know what they have up their sleeve, but for now, our only way is up.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please come back to the entrance if your health is low.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - This signal that likely belongs to the Strega leader is fast approaching...
Angry - The next floor is a safe area, so let's get prepared there.

Fuuka Yamagishi
This floor seems safe. You ought to get the team organized and prepare for the upcoming battle here.
Angry - Once you're ready... we'll have to settle the score.

Mitsuru Kirijo
This floor...
There's no mistaking it! Do you recall, Arisato...
How I once told you Tartarus was separated into multiple areas by borders resembling rifts?
I believe... this is one of those **border floors**.
I'm not sensing any enemies. Would you mind taking a look around?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Another dead end... This is as far as we can go for now.
Happy - Nice work—that's another checkpoint under our belt. Come on back whenever you're ready.

Fuuka Yamagishi
A dead end. Looks like we can't progress any further for now...
Happy - On the other hand, we've made good headway—nicely done.
Happy - Come back whenever you're ready. It's your call to make, Leader.

Fuuka Yamagishi
We've made it to the 256th floor.
Sad - ......
Sad - I sense an open area with no walls a few floors up.
That's probably what Ryoji-kun was talking about...
Sad - The way to the Promised Place... That's where we're supposed to go on January 31st.
We've made it this far...
Angry - I have faith in you!
Angry - No matter what's waiting for us ahead, you won't... We won't lose.
Angry - It's time to put it all on the line... This is the fight to end them!

Mitsuru Kirijo
This floor...
There's no mistaking it! Do you recall, Arisato...
How I once told you Tartarus was separated into multiple areas by borders resembling rifts?
I believe... this is one of those **border floors**.
Take a look around for me, would you? Fortunately, there aren't any enemies nearby, but still, don't get careless.

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right, we're here. As I thought, this floor is...
I'm not sensing any enemies. Could you take a look around the area, Arisato?
There's no knowing what might happen, so be careful, all right?

Mitsuru Kirijo
It seems to be a dead end... But I sense something from the walls and floors of this floor.
Perhaps it's the precursor of the place rearranging itself? Take care not to get caught in the action.

Mitsuru Kirijo
This floor seems to be the last of its area.
You should be able to progress now. Go ahead and give it a try.

Fuuka Yamagishi
This floor used to be a dead end...
But I'm sensing that may have changed. Could you search the area?

Fuuka Yamagishi
You should be able to get past the dead end now.
Please be careful not to get caught up in the floor shift...

Fuuka Yamagishi
This area ends here. Now, there's a dead end...
But you should be able to get past it. Could you check?

Fuuka Yamagishi
We've made it to the 256th floor.
Sad - ......
Sad - I sense an open area with no walls a few floors up.
Sad - That's probably what Ryoji-kun was talking about...
Sad - The way to the Promised Place... That's where we're supposed to go on January 31st.

Angry - I have faith in you!

Angry - It's time to put it all on the line... This is the fight to end them!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - You should be able to progress now. Let's go!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The Judgement Social Link reached its maximum level! You can now fuse Messiah, the savior!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - I'm sure there's someone here... Check everywhere, please!

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'm worried about the person who wandered in here... You need to find them before it's too late.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - It's a faint signal, but it's there... You just have to find them!

Mitsuru Kirijo
It's faint, but this signal definitely belongs to a living thing. Locating them is now our top priority.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'm getting a strange signal. Could this be... one of the doors?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sometimes, Tartarus puts up a Monad door on a floor. If you happen to pass one up, it won't open for you during your current exploration.

Fuuka Yamagishi
This signal... There's a Monad door here. Keep your eyes open for it!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Ah— Is that...!?
It's definitely a Shadow, but this is the first I've seen of its type!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Huh!? What the...? I lost a signal from one of the treasure chests!
Sad - Could it be... a Shadow's snatching up treasure on this floor?

Minato Arisato - Selection
It's on now.
Why, though?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Exasperated* - Could it be attracted to the loot somehow?
Surprised - Oh!
Surprised - The Shadow's on the move now!
Angry - It's headed your way—brace for combat!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - It seemed like some kind of rare Shadow...
Exasperated* - Shocking size to it though, right? Yet it got away...
Happy - Given its size, I imagine defeating it would be well worth our while.
Happy - What do you say, Leader?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's hunt it down.
I'm not done with that thing.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - This signal—this movement...!
Angry - The Greedy Shadow's closing in on you!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Exasperated* - There it goes again...
I think we'd get a really nice haul if we could defeat it. Would you like to chase it down?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's chase the thing down.
I'll let it off the hook this time.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - You're kidding, right? Obviously, we go after it, right?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Mr. Sticky Fingers stole our loot! We need to straighten him out.

Akihiko Sanada
Let's see how it carries itself in a fight. No sense letting it go scot-free.

Mitsuru Kirijo
A specimen of that size is certainly a rare sight.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Koro-chan's chomping at the bit! What do you say, Leader?

Aigis
It was so big and golden and shiny... Almost larger than life. What's your decision, Minato-san?

Ken Amada
Happy - It sure was something, wasn't it? Don't you think we should go after it?

Koromaru
Arf, arf!

Shinjiro Aragaki
So... are we goin' after it?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Understood!
Angry - Our target is fleeing at breakneck speed. You'll need to track it down quickly!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Understood. We shouldn't get too distracted trying to chase it.
Let's return to our exploration, shall we?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Understood! In that case...
We can use my Tartarus Search to make sure we corner it!
What would you like to do?

top - FSS_FUKA_ORDER
Please do a .
I'll track it down myself.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Got it!
Angry - Readyyy... Now!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - I'll call out directions for you—follow them to guide the Shadow into a dead end!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Make a left there! You're so close—hang in there!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Make a right!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Left, please!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - It's a right there! Almost there!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Okay, go straight from there! We've got him where we want him!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - D-Do you have something up your sleeve?
Angry - Okay, you're the boss! He's quick though, so be careful!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Well, that was a lucky find, wasn't it? Now that that's settled, shall we get back to exploring?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Back to business for us!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hmm, that device there...
We may be able to use it. Do check it out.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, that device there...
We may be able to use it. Would you mind inspecting it?

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'm sensing a valuable chest nearby. See if you can retrieve it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
There's a valuable chest close by. Can you get it?

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'm detecting a chest that requires fragments to open. Try to find it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - It looks like one of those chests that need fragments to open is around here.

Mitsuru Kirijo
This floor seems like it's connected to somewhere else for some reason...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Is that a... door on this floor? It feels similar to the entrance...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hm... I'm sensing a rare Shadow on this floor.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Oh, it looks like there's a rare Shadow on this floor!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hm, the enemies here seem to be acting strangely...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Huh? The Shadows on this floor are acting weird...

Mitsuru Kirijo
This is quite astonishing... There appear to only be rare Shadows on this floor.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - I thought I detected rare Shadows on this floor, but... only rare Shadows?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - We've got trouble!
Angry - It appears all the enemies on this floor are powerful. Exercise extreme caution!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - What!? These enemies...!
Angry - This whole floor is full of strong enemies! Be careful here!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - It's difficult to see anything on this floor. Keep your guard up!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - It's too dark to make anything out here! Please be careful!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - This is...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - There's a person nearby. It must be one of those missing people who wandered in here...
Angry - I'm getting a signal from floor . Let's hurry!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Are those...? I'm sensing humans nearby! They must be those missing people...
Angry - I'm getting readings from floors  and . We have to rescue them!

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'm getting a faint reading of a person. It could be one of the people who got lost in here...
Sad - It's too far for me to pinpoint their location. They seem to be on a much higher floor...

Fuuka Yamagishi
There's someone in here. It's probably a missing person...
Sad - But they're far away. It seems like they're on a much lower floor.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I sense someone on a higher floor.
Sad - It's a floor we haven't been to yet, though. I hope we can get there soon...

Fuuka Yamagishi
There's another human presence, too. It's coming from above us.
Sad - But they're on a floor we haven't reached yet. I hope we can make it there before it's too late...

Mitsuru Kirijo - MND_TUTO_MONAD01

Fuuka Yamagishi
It doesn't seem like a Shadow... It's larger and seems almost like a wall...

Minato Arisato - Selection
How curious...
Let's take a closer look.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hmm... If it's dangerous, it's possible that it could in fact be riskier to simply ignore it.

Akihiko Sanada
Well, fortune favors the brave, right? Besides, we didn't come this far by running from our fights.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Okay, then. Going by the signal I'm getting, it shouldn't be far from you!

SYS_TUTO_StrongSymbol01
While exploring, you may come across enemies in altered status conditions.
Enraged enemies will rapidly charge at you in a straight line. If combat is triggered, some of the enemies may be afflicted with Rage.
Rage is just one possible altered enemy status. Pay attention to enemies' behavior to glean what you might be dealing with.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The fortune-teller mentioned that
I will "face an adversary clad in gold"...
Maybe I'll run into a rare enemy...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Oh, I should tell you something Kirijo-senpai told me...
Sad - She said there's a Reaper that appears in Tartarus.

Minato Arisato - Selection
A "Reaper"?
"Appears"?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Apparently, it will appear out of nowhere and chase you endlessly...
Sad - And if you get caught, um... I think you know what is supposed to happen if a "Reaper" catches you.
Sad - Maybe it's trying to get rid of us since we're outsiders in Tartarus...?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - She wasn't too sure on the details, but I guess it appears when you stay on one floor for too long.
Sad - **Jamming may not work** on it, so please evacuate to another floor if you ever encounter it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - There are so many enemies, I don't think we'll be able to avoid them entirely...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's just press through, then.
We'll be fine—we have Fuuka.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Please wait! It could be dangerous without a plan...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Um, I appreciate your confidence in me, but I mostly just locate enemies...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Hm... Actually, I may be able to help out here!
Angry - I'm going to use my **Jamming** skill!

Fuuka Yamagishi
**Jamming** obstructs enemy detection, making it harder for them to find you.
In other words, enemies shouldn't attack you even if you enter their line of sight.
It won't always work on all enemies, but for these ones here...
Angry - Help me, Lucia...!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hm? The enemies on this floor seem restless...
Happy - I see... They're intimidated by us. We should be able to avoid any unnecessary combat.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Huh? The enemies on this floor seem strangely agitated.
It looks like they're afraid of us. Maybe you won't have to fight them if you don't want to.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Before fighting a stronger enemy, there's a skill of mine I'd like you to use. It's called **Sylphid Aura**.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - It'll enhance everyone's abilities a bit at the start of battle. It might give you some peace of mind.

Fuuka Yamagishi
If you want to be able to explore a little easier, you might want to use my **Shock Noise** skill.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - It'll inflict Distress on all enemies on a floor so they flee when they see you.

Fuuka Yamagishi
If you ever get stuck somewhere and can't find a teleporter to use...
You can use my skill **Escape Route** to return to the entrance whenever you like.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - If you're running low on health or stamina, please don't push yourself—come back and regroup.

Fuuka Yamagishi
You can use my skill **Tartarus Search** to analyze the floor you're currently on.
Happy - It'll give you a layout of the whole floor, and you can even move right to the next floor if you want.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - It does take stamina, though, so you can't use it over and over, but use it when you need to.

Mitsuru Kirijo
By the way, I received a report from the chairman.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, by the way, the chairman sent me a report.

Mitsuru Kirijo
You know that **clock** by the stairs at the entrance? The one that's about as tall as you?

Fuuka Yamagishi
You know how there's a **clock** about our height next to the stairs at the entrance?

Mitsuru Kirijo
At first glance, it may look ornamental, but it can actually be operated by using **Twilight Fragments**.

Fuuka Yamagishi
It might just look decorative, but it apparently works with **Twilight Fragments**.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Supposedly, it can "restore the user to his or her rightful state."

Fuuka Yamagishi
According to the chairman, it's supposed to "restore the user to his or her rightful state."

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I suppose its purpose is recovery. I'm curious how it works, but regardless, let's take advantage of it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I guess it's supposed to help you recover. It seems mysterious, but I think we should make use of it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hm... I don't sense any enemies above here. We may be approaching a **border floor**.
Reaching it would be a great accomplishment. I'll be counting on you.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, it looks likely that the **next floor** is a **border floor**.
If we make it, that'll be one milestone cleared. Good luck!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Oh, hang on!
I'm picking up on another **border floor** in... **nine** floors.
It's still pretty far off, so let's focus on getting through here first.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Leader, do you have a moment?
I'd like to share something I've found out about using **Theurgy**.
Theurgy can't be used just any time. The user has to reach an emotional peak first.
In other words, Theurgy can only be used **after enough power has built up**.
Also, how someone builds up this power is different depending on the person.
For Kirijo-senpai, it's when she inflicts status ailments on an enemy, but for Yukari-chan, it's when she heals someone.
Try out different things and see what works for different teammates.
Happy - Theurgy is very powerful. We'll definitely want to use it as much as we can.

PFM_SHIFT_GET
You can now perform Shifts in combat.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I had a **Rarity Fortune** read today...
Apparently, **I will face an adversary clad in
gold**. Maybe I'll run into a rare enemy...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I had a **Blighting Fortune** read today...
Apparently, **I will gain an advantage in
conflicts**. I might be luckier in battle...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I had a **Gamble Fortune** read today...
Apparently, **my destiny holds a double-edged
sword**. Maybe I'll run into unusual enemies...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I had a **Soul Fortune** read today...
Apparently, **I will feel a powerful drive**.
My Theurgy gauge may charge faster...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I had a **Safety Fortune** read today...
Apparently, **my destiny holds a moment
of tranquility**. Maybe I'll avoid setbacks...

**Status Ailments** has been added to Tutorials.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Oh, look at that!

Fuuka Yamagishi
There may be items worth gathering on this floor, so keep an eye out.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Over there! Be careful—you're not alone!

Fuuka Yamagishi
It's hard to see anything in this darkness, but that goes for the enemy as well.

------

Minato Arisato - Selection
I'm ready.
Let's not fight yet.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - It's a strong enemy! Are you ready to fight it?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - You'll have to defeat this enemy to move on... Are you ready?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - It's a very powerful enemy! Please make sure you're fully prepared for battle!

------

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - I'm picking up on a large group of enemies ahead!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Even if you took a detour, it's unlikely you'd be able to avoid them entirely...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's just press through, then.
We'll be fine—we have Fuuka.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Please wait! It could be dangerous without a plan...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Um, I appreciate your confidence in me, but I mostly just locate enemies...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Hm... Actually, I may be able to help out here!
Happy - I'm going to use my **Jamming** skill!

Fuuka Yamagishi
**Jamming** obstructs enemy detection, making it harder for them to find you.
In other words, enemies shouldn't attack you even if you enter their line of sight.
It won't always work on all enemies, but for these ones here...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Help me, Lucia...!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Help me, Juno...!

------

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - *gasp* There it is!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Is this... a door? Could you please get a little closer to it for me?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Um, is something wrong? The door isn't that way.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Uh, please wait! There are only stairs up ahead.
I really think we should figure out what's going on, so please come back for now.

------

Mitsuru Kirijo
Wait! Is that Shadow up ahead a...!?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please wait a moment! The Shadow up ahead might be a...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Well, now... That Shadow took off like a bandit, didn't it?
Those ones are fairly rare... I suppose we can simply call them "rare Shadows."
They can be tough to catch, but the potential rewards are worth the trouble.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It seems to have turned left up ahead. Why don't you try tracking it down?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Wow, it took off quickly, didn't it?
I believe that's an unusual breed called a "rare Shadow."
They're real fast on the run, but catching them apparently yields big rewards.

Fuuka Yamagishi
It looks like it made a left up ahead. Would you mind pursuing it?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Is something the matter? Track down that rare Shadow before it gets away.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please try tracking down that rare Shadow first.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Ah, it seems to have escaped... I told you it'd be tough to catch, didn't I?
Well, the next time you see one, I want you to try engaging it in battle.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, it got away... They really are fast, aren't they?
If you see one again, try your best to catch up to it and fight it.

------

Mitsuru Kirijo
There's a Shadow up ahead...
I'll take this opportunity to teach you about Shifting.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I see. So, basically, we're working together to battle more effectively!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Aw snap! It'd be sweet if we could pull this kinda thing off a lot, huh?

Mitsuru Kirijo
In combat, you should be as coordinated as possible. Put it to good use.

------

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - Wait!
Angry - There's an enemy nearby, but...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - It's in a league of its own, far different from the run-of-the-mill Shadows in this area.
Angry - This will be a tough fight. If you're not feeling confident, then don't engage in combat.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - Should we enter battle, retreat is a viable option.
Angry - We need a leader capable of making level-headed decisions so we don't end up in dire straits.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - ...Hang on!
Angry - I'm sensing an enemy nearby, but, um...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - This Shadow seems a bit tougher than the other ones in this area.
Angry - It'll be a tough fight, so if you think you can't handle it, try to avoid combat.

Fuuka Yamagishi
If you do get caught, it'd be wise to retreat immediately.
And, most importantly, please don't make any reckless decisions. We need you to keep a calm head.

------

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - I'm detecting a major presence upstairs! It has to be our target!
Angry - It's hiding in **a larger room on the third floor**. Head that way and track it down!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - I'm sorry... I only sensed the one Shadow.
Surprised - And I hate to bear more bad news on top of this, but...
Sad - A barrier has gone up within the building... You won't be able to reach it this way.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - So we can blame that Shadow for getting us trapped down here...

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'm going to try and find a way to break this barrier. In the meantime, please reconvene on the second floor.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Is everyone all right?
Sad - It seems that breaking the wrong mirror will cause the Shadow to target you.
Try breaking the **mirror in Room 205**.
I'm certain that will trigger something. Please head there right away!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Is everyone all right?
Sad - It seems that breaking the wrong mirror will cause the Shadow to target you.
Try breaking a mirror that **doesn't show your reflection**!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Are you all okay?
Sad - It looks like that wasn't the right mirror. This Shadow is determined...
It may be hard to tell in the darkness, but remember: you're looking for a **mirror that doesn't show your reflection**!
Keep searching. I'll do what I can to hone in on its location!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Is everyone okay? I hope you can forgive me for not being of much help...
But I've finally got a lock on the reading! You have to break **the mirror in Room 304**!
**Room 304** isn't far. Please hurry and find it!

------

Fuuka Yamagishi
We did it!
Happy - The enemy's been defeated. Great work, everyone!
I'll be waiting outside for you.

------

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Arisato-kun!
Please wake up, Arisato-kun!

------

Fuuka Yamagishi
...There was a slight accident, but let's focus on the mission for now.
I feel the target's presence from beyond that door.
Once you're ready, we can go.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - I sense the target two blocks ahead of you!
Angry - It seems to be moving slowly downward.
Angry - Don't let it get away!

MSG_000_0_0
UNUSED

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - The last Shadow is floating in front of us...
Angry - I'm not sensing any movement from it.
Angry - Let's prepare here... then head for battle.

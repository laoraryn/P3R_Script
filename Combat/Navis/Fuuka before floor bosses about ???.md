Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Hm...?
Sad - I just sensed something unusual run by up ahead.
Sad - I wonder what it was... It seems to have gone down to a lower floor.

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Multiple Shadows ahead! It looks like they've been waiting for us!
Surprised - And that strange presence is there too! The same one from before!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Huh!?
Surprised - It's gone...? I don't sense it anymore...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - Shadows incoming! Be careful!

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - What's that!?
Sad - It just went down a floor...
Sad - I know I've sensed it before...

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - There! A Shadow!
Very angry* - Wait, and over there...!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Oh, it disappeared again...
Very angry* - Well, never mind that. Just focus on the enemy in front of you!
Very angry* - Here it comes!

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - I'm getting that strange reading again!
Sad - I wonder if it's a Shadow... I can't tell for sure.
Sad - But it feels... familiar...

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - Shadows confirmed! And wait... There's that presence again!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - I wonder...
Sad - Could that strange figure be summoning the Shadows waiting for us...?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - Get ready!

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - I'm getting that reading again. And it's... in the form of a human?
Sad - That's so strange... It feels just like a real person.
Sad - But... How could there be anyone else here?
Sad - Huh...

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - More Shadows!
Very angry* - And that figure... It doesn't seem like it wants to attack us, though.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - Anyway, concentrate on those Shadows for now!
Very angry* - Brace yourselves!

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - That human-like figure again...
Sad - I wonder if it has some sort of purpose here...

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - Another Shadow!
Sad - If that figure is summoning these Shadows... I guess it's an enemy...
Sad - But then... Why does it seem so similar to...?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - Um, anyway, it still seems like it won't attack, so focus on the Shadow!
Very angry* - You can do it!

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - I'm sensing it again...
Sad - There is something about it that doesn't quite seem actually human, but...
Sad - ......
Sad - I'm sorry, I wish I could be more specific, but I don't know anything for sure yet...

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - Again... The Shadow is the only one that seems aggressive...
Very angry* - Look out!

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - There it is again...
Sad - It... It has to be...

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - These readings I've been getting... There's no other possibility...
Sad - It could only be...
Looking away - But... It can't be...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Sorry! I didn't mean to distract you.
Angry - Shadows approaching!

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Maybe that figure has been showing itself to lure us in...
Sad - Which must mean there's something it wants us to see further down...
Sad - ......

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - ......

Fuuka Yamagishi
Looking away - I get the feeling we'll end up meeting that figure whether we chase it or not...
Sad - We're getting close... Let's keep moving.
Angry - Watch out for the Shadows!

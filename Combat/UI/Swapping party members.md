Alright.

Hey, no vacancies.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Who do I sub in for?

Shinjiro Aragaki
I haven't taken one of these big ones on before...

Shinjiro Aragaki
Got it.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...What?

Shinjiro Aragaki
Tch, don't think I'm up to it?

Shinjiro Aragaki
Don't treat me any differently. It's annoying.
I'll fight how I want to fight. That's it.

Shinjiro Aragaki
I hate this shitty place, no matter how many times I come back.
Three Shadows left? I'll get rid of them in no time flat.

Shinjiro Aragaki
*sigh* I had a hunch it'd come to this...
Well, what's done is done. No choice but to get ready.
It's nothin'. Just talkin' to myself.

Shinjiro Aragaki
I'm ready for some action today. No time to waste—let's get going already.

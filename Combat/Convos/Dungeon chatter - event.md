### One-way teleporter

Yukari Takeba
We could head back, but... it's your call.

Junpei Iori
One teleporter sighted! It'll take us back to the entrance, but I'm down to keep going.

Junpei Iori
...That'll take us back to the entrance, but you ain't wussin' out, right?

Akihiko Sanada
That's a one-way teleporter... But there's no need to head back yet.

### Two-way teleporter

Yukari Takeba
That will take us to the entrance. Should we head back...?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Takeba is severely exhausted. Perhaps we ought to head back.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Yukari-chan looks exhausted. Don't overdo it, okay?

Junpei Iori
Hey, that's our ticket back. Whaddaya say?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Iori is low on stamina. Retreat could be a viable option...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Junpei-kun, are you okay? Maybe you should come back.

Junpei Iori
We ain't headin' back, right? Dude, I'm fine...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Junpei-kun, what's gotten into you...?

Akihiko Sanada
...That teleporter will take us to the entrance. What's your call, Arisato?

Mitsuru Kirijo
It's important to know when to fall back. I'll trust your judgment regardless.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sanada-senpai's running low on stamina. Try not to overexert yourselves.

Mitsuru Kirijo
This teleporter takes us to the entrance. I'd appreciate a chance to regroup...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Kirijo-senpai looks really worn out...! Would you consider heading back?

Aigis
One-way teleporter discovered... Shall we use it?

Aigis
That's a one-way teleporter. What should we do...?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Leader, I'm worried about Aigis. Maybe we should stop here for tonight?

Ken Amada
Oh, a teleporter! Should we head back, Arisato-san?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Amada-kun looks tired... It might be a good idea to head back.

Koromaru
*pant* *pant* *whine*

Fuuka Yamagishi
Are you okay, Koro-chan...? Leader, maybe that's enough for tonight?

Shinjiro Aragaki
We ain't stoppin' here...? Whatever, do what you want.

Koromaru-san seems to be pleased. Well done.

Aigis
Well done, Koromaru-san. Let's keep up the good work.

Shinjiro Aragaki
C'mon... Let's get going.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Didn't even stand a chance...

Shinjiro Aragaki
Let's go.

### After an AOA

Yukari Takeba
That went pretty well!

Yukari Takeba
Let's do the same thing for our next fight!

Junpei Iori
...Nailed it! Nice going, Junpei!

Junpei Iori
Haha, perfecto!

Junpei Iori
...C'mon, let's go.

Junpei Iori
...Not like it was hard.

Akihiko Sanada
That certainly went well.

Akihiko Sanada
Good teamwork, everyone. Now, on to the next!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Perfect. Just what we hoped for.

Mitsuru Kirijo
That was excellent leadership. Keep up the good work.

Aigis
That was a spectacular finish.

Aigis
We beat them to a pulp, as they say.

Aigis
Victory is ours! Now, let's keep going.

Aigis
Excellent teamwork! As always, of course.

Ken Amada
Nice! That went well!

Ken Amada
I'm always happy to team up with everyone!

Koromaru
Arf! Arf!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Heehee! You looked really cool out there, Koro-chan!

Koromaru
Arf!

Aigis
Koromaru-san appears satisfied with our performance.

Aigis
...Yes, hopefully our next battle ends just as smoothly.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...That went better than expected.

Shinjiro Aragaki
...Guess having a team ain't so bad.

### Reaper - too low level

Mitsuru Kirijo
These readings... Stay alert, Arisato!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Be careful... Something feels wrong.

Fuuka Yamagishi
This reading... It's the Reaper!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Leader, something dangerous is approaching!

Mitsuru Kirijo
...The Reaper's appeared! Get out of there!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Look out! Reaper's appeared!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Is this reading... the Reaper!?

Fuuka Yamagishi
The Reaper showed up! Be careful, everyone!

Yukari Takeba
Oh god, what do we do!?

Yukari Takeba
Wha—!? Let's run!

Junpei Iori
Crap, what do we do?

Junpei Iori
Oh shit, we better bounce!

Junpei Iori
Whatever, I can take 'im...!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Junpei-kun, don't be so reckless...!

Akihiko Sanada
Dammit, we can't fight now... It's too risky.

Akihiko Sanada
Guess our only choice is to fall back...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Dammit! Run, now!

Mitsuru Kirijo
We've stayed here for too long...

Aigis
A formidable foe has appeared. How do we proceed?

Aigis
The enemy is dangerous. I recommend avoiding contact.

Aigis
The enemy is too strong...! Let's escape to a safer location!

Aigis
It's the Reaper... Let's leave this floor before it comes after us!

Ken Amada
That doesn't sound good... We better get out of here!

Ken Amada
We've stayed here for too long...! Let's escape!

Koromaru
Grrr...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Koro-chan has his guard up, too!

Koromaru
Woof!

Fuuka Yamagishi
I think Koro-chan can sense danger, too!

Shinjiro Aragaki
Shit, here it comes...

Shinjiro Aragaki
...Run like hell—unless you got a death wish.

### Reaper - fighting chance

Yukari Takeba
This doesn't look good, but... maybe we've got a fighting chance?

Yukari Takeba
I'd rather not fight, but... what do you wanna do?

Junpei Iori
We miiight stand a chance? Just barely, but we'll be fine!

Junpei Iori
Heh, if we gotta fight, I got your back, bro!

Akihiko Sanada
...This'll be fun. Bring it on.

Akihiko Sanada
We're in for a fight... But I've got this.

Mitsuru Kirijo
We'll need to prepare ourselves if we engage in combat.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'd rather avoid fighting... But it's your call, Arisato.

Aigis
An encounter will lead to a difficult battle. Let us stay on high alert.

Aigis
Though it may be a difficult battle... I'm prepared to meet it head on.

Ken Amada
...Wh-What's the plan? Do we even stand a chance...?

Ken Amada
If it's that dangerous, then it'd be better to run for it, right?

Koromaru
Grrr...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Koro-chan has his guard up, too!

Koromaru
Woof!

Fuuka Yamagishi
I think Koro-chan can sense danger, too!

Shinjiro Aragaki
If you're lookin' for a fight, then get ready.

### Reaper - high level

Yukari Takeba
Crap, this is bad!

Yukari Takeba
Hurry, we've gotta run!

Junpei Iori
Damn, there it is!

Junpei Iori
Oh man, this is bad!

Junpei Iori
Hey, what now?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please, just calm down, Junpei-kun!

Akihiko Sanada
Damn, it's out for blood...!

Akihiko Sanada
It's coming... You got a plan!?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Not good...! Fall back!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Ngh, just our luck...

Aigis
Powerful hostile approaching...!

Aigis
Danger! Fall back at once!

Aigis
A powerful enemy is approaching...!

Aigis
Everyone, I sense danger!

Ken Amada
We can't fight! Let's run...!

Ken Amada
Wh-What do we do!?

Koromaru
Grrr!

Fuuka Yamagishi
It's the Reaper! Everyone, you need to escape!

Koromaru
Grrrrr...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Koro-chan, look out...!

Shinjiro Aragaki
Get it together if you don't wanna die.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Shit! It found us...!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - I'm sure there's someone here... Check everywhere, please!

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'm worried about the person who wandered in here... You need to find them before it's too late.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - It's a faint signal, but it's there... You just have to find them!

Mitsuru Kirijo
It's faint, but this signal definitely belongs to a living thing. Locating them is now our top priority.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'm getting a strange signal. Could this be... one of the doors?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sometimes, Tartarus puts up a Monad door on a floor. If you happen to pass one up, it won't open for you during your current exploration.

Fuuka Yamagishi
This signal... There's a Monad door here. Keep your eyes open for it!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Ah— Is that...!?
It's definitely a Shadow, but this is the first I've seen of its type!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Huh!? What the...? I lost a signal from one of the treasure chests!
Sad - Could it be... a Shadow's snatching up treasure on this floor?

top - SEL_HIGH_RARE_TUTO_00
It's on now.
Why, though?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Exasperated* - Could it be attracted to the loot somehow?
Surprised - Oh!
Surprised - The Shadow's on the move now!
Angry - It's headed your way—brace for combat!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - It seemed like some kind of rare Shadow...
Exasperated* - Shocking size to it though, right? Yet it got away...
Happy - Given its size, I imagine defeating it would be well worth our while.
Happy - What do you say, Leader?

top - SEL_HIGH_RARE_TUTO_01
Let's hunt it down.
I'm not done with that thing.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - This signal—this movement...!
Angry - The Greedy Shadow's closing in on you!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Exasperated* - There it goes again...
I think we'd get a really nice haul if we could defeat it. Would you like to chase it down?

top - SEL_HIGH_RARE_00
Let's chase it.
Let's let it go.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - You're kidding... Obviously we go after it, right?

Junpei Iori
Happy - That greedy Shadow stole our loot! We gotta straighten it out!

Akihiko Sanada
Let's see how it carries itself in a fight. No sense in letting it go scot-free.

Mitsuru Kirijo
A specimen of that size is certainly a rare sight.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Koro-chan's raring to go! What do you say, Aigis?

Aigis
It was huge and glittered like gold... It was almost larger than life. What do you think, Minato-san?

Ken Amada
Happy - It sure was something, wasn't it? Don't you think we should go after it?

Koromaru
Arf, arf!

Shinjiro Aragaki
So... are we goin' after it?

Metis
Happy - It seems like that would help you, Sister! C'mon, let's take it down!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Understood!
Angry - Our target is fleeing at a breakneck speed. You'll need to track it down quickly!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Understood. We shouldn't get too distracted from our objective by chasing it.
Let's return to our exploration, shall we?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Understood! In that case...
We can use my skill Tartarus Search to make sure we corner it!
What would you like to do?

top - FSS_FUKA_ORDER
Please do a .
I'll track it down myself.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Got it!
Angry - And... now!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - I'll call out directions for you—follow them to chase the Shadow to a dead end!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Make a left there! You're so close—hang in there!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Make a right!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Left, please!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - It's a right there! Almost!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Okay, go straight from there! We've got it where we want it!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - D-Do you have something up your sleeve?
Angry - Okay, you're the boss! He's quick though, so be careful!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Well, that was a lucky find, wasn't it? Now that that's settled, shall we get back to exploring?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Okay, back to business!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hmm, that device there...
We may be able to use it. Check it out.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, that device there...
We may be able to use it. Would you mind inspecting it?

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'm sensing a valuable chest nearby. See if you can retrieve it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
There's a valuable chest close by. Can you get to it?

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'm detecting a chest that requires fragments to open. Try to find it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - It looks like one of those chests that open with fragments is around here.

Mitsuru Kirijo
For some reason, this floor seems connected to somewhere else...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Is that a... door on this floor? It feels similar to the entrance...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hm... I'm sensing a rare Shadow on this floor.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Oh, it looks like there's a rare Shadow on this floor!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hm, the enemies here seem to be acting strangely...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Huh? The Shadows on this floor are acting weird...

Mitsuru Kirijo
This is quite astonishing... There appear to be only rare Shadows on this floor.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - I thought I detected rare Shadows on this floor, but... why are they all rare Shadows?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - We've got trouble!
Angry - It appears all the enemies on this floor are powerful. Exercise extreme caution!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - What!? These enemies...!
Angry - This whole floor is full of strong enemies! Be careful!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - It's difficult to see anything on this floor. Keep your guard up!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - It's too dark to make anything out here! Please be careful!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - This is...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - There's a person nearby. It must be one of those missing people who wandered in here...
Angry - I'm getting a signal from floor . Let's hurry!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Are those...? I'm sensing humans nearby! They must be those missing people...
Angry - I'm getting readings from floors  and . We have to rescue them!

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'm getting a faint reading of a person. It could be one of the people who got lost in here...
Sad - It's too far for me to pinpoint their location. They seem to be on a much higher floor...

Fuuka Yamagishi
There's someone in here. It's probably a missing person...
Sad - But they're far away. It seems like they're on a much lower floor.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I sense someone on a higher floor.
Sad - It's a floor we haven't been to yet, though. I hope we can get there soon...

Fuuka Yamagishi
There's another human presence, too. It's coming from above us.
Sad - But they're on a floor we haven't reached yet. I hope we can make it there before it's too late...

Fuuka Yamagishi - MND_TUTO_MONAD01

Fuuka Yamagishi
It doesn't seem like a Shadow... It's larger and seems almost like a wall...

top - SEL_TUTO_MONAD
Interesting...
Let's take a closer look.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hmm... If it's dangerous, it's possible that it could in fact be riskier to simply ignore it.

Akihiko Sanada
Well, fortune favors the brave, right? Besides, we didn't come this far by running from our fights.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Okay, then. Going by the signal I'm getting, it shouldn't be far from you!

SYS_TUTO_StrongSymbol01
While exploring, you may come across enemies in altered status conditions.
Enraged enemies will rapidly charge at you in a straight line. If combat is triggered, some of the enemies may be afflicted with Rage.
Rage is just one possible altered enemy status. Pay attention to enemies' behavior to glean what you might be dealing with.

Aigis - Thoughts
The fortune-teller mentioned that
I will "face an adversary clad in gold"...
Maybe I'll run into a rare enemy...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Oh, I should tell you something Kirijo-senpai told me...
Sad - She said there's a Reaper that appears in Tartarus.

top - SEL_TUTO_REAPER
A "Reaper"?
"Appears"?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Apparently it will appear out of nowhere and chase you endlessly...
Sad - And if you get caught, um... I think you know what is supposed to happen if a "Reaper" catches you.
Sad - Maybe it's trying to get rid of us since we're outsiders in Tartarus...?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - She wasn't too sure on the details, but I guess it appears when you stay on one floor for too long.
Sad - **Jamming may not work** on it, so please evacuate to another floor if you ever encounter it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - There are so many enemies, I don't think we'll be able to avoid them entirely...

top - SEL_TUTO_JAMMING
Let's just press through, then.
We'll be fine—we have Fuuka.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Please wait! It could be dangerous without a plan...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Um, I appreciate your confidence in me, but I mostly just locate enemies...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - Hm... Actually, I may be able to help out here!
Angry - I'm going to use my **Jamming** skill!

Fuuka Yamagishi
**Jamming** obstructs enemy detection, making it harder for them to find you.
In other words, enemies shouldn't attack you even if you enter their line of sight.
It won't always work on all enemies, but for these ones here...
Angry - Help me, Lucia...!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hm? The enemies on this floor seem restless...
Happy - I see... They're intimidated by us. We should be able to avoid any unnecessary combat.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Huh? The enemies on this floor seem strangely agitated.
It looks like they're afraid of us. Maybe you won't have to fight them if you don't want to.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Before fighting a stronger enemy, there's a skill of mine I'd like you to use. It's called **Sylphid Aura**.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - It'll enhance everyone's abilities a bit at the start of battle. It might give you some peace of mind.

Fuuka Yamagishi
If you want to be able to explore a little easier, you might want to use my **Shock Noise** skill.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - It'll inflict Distress on all enemies on a floor so they flee when they see you.

Fuuka Yamagishi
If you ever get stuck somewhere and can't find a teleporter to use...
You can use my skill **Escape Route** to return to the entrance whenever you like.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - If you're running low on health or stamina, please don't push yourself—come back and regroup.

Fuuka Yamagishi
You can use my skill **Tartarus Search** to analyze the floor you're currently on.
Happy - It'll give you a layout of the whole floor, and you can even move right to the next floor if you want.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - It does take stamina, though, so you can't use it over and over, but use it when you need to.

Mitsuru Kirijo
By the way, I received a report from the chairman.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, by the way, the chairman sent me a report.

Mitsuru Kirijo
You know that **clock** by the stairs at the entrance? The one that's about as tall as you?

Fuuka Yamagishi
You know how there's a **clock** about our height next to the stairs at the entrance?

Mitsuru Kirijo
At first glance, it may look ornamental, but it can actually be operated by using **Twilight Fragments**.

Fuuka Yamagishi
It might just look like a decoration, but it apparently works with **Twilight Fragments**.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Supposedly, it can "restore the user to his or her rightful state."

Fuuka Yamagishi
According to the chairman, it's supposed to "restore the user to his or her rightful state."

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I suppose its purpose is recovery. I'm curious how it works, but regardless, let's take advantage of it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I guess it's supposed to help you recover. It seems mysterious, but I think we should make use of it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hm... I don't sense any enemies above here. We may be approaching a **border floor**.
Reaching it would be a great accomplishment. I'll be counting on you.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, it seems likely that the **next floor** is a **border floor**.
If we make it, that'll be one milestone cleared. Good luck!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Oh, hang on!
There's another **border floor** coming up. It's **nine** floors from here.
It's still pretty far off, so let's focus on getting through here first.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Leader, do you have a moment?
I'd like to share something I've found out about using **Theurgy**.
Theurgy can't be used just any time. The user has to reach an emotional peak first.
In other words, Theurgy can only be used **after enough power has built up**.
Also, how someone builds up this power is different depending on the person.
For Kirijo-senpai, it's when she inflicts status ailments on an enemy, but for Yukari-chan, it's when she heals someone.
Try out different things and see what works for different teammates.
Happy - Theurgy is very powerful. We'll definitely want to use it as much as we can.

PFM_SHIFT_GET
You can now perform Shifts in combat.

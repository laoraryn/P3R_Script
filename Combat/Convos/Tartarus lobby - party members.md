## Aigis

Commencement of the operation is imminent. Please consider having me accompany you.

I will be sure to display my fullest abilities.

Shall we depart immediately?

Understood.

The party currently contains a sufficient number of combatants.

Would you like to remove someone else so that I may join?

Will we be heading out soon? If so, please take me with you.

Happy - I will do my very best!

Shall we get going, then?

I understand...

Oh, it seems that the party is already full.

Should I replace someone?

I understand...

Understood.

The party is already at capacity.

I am prepared to initiate combat.

I am ready to proceed.

I understand...

The party seems to already be full...

Aigis
Angry - A strong will—regardless of what form it takes—makes a person stronger.
Angry - So we shouldn't underestimate our enemy... I will do whatever I can to protect you.

Aigis
Angry - It seems our opponent is trying to buy time... Let's defeat him quickly.
Angry - We must keep moving forward.

Aigis
His view of life and death differed from ours, but even still, he was fighting for something...

Aigis
...Anyway, we should get going. Our true enemy still lies ahead.

Aigis
He has put us through numerous ordeals... But let's try to stay calm as we face him.
Angry - We mustn't let him take the upper hand. I suspect he has gained significant strength since last time.

Aigis
Angry - Let's hurry. Our goal is within reach.
Angry - I'm ready whenever you are.

Aigis
Sad - He's a human, just like the rest of you... yet he has such different values...
But I suppose that's what it means to be human. And that is why I value you...

Aigis
Angry - It is finally time for our last battle.
Angry - I promise I'll protect you. That is why I'm here.

Aigis
I'm ready.

Aigis
Let's end this once and for all.

Aigis
All right.

Aigis
This facility appears to be abandoned. I do not sense any biological material outside our group.
I am prepared for combat. Please allow me to accompany you.

Aigis
It is possible to destroy the sealed door. However, there's a possibility the entire facility will collapse.
It is inadvisable to risk putting everyone in unnecessary danger.
Additionally, ensuring destruction of the target remains our primary objective.

Aigis
Junpei-san appeared emotionally distraught. I do not fully comprehend...
Regardless, would you like me to join you on the front line?

Aigis
Unlike the previous operation, we will now be facing two enemies at once.
I anticipate the use of coordinated attacks. Extra precautions may be necessary.

Aigis
My social communication data suggests the phrase "What's the holdup?" may be relevant.
What's the holdup?

Aigis
Our ultimate objective will be completed once we defeat that Shadow.
I... will fulfill my mission.

Aigis
There is insufficient room in the party.

Aigis
Do you require my firepower?
I am able to deploy anytime.

Aigis
Let's get crackin'.
...Which is to say, "Let's begin our course of action," in more casual terms.

Aigis
Let us begin.
The time for battle is afoot.

Aigis
I suggest promptly going after Junpei-san.
We likely do not have much time to spare.

Aigis
From this point forward, I will be available for use in combat.
I will accept all orders, so please provide them at your discretion.

Aigis
According to Amada-san's profile data, he should be dormant in his bedroom at this time.
Therefore, it is highly unlikely that Amada-san will be able to detect our current activities.

Aigis
So "summer school" is a phenomenon in which everyone gathers at school during break to study.
I will file this under, "Things Many People Find Annoying."

Aigis
Koromaru-san does not speak, but appears able to understand some degree of human language.
I anticipate no problems in his understanding of your battle commands.

Aigis
It seems many students do not start their summer homework until the last day of summer break.
Of those living at the dorm, Junpei-san appears the most in danger of falling into this trend.

Aigis
Amada-san is young, but appears to have no difficulty summoning and using his Persona.
Therefore, age does not seem to influence the power of a Persona.

Aigis
The overall strength of the team has greatly increased with the addition of Aragaki-san.
More strategic options are available as well. You may find it worthwhile to experiment.

Aigis
It is probable that Chidori-san possesses great knowledge about Strega.
However, I anticipate difficulty in receiving that information from her.

Aigis
Three Shadows remain, but it is unknown how strong they are or how exactly they act.
Underestimating the enemy may prove more dangerous than the threat of the enemy itself.

Aigis
The situation involving Aragaki-san appears to be having a negative effect on the rest of the group.
This drop in morale may prove hazardous when attempting to explore Tartarus.

Aigis
I will fulfill the duties given to me. For that purpose, I will continue to fight.
Let us fight together to the end.

Aigis
I am sorry for causing so much trouble...
I will do whatever I can to make up for it, so... please allow me to continue staying by your side.

Aigis
Ryoji-san is dangerous.
I apologize for the digression... but I must insist on this point, no matter what.

Aigis
Junpei-san's emotional state remains dismal.
I worry that it may take a long time for him to recover...

Aigis
Happy - People around the world are having fun, celebrating the new year.
Happy - I want to be able to greet the new year in the same way next year, and the year after that.
Happy - So let's fight and never give up, Minato-san.

Aigis
I want to be with everyone...
And I want to continue staying by your side.
No... I don't just want it; I know it will happen. I will not stop believing that it will.

Aigis
I want to continue living alongside everyone...
If there is any obstacle we must overcome for my wish to come true, then...
Angry - We will surely overcome it, no matter what!

Aigis
The treasure chests in Tartarus contain various items.
I recommend searching for these treasure chests while exterminating Shadows.
You will not be charged with theft for taking the contents, so there is nothing to worry about.

Aigis
Happy - Minato-san...
Happy - I will always do everything I can to protect you...

Aigis
Happy - We are spending time together yet again. It's as if we're starting where we left off after school...
Happy - Oh, sorry, I did not mean to distract you. Haha...

Aigis
I feel I will be able to exert maximum possible output today. Follow my lead! As they say.

Aigis
Happy - Today, I'm feeling exceptionally powerful. No enemy will be able to stand in our way!

## Ken

Please bring me with you for tonight's exploration.

Happy - Okay! I'll do my best!

I'm ready to go when you are.

Okay...

Um, it looks like your party is already full.

Should I change with someone?

Oh, it looks like there's no more room...

I'll give it my best!

Okay, got it.

We should get going, right?

Oh, okay. I understand...

Ken Amada
Angry - I won't let anyone get in our way! We have to keep going!
Angry - I'm ready...!

Ken Amada
Sad - I'm sure they've gotten stronger since last time...
Angry - But so have we! So if we just...

Ken Amada
Why would he...?

Ken Amada
...We have to keep going. We have to fight Nyx...

Ken Amada
Angry - We'll settle this once and for all this time...
Angry - Please, allow me to fight!

Ken Amada
Angry - I can't lose... because I said I'd go on for him...
Angry - So I won't let Strega or anyone else stop me! Let's go!

Ken Amada
Sad - Maybe, in a way, these guys actually weren't that different from me...
Angry - But that doesn't matter right now. Let's go!

Ken Amada
Happy - Don't worry. I'm looking straight ahead.
Happy - Let's go, Senpai.

Ken Amada
If I'm being honest... I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared...

Ken Amada
All right.

Ken Amada
Let's finish this.

Ken Amada
Whose place should I take?

Ken Amada
Angry - So those guys have come here, too... I won't let them get in our way!
Angry - Please let me go with you!

Ken Amada
Angry - I'm worried about Junpei-san... We should go after him, quickly.
Angry - Let me know what I can do to help!

Ken Amada
I wonder where Junpei-san went...

Ken Amada
Sad - So much has happened, but...
Angry - That's why we have to end this! I know we can do it!

Ken Amada
Angry - We'll win, no matter what.

Ken Amada
Angry - We have to put a stop to this...
Angry - I can go whenever you're ready.

Ken Amada
Who should I switch with?

Ken Amada
Angry - I can do it.
What are you going to do?

Ken Amada
Angry - We should go after Junpei-san, quickly.
Angry - I can go whenever you're ready.

Ken Amada
Don't worry about me. Something like Tartarus doesn't scare me at all.

Ken Amada
I heard that Aragaki-san used to fight alongside Sanada-san and Mitsuru-san.
He certainly seems strong, but I'm not so sure about him...

Ken Amada
If we beat the last three Shadows, it'll all go away, right?
The Dark Hour, the Lost, even Tartarus...

Ken Amada
I'm all right now.
I can still fight, so please don't worry.

Ken Amada
Angry - I decided that I would fight in his place...
Angry - That's why I'll defeat them all. The Shadows here, and the very last Shadow...

Ken Amada
Sad - Irresponsible adults do whatever they want and only leave behind problems for everyone else...
Sad - Tartarus is a prime example of that.
Sad - I never want to become that kind of adult...

Ken Amada
Sad - I wonder if Mitsuru-san is okay...
Sad - The rest of us too, for that matter. We don't really know what to do anymore, do we...?
Well, we'll just have to do what we can.

Ken Amada
Happy - Mitsuru-san seems different now.
Happy - She seems more positive than she did not too long ago.

Ken Amada
Junpei-san hasn't eaten much since... that.
I understand how he feels, but... it's worrisome.

Ken Amada
Sad - The end of the world, an inescapable death...
Sad - Maybe we would be happier if we didn't know...
Sad - ......

Ken Amada
Happy - I know what I'm going to do, and I'm not going to let anything distract me.
Happy - I'll do everything I can with all I've got.
Happy - That's how I stay motivated for the battles in Tartarus.

Ken Amada
I never really thought about what I want to do or be in the future before.
But I've been thinking about that kind of stuff a lot lately.
Angry - ...We have to beat Nyx, for sure.

Ken Amada
Today's fight will decide everything. Our future... and the future of the whole world, even...
I'm kind of nervous, but... I'm not worried. It's a strange feeling...
Happy - I know that we can win.

Ken Amada
Fighting in Tartarus sure is tiring...
Oh, but I'm okay, though. I'm tougher than I look, you know.

Ken Amada
Tartarus can be really different just floor to floor.
Some floors are creepy, but the next floor could be really flashy...
It's strange.

Ken Amada
Happy - Please leave it all to me today! Those Shadows won't stand a chance!

## Shinjiro


We're goin' in, right?

Well, let's get it done.

...What're you waiting for?

Alright.

Hey, no vacancies.

Who do I sub in for?

I haven't taken one of these big ones on before...

Got it.

...What?

Tch, don't think I'm up to it?

Shinjiro Aragaki
Don't treat me any differently. It's annoying.
I'll fight how I want to fight. That's it.

Shinjiro Aragaki
I hate this shitty place, no matter how many times I come back.
Three Shadows left? I'll get rid of them in no time flat.

Shinjiro Aragaki
*sigh* I had a hunch it'd come to this...
Well, what's done is done. No choice but to get ready.
It's nothin'. Just talkin' to myself.

Shinjiro Aragaki
I'm ready for some action today. No time to waste—let's get going already.

------

## Fuuka


I'll support you all from here. Is there anything I can do for you?

Is there anything else?

I believe the highest you've gotten is floor .

For now, please try going as high up as you can.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - We managed to get as far as we can for the time being. I guess we can say mission accomplished?
Happy - Great job, everybody.

Fuuka Yamagishi
We've climbed to the very top of the tower, so we accomplished our objective, but...
After everything we've gone through, we couldn't find anything in Tartarus—not even a single clue.
Sad - But why... do I feel so uneasy?

Fuuka Yamagishi
We've climbed as far as we can go for now... But it seems like there's still quite a ways to go before we're done.
I wonder what lies ahead...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Looks like we've gotten as far as we can go.
I guess all we have to do now is wait until January 31st...

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'll be here to provide backup from now on.
When I'm geared up just like everyone else, it really gets me psyched up.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Are you ready?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - It's dangerous to go with the party as is. Please add more teammates to your lineup.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please be careful out there.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I sense that... the enemies are even stronger than last time.
Brace yourselves for some tough battles ahead. I'll also do my best to support you.

Fuuka Yamagishi
......
...I'm sorry. I shouldn't be hesitating at a time like this...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Even though he's all alone, he'll still stand against us...
Let's head out once we've finished our preparations. He should be waiting for us up ahead.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - The top is just up ahead...
We finally made it... We finally conquered this tower.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Just a little farther...
Until our final battle.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Let's focus on the Shadow right now. Please choose who will join you on the front lines.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'm picking up the target's signal from a spot somewhere below here.
Sad - But it's kind of like... multiple readings overlapping? I can't really tell for sure.
Sad - What on earth could it be...?
We don't know what we're up against this time either, so be ready for anything.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'll get ready to provide support, so you can head on over.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Let's get going.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Well then, we're off.

Shuji Ikutsuki
All right. Be careful.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Let's go!

Fuuka Yamagishi
This will be our final battle... Let's get through this, together.

Fuuka Yamagishi
The Shadow is floating in the air, showing no signs of movement.
Angry - If we get close, it'll turn into a bloodbath. Make sure you're fully prepared for battle.

Fuuka Yamagishi
From now on, I'll be providing support in Kirijo-senpai's stead.
I'll do my best to make exploration easier on everyone in any way I can.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Little by little, I'm starting to get used to providing support.
Happy - You can count on me to have your back.

Fuuka Yamagishi
The last battle really did a number on you the other day...
The enemies have gotten stronger, too, so I'll do everything I can to support you.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I've only ever seen Yakushima in pictures, but I hear it's supposed to be a beautiful place. Isn't this exciting?
Oh, but we have to focus on exploring Tartarus right now. Let's pull it together and move out.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I wonder how they managed to build Aigis...
The Kirijo Group's technology is really impressive— Oh, um, sorry. Now's not the time to be thinking about all that.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Amada-kun is really put together. And he speaks so politely, too.
I'm sure his parents really cared about him...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Having to attend summer school is... kind of depressing, honestly.
Happy - But maybe I'll be able to concentrate with everyone around. Let's just do our best.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Looks like I'll be able to provide Koro-chan backup the same way I do for everyone else.
He seems to understand human speech, and we're all able to figure out what he's feeling.
He's a really smart dog. Isn't that right, Koro-chan?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Summer vacation really went by in a flash, didn't it? This year especially...
I guess maybe that's because we were busy every day, one way or another.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Amada-kun sure is amazing, isn't he? Even though he's so young, he's really determined.
It makes me want to do my best to support him.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Now that Aragaki-senpai's joined us, we've gained even more firepower.
Happy - I guess that only makes choosing your party lineup harder, but this is something only a leader can do.

Fuuka Yamagishi
It seems that Kirijo-senpai is also looking into Strega.
But I wonder... Just where did that girl get an Evoker?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Now there's just three Shadows remaining...
The end of our battle is in sight. I'll back you up, all the way to the very end.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Sanada-senpai and Amada-kun are starting to pick themselves up. We should follow their example...
I'll be all right. As always, I'll provide backup.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Once we defeat the next Shadow, Tartarus should disappear for good.
Keep up the hard work, and don't lose focus until the very end.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Just what have we been doing all this time...?
Sad - We believed that this was it, that this would be the end...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - There's no way Kirijo-senpai's okay... considering everything that happened.
Sad - I'm worried about her, but giving her some space might be what's best for now...

Fuuka Yamagishi
If you're sorry about what happened during the school trip, it's okay. I'm not upset anymore.
Since Kirijo-senpai, um... executed you guys on our behalf.
Anyway, let's focus on the task at hand and get back to exploring.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - It looks like Kirijo-senpai's recovered... Thank goodness.
Happy - I knew she could overcome her grief.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Is Junpei-kun going to be okay...?
Sad - I've been trying to think of something that could make him feel better, but...
Sad - ...I guess it's not easy to bounce back after what happened.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - I can't stop thinking about Ryoji-kun's words...
Sad - ......
Sad - I'm sorry, I'll try to concentrate.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I know things are tense right now, but I'm really looking forward to Christmas...
Happy - Because... I want to spend it with you.
Happy - S-Sorry... I just feel so flustered even though I'm the one who said all that.

Fuuka Yamagishi
It's a new year.
The Promised Day is fast approaching...
I can't let my nerves get the best of me right now... Let's go about this like usual.

Fuuka Yamagishi
We'll do everything we can to protect our ordinary, everyday lives and our future— No, we must.
We don't have much time left until the Promised Day. Let's keep building up our strength for the final battle.

Fuuka Yamagishi
It's the Promised Day... The day we fight Nyx for our future.
As long as we stand together, I believe we can overcome anything.
Let's make it through this, make it to tomorrow... so we can meet up on graduation day.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - On days we go to Tartarus, I have a smaller dinner.
Happy - I get really sleepy after eating a big meal.
Oh, I'm not tired right now though. You don't have to worry about me.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Every few floors, the Shadows seem a little different.
It might be a good idea to change up your party lineup every now and then. That way, it'll be easier to target an enemy's weakness.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I always find it thrilling whenever everyone attacks the Shadows all at once.
You should execute those attacks when you get the chance!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Everyone on standby is also warming up for their turn.
We'll be able to swap out teammates at any time, so please try not to overexert yourself.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Y-You're too close...
It... It'd be too embarrassing if you could hear how loudly my heart is beating.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Looks like we'll be together the whole day.
Happy - Hehe, let's explore as much as we can.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I'm feeling pretty good today. I'll be sure to support everyone as best as I can!

## Junpei


You know you're gonna need my help. We good to go?

Happy - Alright, let's do this!

C'mon, let's get going.

Sad - *sigh* Fine, I get it...

Surprised - Yo, what gives? You already got a full team!

So who am I gonna switch with?

So who am I gonna switch with?

Happy - You got it, dude!

Sad - Alright...

Let's get goin', man.
Surprised - Dude, what!? I'm not just dead weight... Right?

Sad - The team's already full, man.

Junpei Iori
Angry - Alright, let's do this!
Happy - I'll prove that I should be in charge!

Junpei Iori
Sad - Dude, I can't take it anymore...
Sad - I'm starvin'...

Junpei Iori
Happy - It's all you, dude.
Happy - I'll hold things down here, so go give 'em hell!

Junpei Iori
I got your back!

Junpei Iori
Just don't die, man...

Junpei Iori
Sad - Dude, there's no room.

Junpei Iori
You want me to switch with someone?

Junpei Iori
Alright... You ready to get this show on the road?
Happy - You're lookin' at your ace in the hole!

Junpei Iori
I'm ready whenever.
Happy - Just leave it all to me!

Junpei Iori
Tch... If he was so smart, why didn't he do something more useful with his life?

Junpei Iori
Well, no point thinkin' about it too much... Let's go.

Junpei Iori
Angry - That asshole's up next, right? Mind letting me come with?
Angry - I got some unfinished business with him...

Junpei Iori
Angry - I guess it's not like beating the shit outta him will suddenly fix everything, but...
Angry - Anyways, we gotta get past him either way. You ready to do this?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Alright, now it's time for the real battle...
Happy - Let's end this with a bang!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Heh, we'll be fine. We got this.
Happy - Your cleanup hitter, Junpei Iori, is gonna knock it outta the park!

Junpei Iori
Alright, let's get going.

Junpei Iori
Somethin' up? C'mon, let's go.

Junpei Iori
Angry - The hell was up with them? Poppin' in to preach all high and mighty just to hightail it...
Angry - You bastards think we're scared of bein' locked up!? ...Whatever. Let's do this!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Yo, I'm gettin' kinda psyched!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - C'mon, man... You got a full party already!

Junpei Iori
So who do I switch with?

Junpei Iori
Angry - This'll be my first time goin' to a place like this, y'know? Man, I'm gettin' butterflies...

Junpei Iori
Angry - We're so close... Let's kick some ass, man.
Surprised - Hey, am I gonna be in the starting lineup?

Junpei Iori
I wonder what Amada and Aragaki-san are up to...
Surprised - Wait, you think this is their way of saying they're leaving things in my capable hands...? Dude...

Junpei Iori
Angry - Last up is that big boy, huh?
Angry - Alright, this is my time to shine! I'll take us all the way home, baby!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Let's do this!
Happy - I'm ready to step up to the plate! Let's get this done!

Junpei Iori
Sad - Okay, fine... But you better not lose, alright?

Junpei Iori
Sad - Dude, there's no more room.

Junpei Iori
Who do I swap spots with?

Junpei Iori
Angry - I'm not gonna let them have their way.
Surprised - But hey, uh, you're not gonna bench me, right?

Junpei Iori
Happy - I don't care where those enemies come from. I'll smash 'em down one right after another!
Happy - You can count on me!

Junpei Iori
That stuff that happened on the monorail was friggin' crazy, man.
I kinda wanna make it into like a script for a TV show or something, but I probably can't...
Sucks... I bet it woulda been kickass, too...

Junpei Iori
Sanada-san's back.
Happy - I'm glad I finally have a rival that can stand up to my good looks!

Junpei Iori
Junpei's Believe It, or Don't is a smash hit! Its rise into continued popularity knows no bounds!
Even in the blistering heat of summer, Junpei's Believe It, or Don't will make you shiver in fear!
...Heh, I'm just messin'.

Junpei Iori
That guy who saved us, Aragaki-san, was real tough, huh?
He took that dude down with a single headbutt! I don't care who you are; that's just badass.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Kirijo-senpai's beautiful fencing, and Fuuka's soothing voice...
Happy - Truly an oasis in the desert!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Ta-dah da-daah! Junpei has leveled up!
...I wish I could say that like a hundred times a day.
The more I level up, the more awesome I get!

Junpei Iori
...What? NOW you need somethin' from me?
Tch...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Dude, I'm so pumped for Yakushima!
Happy - I'm thinkin' about it so much, even Tartarus is starting to look like the beach to me.

Junpei Iori
Ai-chan is amazing...
She's so cute, but she can also shoot bullets from her fingers!
It's a good thing she's on our side... It'd suck to have her as an enemy.

Junpei Iori
Sure, Amada's mature for his age...
But don't you think Yuka-tan's giving him too much credit?
It'd be nice if she praised me like that once in a while...

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - I seriously can't believe we have to go to summer school!
Sad - Maybe if I just stay in Tartarus, I won't have to go...

Junpei Iori
Now that Koromaru's on our side, things are gonna be better than ever!
With so many team members, Tartarus is gonna be a lot funner! ...I hope.

Junpei Iori
Man... Summer break's almost over...
Well, at least I can still make some beautiful memories here in Tartarus...
Exasperated* - ...Like anyone could do that!

Junpei Iori
Amada's just in elementary school, but he's so determined. It's kind of amazing, y'know?
Me, on the other hand...

Junpei Iori
Aragaki-san is our senpai in school and in SEES... Oh, and in Personas! He's like a triple senpai!
If he asked me to go buy him some yakisoba pan, there's no way I could turn him down...
But what if he asks me to in here? I mean, there's no yakisoba pan in Tartarus!

Junpei Iori
Since I began talking to Chidori, I've been thinking a lot...
Ya know... I've never really thought that deeply about things like life and death and stuff...

Junpei Iori
Angry - Those dudes from Strega are prolly gonna come out during the next full moon, huh?
Angry - I can't lose... for me, or for Chidori...

Junpei Iori
There's no way I could accept my death so easily like that...
Aragaki-san is amazing...

Junpei Iori
When Tartarus disappears, the first thing I'm gonna do is go see Chidori.
Happy - Haha, kinda makes me feel like I'm a hero in a video game or somethin'.
Happy - "Then, I will check up on the fair maiden after I have defeated the final enemy!" Heheh...

Junpei Iori
Sad - So Ikutsuki was playin' us the whole time...
Sad - The more I think about it, the more I hate Tartarus...

Junpei Iori
Dude, Kirijo-senpai looks pretty rough... It's like there's no life in her...
But I don't blame her.
If I lost someone close to me, I'd probably be like that, too...

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - Man, I'm still sore... Kirijo-senpai didn't have to go that far with her "execution."
After that, we shouldn't even be here tonight. We're working too hard...

Junpei Iori
I wonder if something happened to Kirijo-senpai on the school trip.
I mean, she was so depressed, but she seems fine all of a sudden.
...Well, I'm glad she's okay, at least.

Junpei Iori
...Chidori gave me my life.
And it's not just my own now. I have to take care of it...

Junpei Iori
Angry - Ryoji dropped a real bomb on us, didn't he?
Angry - The world is ending? How can I just accept that!?

Junpei Iori
Ai-chan is different now. I dunno, it's like... her face seems brighter, or somethin'.
Well, I haven't stopped growing yet, either! I'm still gonna level up like crazy!
So let's go!

Junpei Iori
Happy - It's the top of the final inning!
Happy - Let's fight and level up and blast Nyx into outer space!

Junpei Iori
Man, I guess this is the last night we'll be calling you "Leader," huh, Minato?
Kinda hard to call you that outside of Tartarus. We'd get a lot of weird looks at school.
Happy - Well, I guess we'll just have to come up with a new nickname to call ya starting tomorrow!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Don't say anything about exams!
Surprised - I don't wanna think about 'em while I'm in Tartarus!

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - Gaaahhh, I'm so hungry!
Exasperated* - Tartarus... Tartarus... Tartar sauce...
Oh, crap... I want some deep-fried shrimp to munch on now...

Junpei Iori
I wish there was a convenience store inside Tartarus.
They could have all kinds of stuff, and we wouldn't have to worry about going hungry!
I wish the Kirijo Group would really make one here...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Come on out, Shadows... Don't worry, I won't bite...
Happy - I'll just chop you up into itty-bitty pieces!

## Mitsuru

Would you like for me to accompany you?

I won't let you down.

All right, then let's move out.

...I see.

There are no vacancies in the party...

Who should I switch with?

Very well.

All right, let's go.

We have too many party members on the front lines.

Who should I switch with?

All right... Be careful.

We're short on time. Hurry.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Don't worry. I won't push you too hard.
You'll be just fine.

Mitsuru Kirijo
From now on, you'll be selecting party members to join you in exploring Tartarus.
I'll explain in detail some other time.
Très bien! You did well today. Now, let's head back to the dorm.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I can finally fight at your side now.
On top of that, we have new battle gear and equipment. Hopefully, you'll find me reliable...

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'll stay here and provide support. Is there anything I can do for you?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Anything else?

Mitsuru Kirijo
The furthest you've gotten is floor .

Mitsuru Kirijo
Please explore as much of Tartarus as you can.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Looks like we've gone as far as we can. Mission accomplished—at least, for now.
Good work.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...Who would you like me to switch with?

Mitsuru Kirijo
We're putting everything on the line in this one battle. I'm sure he's doing the same as well.
That's why... we can't afford to lose, not here.

Mitsuru Kirijo
There's no time to deliberate.
Let's prepare for battle and put this matter to rest.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Refrain from expressing your pity... It's an insult to the defeated.

Mitsuru Kirijo
There's no time for regrets.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hurt - The Kirijo Group... cannot possibly hope to atone for our sins.
Angry - But that doesn't mean we should stop trying. For the sake of the hopes and dreams entrusted to us, we must struggle and persevere.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Let's go. We have a long way until we reach our goal.
...What? I'm ready to go anytime.

Mitsuru Kirijo
We've finally made it this far.
This wouldn't have been possible without all of you. I cannot possibly thank you enough.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Let's go. It's time to take back our future.
I'm ready to fight.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sorry to put you through all this...

Mitsuru Kirijo
All right.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It'll be over after this.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...There are too many people in the party.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...Who should I switch with?

Mitsuru Kirijo
We'll worry about how to escape later. Defeating the Shadow takes priority.
Do you want me to go?

Mitsuru Kirijo
This is an unexpected turn of events, but destroying the target remains our priority.
Let's depart immediately once you're ready.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Do not be distracted by your surroundings. Focus on your objective.
We're here to defeat Shadows.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Everything will finally come to an end tonight.
Do you want me to go with you?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Well then, we're off.

Shuji Ikutsuki
All right. Be careful.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Let's go!

Mitsuru Kirijo
We have to go after Iori immediately. We'll deal with the fallout as it happens.
If it comes down to a fight... do you need me to join you?

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'm surprised that Shadow took over the underground cables...

Mitsuru Kirijo
We don't have the luxury to fuss over those who aren't even present.
Concentrate on the enemy in front of us.

Mitsuru Kirijo
There's no telling when they'll start to rampage.
We'll take them on with our current roster. Let's begin immediately once you're ready.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I see... Be careful.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I truly am grateful to everyone. Thank you for remaining steadfast from beginning to end.
I'll fight to the best of my ability.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It was a long journey to get to this point...
And it all ends today. Let's do this.

Mitsuru Kirijo
...Be careful.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Who should I switch with?

Mitsuru Kirijo
This will be a tough battle.
But I'm ready to see it through till the end.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It's dangerous for Iori to be on his own right now.
Let's depart as soon as possible.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Have you gotten used to fighting Shadows? Well, regardless, there's no rushing progress.
I have high hopes for all of you. There is no doubt in my mind you are all up to the task.

Mitsuru Kirijo
We're all still here today thanks to your quick thinking on the monorail.
Considering your ability to act during the unexpected...
You make not just a fine Persona-user, but leader as well.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Akihiko's recovery means that we can now have four members on the front lines.
You'll be able to test out different battle strategies now. Give it a go.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Logic and science dictate that ghosts are not real...
But it's hard to deny the existence of other paranormal entities with the Dark Hour and Shadows around.

Mitsuru Kirijo
You never know when a large and stronger Shadow, such as the one from the monorail, may appear.
Use the time you have now to explore Tartarus and hone your abilities.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Yamagishi can act as support for the team.
Therefore, I'll be fighting alongside you all from now on. It's good to be back on the front lines.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'm glad to see that Yamagishi is adapting quite well.
She's a reliable support, which means I can concentrate on fighting.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Our enemies have arsenals of different attacks at their disposal, like the Shadow from the other day.
The ability to act swiftly will greatly affect the outcome of battle.
Make sure you glean as much experience as you can on a daily basis.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Gekkoukan High may be closed during summer break, but Tartarus won't be.
I know this is a tall order, but I'm counting on you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I never imagined we'd gain such a powerful ally in Yakushima.
Nevertheless, it's great that we're bolstering our ranks.
It may be harder on you as the leader, but I'm counting on you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Amada may try to act like an adult, but he's still in elementary school.
He seems to look up to you as a role model, so please try to help him out where you can.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Summer school may be draining, but you need to focus while in Tartarus. Pull yourself together.
Getting distracted for even a split second can lead to major injury. Concentrate on the battle in front of you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
"Strega"...
I didn't know there could be other Persona-users...

Mitsuru Kirijo
I won't lecture you about doing your summer homework while we're here.
Of course, I trust you've already finished it... Correct?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Amada is still a novice at basic combat, so we must support him.
As the team leader, I expect you to instruct him properly.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Aragaki has always been a morally upright fighter.
He never strays from his beliefs, and it shows in his fighting style.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Our battle against Shadows is about to come to an end...
And, hopefully, without much issue.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Amada has matured greatly after what had happened...
Doubtless, Aragaki would be proud to see how much progress he's made.

Mitsuru Kirijo
We've visited Tartarus so often, and now it's on the verge of disappearing entirely...
It's a relief, yes, but we can't take it easy just yet...
I know I've repeated this time after time, but don't let your guard down until the very end.

Mitsuru Kirijo
......
...Oh, apologies.
I shouldn't be lost in thought like this while in Tartarus.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'm sorry for causing you all trouble.
I'm fine now, so don't worry about me.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Iori will need time to get back on his feet...
Of course, I intend to support him in every way I can, but...
This is something he has to overcome on his own.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Rather than wasting time mourning the end of the world, we should get moving.
Let's focus on defeating the Shadows that stand in our way.
Having your thoughts wander while in Tartarus might just cost you your life.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I suppose we'll celebrate Christmas while fighting enemies inside Tartarus.
It's not quite the traditional way for couples to celebrate, but... Well, it's certainly unique. I can appreciate that.
Happy - Though I suppose the only reason I feel that way is because you're right beside me.

Mitsuru Kirijo
The phrase "time is money" has never resonated with me until now.
Even during the Dark Hour, we're pressed for time.
That's why you ought to spend it wisely, so that you have no regrets later on.

Mitsuru Kirijo
There's not much time left until the battle with Nyx... Regardless of what happens, know that this is our only shot at victory.
But I believe, after everything we've been through, we'll be all right.
We'll get through this together, as a team.

Mitsuru Kirijo
This is the final Dark Hour... We've had a long and perilous journey.
But now's not the time to reflect on the past. Our battle's not over yet.
We can reminisce all we want after tonight.

Mitsuru Kirijo
If only there was a practical exam on defeating Shadows at school.
That way, we could explore Tartarus while studying.
Well, such unrealistic dreams are better left as that—dreams. Our time would be better spent studying hard for school.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Everyone has their own unique fighting style. There are those who prefer to go on the offense and others who prioritize defense.
It's up to you to decide how you want us to act in battle. I have high expectations for you.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Don't hesitate to retreat if you're feeling exhausted. It's best not to overexert yourself.
A real leader knows when to surrender.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Sad - D-Don't stand so close to me.
Sad - I don't know how to keep my cool around you...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - We've been together the whole day, haven't we?
Happy - I guess that proves how much I rely on you...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - I'm feeling good today. You can count on me.

## Akihiko

Okay, here we go.

Happy - That's what I like to hear!

All right, let's get going.

Well, it's up to you. All right, then...

Looks like the party's already full.

Who should I switch with?

Whose place should I take?

The party is already full.

Should be a worthy opponent. You ready?

All right.

Leave it to me.

Remember, Takeba and Junpei have no real battle experience, so make sure you back them up.

Akihiko Sanada
You guys did a great job, but you won't have to shoulder the burden forever.
Sad - I'll help you out too... Just as soon as this damn injury is healed...

Akihiko Sanada
"Theurgy," was it? I'm looking forward to seeing how it works.
That aside, let's handle this like we always do. It's Mitsuru's first real battle in a while, too.

Akihiko Sanada
We all want to finish this, but don't get careless.

Akihiko Sanada
Got it.

Akihiko Sanada
The party's full.

Akihiko Sanada
Who should I switch with?

Akihiko Sanada
If they're so willing to take us on again after last time, they're either very confident...
Or they've got something up their sleeve. But it doesn't matter either way—we won't lose.

Akihiko Sanada
What're you waiting for? Let's go.
If they insist on getting in our way, then I'll just clear the way with my fists.

Akihiko Sanada
I hope Shinji's giving that Jin guy a piece of his mind right about now...

Akihiko Sanada
Anyway, let's hurry. We can't afford to waste too much time here.

Akihiko Sanada
Looks like we'll get a chance to settle this before we can move forward.
Angry - You gotta let me fight this one with you, Arisato.

Akihiko Sanada
All right, you ready, then?
Angry - Let's show him what we're made of!

Akihiko Sanada
There's no one left in our way.
The stage is set and our opponent's waiting. I'll give it everything I've got.

Akihiko Sanada
This is it. Everything will be decided by this fight.
Happy - I only made it this far because everyone here was in my corner. Now let's go grab our victory.

Akihiko Sanada
I got this.

Akihiko Sanada
What're you waiting for?

Akihiko Sanada
Then who should I switch with?

Akihiko Sanada
Our path of retreat's been cut off, and we're locked in a cage with the Shadow.
Heh, this should be interesting.

Akihiko Sanada
All right, let's get to it.

Akihiko Sanada
The party is already full.

Akihiko Sanada
Who should I switch with?

Akihiko Sanada
Don't get overconfident.

Akihiko Sanada
A Shadow and Strega... Fine. We'll take 'em both out in one fell swoop.
I'm warmed up and ready to start when you are.

Akihiko Sanada
I don't know what to expect, but if Strega's involved...
It could be a trap, but we don't have much of a choice right now. Let's go.

Akihiko Sanada
Whatever our opponent's like, it doesn't matter. It makes no difference to my fists.

Akihiko Sanada
Hey, so about Shinji...
...Never mind. This is no time to get distracted. You ready?

Akihiko Sanada
Yeah, all right.

Akihiko Sanada
Hm? What's up?
Make sure you're confident with whoever you're bringing into battle.

Akihiko Sanada
Yeah, all right.

Akihiko Sanada
The party's full.

Akihiko Sanada
Now our true battle begins.
Let's go. Time for the final round.

Akihiko Sanada
All right, let's go.

Akihiko Sanada
You ready?
Let's knock it out in one round!

Akihiko Sanada
This isn't about revenge...
This is about doing what needs to be done.

Akihiko Sanada
Huh... Her again...
I'm concerned about Junpei. Let's move.

Akihiko Sanada
I can finally move around the way I want to again.
Of course, I continued to train even while I was recovering.
So I shouldn't be any less capable now. You can count on me.

Akihiko Sanada
I'm looking forward to learning the truth behind those ghost stories.
Well, good luck with it.

Akihiko Sanada
You have to get stronger in order to protect yourself.
And fighting in real battles is the best way to train for future battles, so let's go.

Akihiko Sanada
Mitsuru's coming back to fight, and Yamagishi will be providing assistance.
Battles are going to get more interesting. As the leader, you better get motivated.

Akihiko Sanada
The further up we go, the stronger our enemies become.
Make sure you know all our strengths and weaknesses.
I don't want us to get wiped out because we were careless.

Akihiko Sanada
I didn't expect the Shadows at the hotel to attack us mentally.
It was a good lesson in expecting the unexpected, even if it wasn't exactly an enjoyable experience.

Akihiko Sanada
Our trip to Yakushima's coming up, but don't start slacking just yet.
The Shadows aren't going to take it easy on us.

Akihiko Sanada
Honestly, I thought an "anti-Shadow weapon" would be something more imposing...
But, for the most part, she looks just like a regular human.
Well, I'm sure she'll seem more like a weapon in battle.

Akihiko Sanada
The news of Amada joining us in the dorm sure was unexpected, even if it's only temporary.
Honestly, I've got reservations about this... But that doesn't matter right now.
Getting distracted by outside things while in Tartarus is only going to end in failure.

Akihiko Sanada
If you don't want miserable test scores, you should take advantage of your summer classes.
What'll be your excuse if you get poor grades? "I was fighting monsters in the school at night"?

Akihiko Sanada
Unlike us, Koromaru can't tell us when he's hurt.
We'll have to keep a close eye on him.

Akihiko Sanada
Are you bummed that you're spending your summer break exploring Tartarus?
Well, think about it like this: it's a unique experience most people will never have.
Happy - How's that for summer memories?

Akihiko Sanada
Shadows will attack anyone, even children.
I'm impressed with Amada. He asked to join our group, even though he knew the risks.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - I can't believe I can fight alongside him again...
Happy - I'm glad I was persistent.

Akihiko Sanada
There are only three more Shadows...
The countdown has begun... But don't let your guard down until it's all over.

Akihiko Sanada
Don't bring your emotions into Tartarus.
That may sound cold, but your life is constantly on the line here.
If you let yourself get distracted, you'll just be making yourself an easy target.

Akihiko Sanada
We'll be saying farewell to Tartarus soon.
I'd always wanted it to disappear, but now that it's actually going to happen, it doesn't feel real.
Well, I'll be sure to raise as much hell as I can here in the meantime.

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - Of course, right when we thought Tartarus was finally going to disappear...
I guess we have to keep putting up with this damn tower.

Akihiko Sanada
Are you worried about Mitsuru?
Well, I don't think there's anything we can do...
Just worry about yourself for now. You never know when a Shadow's going to attack.

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - Tartarus seems like heaven compared to the hell of Mitsuru's execution.
Sad - ......
Sad - Though it's pretty pathetic thinking that way, too...

Akihiko Sanada
I'm relieved Mitsuru's back to her old self.
Now I can fully concentrate on Tartarus.

Akihiko Sanada
I know that if we push Junpei forward, he'll be able to take that first step towards getting better.
The problem is figuring out how to do it...
I wish there was a good way.

Akihiko Sanada
You probably have a million things running through your head, but focus on Tartarus for now.
Getting yourself killed before the world ends would just be pathetic.

Akihiko Sanada
The battle with Nyx will be tough.
We have to train as much as we can beforehand.
And the Shadows are always getting stronger too. Don't underestimate them.

Akihiko Sanada
I tried thinking about what the battle with Nyx would be like, but I gave up pretty quickly.
Shinji would be disappointed with me.
He'd say something like, "If you've got time to daydream, you've got time to fight."

Akihiko Sanada
This day has been a long time coming...
There's no point getting antsy on the day of the fight. But you probably know that by now.
Let's leave it all in the ring.

Akihiko Sanada
Shadows spawn without limit here. In terms of sheer numbers, they've got the upper hand.
To offset our disadvantage, we'll have to strategize. Exploiting weaknesses is an example.
But the first strike is crucial, too. Don't let them see you coming.

Akihiko Sanada
If you skimp on items, you'll be sorry when you take a wallop from an enemy.
But using items excessively isn't good either.
Figuring out a good balance for item use is an important part of combat strategy.

Akihiko Sanada
Hey, put me on the attack today. I'm itching for a good fight.

## Yukari


Ready to go?

Happy - All right, let's go!

Wanna get going? I'm ready when you are.

Okay...

It looks like there's no more room...

Want me to switch with someone?

Okay, let's go.

All right.

C'mon, let's get going.

Sad - Okay... Be careful.

Oh, there isn't any room...

So this is Tartarus...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I'm exhausted...
Sad - Let's call it a day, okay?

Yukari Takeba
Oh, by the way, do you know what those numbers on our new armbands mean?
If it's the order that we joined SEES, shouldn't yours and mine be reversed?
Maybe it's kinda random? I mean, there's no number two...

Yukari Takeba
Okay.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Them again, of course...
Angry - Fine. Bring it on. We're not gonna lose!

Yukari Takeba
They can try to stop us all they want, but it's not gonna work. Our goal is too important...
So let's go get this over with, all right?

Yukari Takeba
That... Honestly, that sucked, but... let's just keep going.

Yukari Takeba
We have to stay focused.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - I really don't get how they can think the way they do.
Angry - But whatever the reason, they're serious about it, so we'll have to be even more serious.

Yukari Takeba
Let's deal with this quickly. Our real enemy is still ahead, after all.
I'm ready to go when you are.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - This is finally it. The place Ryoji-kun was talking about...
Angry - ...I'm ready. Let's go.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I have so many things running through my mind right now...
Happy - But, most of all, that we're definitely going to win this. Right?

Yukari Takeba
Okay, are you ready?

Yukari Takeba
This is really it, huh...?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - This place is so creepy...
But we have to do this... So let's just do it.

Yukari Takeba
I'm going, no matter what.

Yukari Takeba
No, I'm not sitting on the sidelines today. I'm going!

Yukari Takeba
So much has happened, but this is finally it...
All right, I'm ready when you are.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Tartarus, right? C'mon, let's get going!
Angry - I'm ready whenever.

Yukari Takeba
I didn't even know there were cables underground here. Well, you learn something new every day...

Yukari Takeba
Amada-kun isn't here either... I wonder what happened...
Uh, sorry. I'm ready when you are.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I honestly have no sympathy for those two, but still...
Angry - Sorry, this is no time for that. Let's put an end to this.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Yeah, let's go.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Let's put everything we have into this!
Angry - Ready, Leader?

Yukari Takeba
Looks like we'll have to go through those two first...
Hey, you ready to go?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I can't believe he just took off like that...
Angry - C'mon, we have to go after him.

Yukari Takeba
How each battle goes is gonna depend on your orders, Leader.
So don't be afraid to boss us around.

Yukari Takeba
That Shadow on the monorail was way tougher than any other Shadow we've fought, huh?
Sad - I hope we don't run into any more like that...

Yukari Takeba
It's great having Sanada-senpai back.
He can help make up for how much a certain someone else drags us down.

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Ghost stories are obviously made up. Junpei's just being stupid, as usual.
Angry - For one thing, ghosts definitely aren't real.

Yukari Takeba
I never would've thought it'd all turn out to be something like this...
This is no time to be making stupid jokes like that "Believe It, or Don't" stuff...

Now that Fuuka's handling support, Kirijo-senpai can fight again...
That means we have more options for new battle strategies and stuff, so that's good.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - It seems like Fuuka's getting used to this! That's a relief, huh? So let's keep doing our job well, too.

Yukari Takeba
It's summer, but it doesn't seem like what season it is affects Tartarus at all...
Actually, it'd probably kinda suck if it got hot and cold in Tartarus too.

Yukari Takeba
Did you see how excited Junpei was?
Sad - I hope he doesn't get carried away in Yakushima and do something even dumber than usual...

Yukari Takeba
An "anti-Shadow weapon," huh...?
I gotta say, Aigis isn't exactly what I would've expected an "anti-Shadow weapon" to look like.
A human-looking weapon's kinda weird, but she seems like she'll be a strong ally, so I'm all for it.

Yukari Takeba
Amada-kun's really mature for his age.
I can definitely think of someone who could learn a thing or two from him.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Now we're gonna have Tartarus at night and summer school during the day...
Sad - Going to Tartarus is already tiring enough even when I don't do anything during the day...

Yukari Takeba
I wonder who those Strega guys are...
They even knew about Tartarus... We better be careful about them.

Yukari Takeba
We're almost done with August.
Summer break's almost over, but it doesn't seem like we're anywhere near done with Tartarus...
Well, let's just keep doing the best we can.

Yukari Takeba
I can't believe Amada-kun's gonna be fighting with us now...
I don't really know how I feel about this, but he volunteered himself, so...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Sanada-senpai looks so happy now that Aragaki-senpai's back.
Happy - It seems like he trusts Aragaki-senpai a lot.

Yukari Takeba
That Chidori girl is so... What word am I looking for...? "Mysterious," I guess?
I hope we can get a lot out of her, but I kinda doubt that's gonna happen any time soon...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I'm gonna give it all I've got to make sure I'm totally ready for the next operation!
Happy - Let's all do our best today!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I know Aragaki-senpai's gone, but I think part of me still hasn't totally accepted that yet...
Sad - *sigh* And I know I can't just keep feeling like this forever, but...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Finally, the next Shadow's the last one!
So let's get as strong as we can right now to make sure we win.

Yukari Takeba
It wasn't that long ago that I thought we'd never have to come here again...
Why did this have to happen...?

Yukari Takeba
I wonder if Kirijo-senpai will be okay...
Believe me, I know how she feels, but at least when we're fighting...
I don't mean to sound cold, but it'd be dangerous for all of us if one of us couldn't fight properly.

Yukari Takeba
Maybe I won't heal you in battle anymore, as punishment for peeping...
Happy - I'm just kidding. That would be pretty bad, wouldn't it?
Happy - Besides, you're never gonna do anything like that ever again, right? Right!?

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Me and Mitsuru-senpai have decided that we're going to keep fighting.
Happy - We're both gonna do our best, so let's all do our best.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I don't think I've ever seen Junpei so sad before...
Sad - Knowing that you're only alive because someone you love sacrificed their self for you...?
Sad - I can't even imagine how that must feel...

Yukari Takeba
I keep thinking about everything Ryoji-kun said, and I get so anxious...
I can focus when I'm fighting, but once the battle's over, I start thinking about it again.
I know I've gotta snap out of this, but my brain doesn't seem like it's gonna let me...

Yukari Takeba
Well, not that I expected anything different, but Tartarus isn't exactly in the Christmas spirit.
Happy - But it doesn't matter. I can be happy anywhere as long as I'm with—

Happy - Oh, um, uhh...
Happy - Hahaha! I almost said something really embarrassing.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Now that Aigis is back safe, we can all put everything we've got into fighting again!
I bet this month is gonna fly by in no time...
So let's get as strong as we can.

Yukari Takeba
We're getting close to the day of the fight...
I know it'll be scary, but let's stay calm when we face Nyx and not chicken out or anything, okay?
Actually, what am I telling you for? I should be more worried about Junpei...

Yukari Takeba
I'm actually not as nervous as I thought I'd be. It just feels like, "It's finally here," y'know?
Happy - Well, I guess it has been a whole month. And it'd be a little late to get cold feet now, right?
Happy - All right, Arisato-kun, I'll be counting on you tonight, just like always!

Yukari Takeba
Exploring Tartarus before exams is the worst...
I get so tired after coming here that I can't study. I just fall asleep on my notes.
*sigh* I know there isn't really anything we can do about it, but still...

Yukari Takeba
Even just being inside Tartarus is exhausting for some reason, isn't it?
Do you think it's 'cause we're getting a workout, doing all this?
Well, I guess it doesn't matter. I was just curious.

Yukari Takeba
You know when you hit an enemy's weak point and they fall down?
Some of them look so funny like that, it almost makes me wanna laugh.
But it wouldn't be so funny if we got attacked while we were laughing, huh?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Hey! You're standing too close!
Um, back up a little. My face gets all red when you're that close...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Haha, it's kinda funny seeing you again so soon since we were just hanging out.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I'm feeling great today! C'mon, let's get moving!

Happy - Just be careful. Well, you better be off.

Shuji Ikutsuki
Happy - The day I've been waiting for has finally come.
Happy - I'll leave the rest to you all. A new future is upon us...

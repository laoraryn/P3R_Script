Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Shadow eliminated! Good work!

Fuuka Yamagishi
There might be a treasure chest up ahead, but I sense an enemy presence there, too.
If you're worn out from battling, don't push yourself too hard. Take some time to recuperate.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - It looks as though you've defeated all of the Shadows in this area.
Happy - All we have to do now is open that treasure chest. Let's do it!

Minato Arisato - Selection

Fuuka Yamagishi
Understood.
Please be careful. It's easy to get lost here.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Understood. I'll continue to provide support.
If it gets dangerous, don't hesitate to retreat.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - ...Was I the only one who thought this would be easy? 'Cause it definitely wasn't, and that kinda caught me off-guard.
Well, guess I know better than to judge a book by its cover now. Next time I'll be more careful.
Happy - Looks like there's more up ahead, so let's check it out.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Phew... Glad that's over. Thought it'd be a cinch, but boy was I wrong.
Happy - Tryin' to catch us off-guard, eh? But it'll take more than that to bring us down.
Happy - Anyways, there's treasure up ahead, right? C'mon, let's go grab our loot!

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - That fight was tougher than I thought it'd be.
Happy - Maybe the enemy tried to pull one over on us by pretending to be weak? Not that dirty tricks like that would work.
There's still more up ahead. Let's keep moving.

Mitsuru Kirijo
That was quite a powerful enemy... Or perhaps I was simply underestimating its strength.
In which case, I apologize. I should've known better than to assume, especially since it'll be our lives at risk.
Let's stay focused and keep moving.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Shadow eliminated! Great job, everyone!
It looked like any other Shadow we've encountered, but it was actually a lot stronger, wasn't it...?
Let's brace ourselves in case something like this happens again and proceed with caution.

Akihiko Sanada
Seems like Shadows with different affinities are banding together. They even brought their own support.
If they're working together as a team, then things could get dicey.
But I suppose this proves that teamwork significantly increases a group's combat power.
Happy - So we'll be counting on you, Leader.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Just now... each Shadow had a designated role, and their actions were all well-coordinated.
A team where individuals can cover each other's weaknesses can be formidable, but at least we emerged victorious.
Happy - This was all because we have a particularly exceptional leader. I'll be counting on you for the next battle as well.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Those Shadows just now... Each of them had a unique set of abilities, which made them a really balanced team.
If Shadows are going to be working together from here on out, we'll need to be extra careful.
But if we can figure out what tactics they're using, then maybe we can exploit their weaknesses.
Happy - I'll stay on top of the analysis, so I'm counting on you to make the calls, Leader.

Aigis
The team we fought just now was comprised of Shadows, each one with an ability they exceled at.
For instance, I excel at eliminating enemies with my firearms.
...Though you may already be aware of that. At any rate, let us continue onward.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'm not sure if it's just coincidence, but that enemy resembled a die...
Did it have a set course of action depending on the roll? Like, each number is tied to a specific action?
Exasperated* - If that is the case, then that's pretty risky. I can't imagine leaving everything to chance like that.
Happy - But I guess everyone could use a little luck sometimes. I wish you all the best of luck in your next battle as well.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Exasperated* - Another dice enemy... And when this one rolled let's say a four, for example, it...
Um, I'm complicating things... It just used different attacks from the other one. But maybe there was a pattern to its behavior...
The next enemy might not necessarily be another dice one, though. But keep in mind that some enemies may have patterns.
Shall we keep going?

Yukari Takeba
I was too occupied with fighting that thing to even notice at first, but is there really some kinda pattern with the dice roll...?
Happy - Oh well, we won in the end, so clearly luck's on our side.
Surprised - Who knows? Maybe we'll get really lucky and hit the jackpot with the treasure chest up ahead.
Exasperated* - Or maybe not. Anyway, let's go check it out.

Junpei Iori
To be honest, I wasn't really paying attention, but did the dice roll actually do anything?
Happy - Does it even matter? We won! So I guess we were just stronger and luckier than them!
Surprised - Wait a sec... Does that mean we'll hit the jackpot big time when we pop open the treasure chest!?
Happy - Oh dude, what if gold and gems start pouring out!? We'd be rich! Set for life! C'mon, let's check it out!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Looks like the dice roll had something to do with the attacks.
If luck is a decisive factor in battle, then how would you go about improving your luck...?

Koromaru
Arf, arf! Arf!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Oh, I think Koro-chan is telling us to pray at the shrine.
Happy - Heehee, you might be right, Koro-chan. We should swing by the shrine when we go on walks.

Koromaru
Happy - Arf!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Getting poisoned is scary... It continuously depletes your health.
Make sure you always have some way to cure it whenever you explore Tartarus.
Happy - But on the flip side, it could be a potent strategy against our enemies. You should try using it when you get the chance.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Enemy annihilated. Great work!
Exasperated* - It's kind of unfair how the enemy could drain your energy... Even though we won, this could affect our progress.
We can expect to encounter another powerful enemy up ahead. If you think fighting might be too risky, then I suggest retreating.

Akihiko Sanada
That was one powerful enemy, but there's no way I'll lose in a test of strength.
The Shadow with the feminine figure showed us no mercy though. It kinda reminded me of Mi—

Exasperated* - Never mind. I value my life too much to say any more.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Good work. You managed to take down that powerful Shadow.
By the way, just a random thought I had, but that chair the Shadow was on...
How did it float in the air? Was there some kind of jet attached? Or an anti-gravity device? But what would it use as fuel...?
Surprised - Oh! Sorry. It was just bugging me, that's all.
Surprised - A-Anyway, I'm just glad you were able to beat it. Let's go take a look at the treasure chest.

Aigis
That Shadow took the form of what I assume to be the "Holy Mother"...
Perhaps every mother in this world is capable of executing such powerful, devastating attacks.
I comprehend... I shall exercise caution so that I may never anger one.

Aigis
Sad - That Shadow took the form of what I assume to be the "Holy Mother"...
Perhaps every mother in this world holds the same devastating power.
I now understand why mothers are comparable to bears. They must become terribly ferocious when poked.

Shinjiro Aragaki
Dunno if these Shadows have a gender or whatever, but that one packed a punch.
Anyway, never piss off a woman. Especially Ki—

I didn't phrase that right. Forget it, let's move.
Angry - Seriously. Just... forget about it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
A monster with a human body and a bull's head, trapped within a labyrinth...
As if it were some mythological creature... One with terrifying strength, too.
Happy - But you were able to beat it! That's incredible.
Happy - Keep up the good work.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Black and white castles... Aren't there similar pieces in chess?
Exasperated* - But black and white would be on opposing sides in chess... Why would they team up?
Happy - Well, regardless, you were able to checkmate them easily. Let's keep moving.

Mitsuru Kirijo
The opponents just now... Do you remember them? We've defeated them before.
They're much tougher to beat when they're together.
Happy - ...Though I suppose the same could be said about us. It's a good reminder that teamwork is important.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Do you remember those enemies? We've beaten them before.
It seems like their strength grows exponentially when they team up. It's not as simple as adding one plus one...
Happy - It feels weird to take a hint from a Shadow, but we should make sure our teamwork is just as solid.

Ken Amada
Happy - That knight we fought just now... It looked pretty cool, didn't it?
Happy - Kinda like one from a fairytale. You know, where a knight gallantly saves a princess from an evil dragon?
Well, that's just a bedtime story for little kids. Not like there's a princess I wanna save or anything...
Surprised - I-I really don't, okay? C-C'mon, let's keep moving!

Koromaru
Arf, arf!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Good job, Koro-chan! How about a treat?
That Shadow you just fought was on horseback, right? I hear horses like carrots...
Happy - Why don't I make carrots mixed with rice for this occasion? Maybe I should leave the carrots raw to give them some texture...

Koromaru
*whine*

Fuuka Yamagishi
It looked like that one Shadow had a bunch of underlings this time.
The four of them gave up their lives to protect the snake-like Shadow...
Exasperated* - I wonder why they'd be willing to sacrifice themselves... Makes you think a little.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - A lot of Shadows are really similar... How many variations does that one Shadow even have?
Angry - Ugh, this is so confusing... Why don't we just pull off the plates and paint them all the same color?
Exasperated* - Wait, that won't solve anything... Oh god, I'm losing my mind.

Junpei Iori
You know those Shadows that look like scales? I get confused tryna keep track of 'em.
Happy - Okay, question: what color plates did the last one have?
Surprised - Black, right...? Wait, no, hold up. The body was black... Right?
Sad - Er, Minato, do you remember?

Akihiko Sanada
Those Shadows look unbalanced, but remain upright. It's like they don't wanna go down—not without a fight.
Incidentally, when boxers weigh in, they usually use mechanical scales rather than digital ones.
Happy - Not because of tradition or anything. If you're interested, try looking it up.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Don't you get kinda tempted to put stuff on the plates? See if those scales actually work?
Happy - I mean, those Shadows looked pretty sturdy, so maybe Yukari-chan and I could get on and—

Surprised - A-Actually, never mind! Bad idea. That might reveal a little too much information...

Fuuka Yamagishi
That was such a creepy Shadow. Thank goodness you managed to beat it.
Sad - I don't really believe in ghosts or anything, but if something like that showed up at night...
Exasperated* - ...Then again, now that we've actually defeated it, I don't think I'd be as scared. Kinda weird how I'm unfazed by these things now.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Five of them appeared all at once this time. Were they supposed to be... What is it called...? "Featherman"?
Happy - I know they star in their own TV show... The Kirijo Group has sponsored them before, if I remember correctly.
Happy - Hm... Do they ever ride motorbikes? Or perhaps that was a different show...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Five individuals, each with different colors, working together as a team... Kind of like those Featherman shows for kids.
Happy - Oh, maybe I shouldn't say they're just for kids. I hear they're actually very well done and enjoyed by people of all ages.
Happy - It could be fun if each of us chose a different color to wear. I guess you'd be red since you're the leader, Arisato-kun.
Happy - I should ask Amada-kun about it. He seems to know a lot about Featherman.

Aigis
...The battle has already concluded? Strange. These results contradict pre-existing data.
When fighting a group of five colorful opponents, there is another battle phase where we grow to gargantuan sizes.
Angry - Or perhaps we were supposed to pilot a giant robot...? I must review my data when I have the time.

Ken Amada
Gold, silver, black, white, and pink... That's a rare combination.
Sad - Would they be called... the Tartarangers? Er, no, that sounds kinda lame...
Surprised - Wha—!?
Surprised - O-Oh, nothing! I-I wasn't thinking about Featherman or anything dumb like that! C-C'mon, let's keep going!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - It feels unfair that it could get in so many shots at once...
Sad - But I guess we shouldn't expect the enemy to fight fair and square. They're doing all they can to take us down...
Angry - We can't let them have their way, so you've got my full support!

Fuuka Yamagishi
That was tough... The sight of four samurai in full armor is really intimidating.
Did you spot the slight variations in their helms? Maybe Mr. Ono knows why they're different, since history's his field and all.
Exasperated* - Then again, he might just go on and on and on... until the Shadows would eventually die from boredom.
Angry - Well... Let's keep going. There's still another powerful Shadow up ahead.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - That was the toughest battle yet... But we won!
Happy - Who would've thought we'd be able to take down something like that way back when...?
Exasperated* - Oh, it was obvious how scared I was at the start? Well, maybe you just have nerves of steel...
Happy - Anyway, we've managed to make it this far, so let's keep fighting till the very end.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Awww yeah! We gave one massive ass-whoopin' tonight!
Happy - Nothing beats the power of friendship! The bond we all share is stronger than anything—

Sad - Huh? Who am I to talk? Er, yeah, I guess you got a point there... Especially after all the trouble I caused.
Scheming - But I'm gonna make it up to you! Just you watch! Junpei Iori's gonna hit that grand slam homer!
Surprised - Oh, c'mon, dude... Would it kill ya to say somethin'? Like "I'm countin' on you, bro"?

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - And... KO!
Happy - This might've been the toughest Shadow we've faced yet.
Happy - Not a bad warmup before our final match, don't you think?
It's almost over... This time, we're the challengers, so let's keep up the momentum.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - A flawless victory.
I never imagined that we would get this far, never mind defeat an enemy this powerful...
A year ago, I would've thought it impossible. Honestly, I'm astounded by my own personal progress...
Happy - This is all because of our impeccable teamwork. I really appreciate all that you've done.
And I promise to do all that I can up to the very end, so I ask that you lend me your strength until then.

Fuuka Yamagishi
That last Shadow was just as powerful— No, even more powerful than the large Shadows we faced every month.
We've fought so many of them now...
Happy - But you all come out of every battle stronger. It never ceases to amaze me.
Happy - Watching everyone fight motivated me to improve myself. Thank you for inspiring me.
Surprised - Er... I guess it's a little too early to say something like that though. What I mean to say is...
Happy - Let's keep pressing forward, fighting hard all the way until the end!

Aigis
We have won.
...I was designed to be a weapon. The reason I exist is to destroy Shadows.
Sad - That's something that won't ever change, but that's not my only purpose now...
Happy - It's difficult to put into words, but I wish to stay by everyone's side—by your side, Minato-san.
Happy - And that is why I'll continue to fight.

Ken Amada
Happy - Sure, it looked like a giant monster, but I wasn't worried we'd lose—not even for a second!
Happy - There's no way it was stronger than the final enemy. If we couldn't even beat that thing, we wouldn't stand a chance.
Angry - Not that I'm underestimating the enemy or anything. I just feel like... I gotta be brave.
Angry - Because I don't want to let anyone down. Not you... Not him either.
Happy - So we have to keep fighting!

Koromaru
Awoooooo!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Koro-chan looks ready for anything. It's easy to tell.
Happy - I might not understand him as well as Aigis, but I picked up a few things from all the time we've spent together.
Happy - Koro-chan says he's counting on you, Arisato-kun. Let's fight together, to the very end.

Koromaru
Arf! Arf!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Oh, it looks like there's a door up ahead. Aigis, could you give it a look?
I don't think it's dangerous. It should just transport you somewhere.

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
This door... I wonder where it leads.

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
Very happy* - Uh-huh, that's right, **Junpei and Koromaru have rejoined the party!

Koromaru
Happy - **Woof! Woof!

Junpei Iori
Happy - I'd say that's mission accomplished, yeah? Nothin' to it! Just leave the explorin' to us!

Akihiko Sanada
But it was Aigis who found the supply route, not you.

Junpei Iori
Exasperated* - Yep, you sure did good, Junpei!

===============================================================================================

Aigis - Thoughts
The Shadow dropped some sort
of object. I'm not sure what it is...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Could you show that to me back at the dorm? I'd like to take a closer look.
I'm not completely sure yet, but I get the feeling it might be useful.
Happy - Thanks, Aigis.

===============================================================================================

Mitsuru Kirijo
...All right.
I've concluded my own investigation.
Yamagishi will pick up the search from here.
From this point on, **I'll be joining the main expedition** with all of you.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - It looks like the whole team can focus on exploring now.

Mitsuru Kirijo
If you need my help, don't hesitate to call for me.

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - You can do it! I know you can!

===============================================================================================

Metis
By the way, I've been wondering...
What's in the room all the way down the hall on the second floor?
I get the strangest feeling when I stand in front of it. Could it be...?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Down the hall on the second floor... Do you mean his room?

Yukari Takeba
Angry - ...The upper floors are none of your business. Quit being so nosy.

Metis
Sad - You don't have to get so mad...

Yukari Takeba
Well, our job right now is to explore this place... So come on, let's go.

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - Incoming enemy Shadow!

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, by the way, Aigis...
You've encountered a human-like figure a couple of times in the Abyss, right? Did you sense anything peculiar about it?
All I could tell through Juno was that it seemed to be another person...

Metis
"Another person"? No way, that's impossible. We were the only ones down there.

Akihiko Sanada
We can talk till we're blue in the face about it. Won't make a difference.
As long as it keeps showing itself, we'll catch it. You can bet on that—and that's really all there is to it.

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - Incoming enemy Shadow!

===============================================================================================

Ken Amada
There were seven doors in the Desert at the start... meaning we have to clear seven different areas.
I used to think this would take forever, but now there are only two doors left.

Akihiko Sanada
Yeah... We're nearly there.
Happy - Now's the time to step it up, guys. Let's press on!

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - You can do it! I know you can!

===============================================================================================

Junpei Iori
We're comin' up on our last shot...
Happy - This is it, guys. We're finally gonna get to the bottom of all this.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Supposedly, it has to do with us and our Personas...
Sad - You don't think that the only way out of this... is for us to die... do you?

Akihiko Sanada
Thinking like that gets you nowhere.
We only got this far because we believed there'd be another way.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Y-You're right... Sorry, I'm going back to my bad habits again.

Mitsuru Kirijo
We won't have to endure this for much longer. Everyone, brace yourselves. We're going in.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I wonder if Kirijo-senpai and the others are okay...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I-It won't come in through the window, right...?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Sorry, I know this is sudden and you were sleeping... I promise I'll explain later.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Wait, are you trying to escape from the window...? You can't do that!

Yukari Takeba
That wouldn't work after all...

Yukari Takeba
Mm, this won't work...
If we stay here, we'll...

Yukari Takeba
Let's get out of here...
Please...!

Yukari Takeba
This isn't an evacuation drill, you know...
If we don't get out of here, we're going to die!

Yukari Takeba
I-It doesn't seem like it's going to be over anytime soon...

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Staying in one room probably won't help. We need to go somewhere else...!

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Don't worry, there's no one left! Let's just get out of here!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - I'm not joking, we're in danger! We gotta hurry and run!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I wonder if the others are okay...
No, I'm sure they'll do something about this. We need to focus on getting away!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - We don't have time to go back! Let's go!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - That's not going to work right now. Please, can you leave that for later?

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I wonder what Kirijo-senpai and the others are gonna do...
Angry - Anyway, it's dangerous here too, so we need to hurry and run!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - If it comes down to it, I... I'll...
...Sorry, it's nothing. Let's hurry and keep going.

Yukari Takeba

Yukari Takeba
No time to waste. We need to hurry and get somewhere safe...

Yukari Takeba
Don't worry. I'm sure everything will work out...
C'mon, let's hurry and get away!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - You can enjoy all the drinks you want later, so please... We have to go right now, okay?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Wait, it's dangerous that way! We need to head up!

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - It won't do any good to head back! We don't know what's going on down there!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - What's wrong? We can't stay here!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - I know you want to go see what's happening... but I'm not joking about how dangerous it is down there.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Whoa, what the...!?
Surprised - H-Hurry! We have to go higher!

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - H-How is this possible...!?
Angry - Hurry, we need to hurry up...!

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Please, let's just hurry upstairs, okay?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - That's not going to turn on... Please, let's hurry away from here, okay?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Not that way! Umm... It's dangerous outside!

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - You can do that later! We need to get away, fast!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Now's not the time for that!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - This isn't an evacuation drill! It won't be written on the schedule.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - There's no power going to that right now... You can check it out another time!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - That won't open! Hurry!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Please, you can read any other time!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Now's not the time to be reading!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - It's dangerous to be near the shelves... They might topple onto you.

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Things might fall over, so let's not stand here, okay?

Yukari Takeba
Angry - C'mon... Now's not the time for letters.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Uh, well... Um... Can you hold it in for now?

Yukari Takeba
Angry - What's wrong? We need to hurry and run!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - All right, let's get away upstairs.

Minato Arisato - Selection
Let's hurry.
Good idea.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Huh? Now's not the time for that...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I should get back to where Yukari is...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
There's no need to change right now...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I wonder if I'll make it to
tomorrow in one piece...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I'm completely awake now...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The TV isn't turning on...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The desk is straightened...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's a bit chilly...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I see a tired face in the reflection...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The fridge's power is out...

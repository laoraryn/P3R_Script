Minato Arisato - Selection
I'm ready.
Hold on.

Yukari Takeba
What are you doing? C'mon, hurry up and choose a party.

Junpei Iori
Dude, what're you doin'? Choose some party members already!

Mitsuru Kirijo
What exactly are you doing?
We don't have time to waste. Please decide who will be going with you.

Akihiko Sanada
Hey, where do you think you're going?
We have to get out of here as soon as we can, so hurry up and pick who's going.

Fuuka Yamagishi
It's dangerous to fight with such a small group. You should bring more people with you.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Are you ready?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Okay, I'll get ready to provide support, then. Please head on over.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Many encyclopedia
volumes are lined up here.
There are also star charts
and books on geology.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
There are many files labeled,
"Shadow Appearance Dates."
They are stamped with
"Do Not Remove" labels.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The titles contain many esoteric
terms that I can't understand...
They seem to have to do with
psychology and psychoanalysis.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's a bank of consoles.
There are others in the room right now,
so I shouldn't watch the videos...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's a bank of consoles.
A surveillance camera seems to have
turned itself on and recorded a video...
But there are others in the room right
now, so I shouldn't watch it...

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yes
No

Aigis
Please decide who will be joining you in battle.

Ken Amada
Is something wrong?
Um... Please decide who's going.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Okay, let's go.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Well then, we're off.

Shuji Ikutsuki
All right. Be careful.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Let's go!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The door is tightly sealed. I wonder
if it's a storage room...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
There are all kinds of
decorations on the shelf.
On either side are pictures of a
woman and a stern-looking man...
I wonder who they are...

===============================================================================================



Fuuka Yamagishi
I sense the target two blocks ahead of you!
It seems to be moving slowly downward.
Don't let it get away!

Fuuka Yamagishi
This place...
It seems it was some kind of armory during the war.
I've never seen so many weapons lying around before.
They were all designed to kill people...
Having to kill others to survive...
It's hard to believe a time like that is part of our history.

Fuuka Yamagishi
The target's gaining speed! It's continuing down the tunnel!
Hurry and chase it down!

Fuuka Yamagishi
The target's stopped!
It turned around! It's waiting for us one block down!
Please be careful!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - It's too dangerous to go without more people!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
The door's too heavy to open.
I think we're trapped...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
...That skeleton used to be somebody.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
There are cobwebs
stretching over the boxes...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Looks like canned food.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Tables and boxes clutter the room...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - The target's up ahead!
Angry - Are you ready?

Minato Arisato - Selection
Yes, I'm ready.
Hold on.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
There's a diary next to the skeleton's hand.

Diary Text
"We have toiled until our fingers bled in hopes of protecting our country... protecting my family..."
"We've failed."
"But while the temptation to succumb to despair is strong, we cannot afford that luxury."
"The sky may boil crimson, but we shall persevere."

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Stacks of heavy artillery are stored here...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
It's a huge, wheeled cannon.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
These weapon parts look complicated...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Some kind of large disk is resting here...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
There's a skeleton crushed
under the machinery...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
A diary with a desiccated lock
is lying near the skeleton.

Journal Text
"In the hopes that this message will reach my loved ones, I have sealed this journal for its protection."
"We few survivors have ensured the completion of our goal."
"So many of our cohorts will never know our success... I pray their spirits find rest in the wake of this turmoil."
"To my mother, my wife, and my children: please do not think that I have abandoned you."
"If securing your futures means giving my life, then I will have done so happily. Honor my memory by living."

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - I've never seen so many weapons lying around before.
Sad - They were all designed to kill people...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Having to kill others to survive...
Sad - It's hard to believe a time like that is part of our history.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - This place...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - It seems it was some kind of armory during the war.

Aigis
These tread marks... They're new.

Akihiko Sanada
These tracks on the ground seem to be made recently...

Junpei Iori
Huh? Why the hell are there tread marks?

Mitsuru Kirijo
These might belong to our target... Let's keep an eye out.

Mitsuru Kirijo
These could belong to the target... Stay alert, everyone.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
What's that on the ground...?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
I haven't seen anything like this before...
I should hold onto it for now.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
Something's on the desk.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
...?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts
...What are all these documents?

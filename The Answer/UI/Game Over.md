Aigis - Thoughts   
For as long as life exists, so too shall death.   
The flame of life burns bright,   
stoked by pain and hardship.   
Now with the light of life snuffed out,   
    the clock has come to a stop.   
What is the meaning of life?   
Alas, the answer shall remain forever out of grasp...

Junpei Iori   
Happy - Kinda worried about what could happen in there, but Koromaru and I will go check things out!   
Happy - Leave finding supplies to us! You just concentrate on exploring, Ai-chan.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Huh... Didn't expect to end up here.   
Happy - Guess that solves the starve-to-death problem we had, though!   
Happy - Koromaru and I are finally back to exploring with you guys!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Who woulda thought we'd be back at it again with this endless exploration? I'll just do what I do best!   
Happy - No slacking off for me. Don't want to cause trouble for our leader Ai-chan!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Say, Ai-chan.   
Has Yuka-tan been kinda... gloomy lately? Or is it just me?   
   
top - SEL_018_0_0   
Yes, she has.   
It must be your imagination.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Right?   
Sad - But what can we do? I guess we should keep an eye on her...   
Exasperated* - It's so hard to understand what a girl's thinking, especially Yuka-tan.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Oh. Uh, really? Was my read on her that bad...?   
I mean, she looks all normal and stuff, but I can't shake the feeling there's something a little off...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Back then, when I stood here, I used to question whether or not I actually wanted to go exploring.   
Exasperated* - Exploring for days in a row is no joke. If you asked me back then, I'd scream and run away.   
Surprised - Wait... If the same day is repeating, does this even count as going multiple days in a row?   
   
Junpei Iori   
So... that was Sanada-san before high school, and I'm a year younger than him... Wait, he was a third-year in middle school then!?   
Surprised - It had been barely half a year since I transferred! And he was fightin' Shadows already?   
Surprised - Damn, that's badass. Don't you think, Koromaru? The will to fight was coursing through his veins back then, too!   
Happy - In any case, we, the Daring Duo, are ready to join the exploration whenever you need us!   
   
Junpei Iori   
My dad's gotten better since then, but he's still... Well, he ain't exactly the most upstanding citizen.   
Happy - Aaagh, that's enough of that! And don't feel like you have to make me feel better or anything.   
Very happy* - Besides, I think what's going on right now is way more important! So to get us out of this...   
Happy - Your best option is to bring me, the Great Junpei Iori! I'll get us out of this!   
   
Junpei Iori   
So, with those freaky doors that show the past, we've seen Amada, Sanada-san, me and Koromaru, and Kirijo-senpai.   
And if we're the reason this thing exists, then I wonder if there's a door for each of us. That means there's, uh, how many left...?   
Happy - No use thinking about it now. Let's just get in there and open those doors.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - I don't think Metis has some evil plan or anything. But she can be a little difficult to talk to at times...   
Sad - No offense to you, Ai-chan, but what's up with an anti-Shadow weapon that gets all cranky like that?   
Exasperated* - *sigh*   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - I dunno if I can explain this well, but I don't think anybody's right here.   
I mean, even you don't know what to do here. Right, Aigis?   
Sad - That also doesn't sit well with me. That's why... I can't take your side.   
Exasperated* - She said to think about how we feel... So I'm going to do just that.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Now that I've had time to calm down and think... I've realized that li'l sis is just as cute as you, Ai-chan!   
Very happy* - Never really noticed it before. Man, I must have been out of it.   
Happy - That butterfly thing on her face is actually... kinda mysterious and irresistible, y'know?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Really glad things didn't end with li'l sis in tears.   
Sad - I know it's a bit late coming from me now, but if you died there, Aigis...   
Exasperated* - Or even worse, if I was the one to take the key from you...   
Exasperated* - ......   
Very angry* - That would have been the worst friggin' thing to live with! Let's never do something like that again!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oh, Ai-chan. You free at all? Wanna do something fun?   
Happy - Check out this ! Let's see if we can learn a thing or two from what we found in the Abyss of Time!   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
Should I spend time with Junpei-san?   
   
top - SEL_049_5_0   
I think I will.   
Not now.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Very happy* - That's the spirit!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Alright then. Well, if you have some time, feel free to drop by.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oh, Ai-chan. You free at all? Wanna do something fun?   
I'm actually not so sure I can do this on my own... You think you could help me out?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Thanks! You're a lifesaver!   
Happy - We found this  in the Abyss of Time, right? So I wanted to try cooking.   
Very happy* - Never cooked in my life, but I think it'll be fine! Let's head to the kitchen pronto!

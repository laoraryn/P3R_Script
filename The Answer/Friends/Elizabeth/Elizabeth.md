Elizabeth   
I apologize for asking you to come on such short notice.   
   
Elizabeth   
......   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - Oh, how rude of me! I seem to be distracted, despite requesting your presence in the first place.   
   
Elizabeth   
Now then, seeing as you have awakened to your new power and begun exploring, I have something of a proposal for you.   
I happen to have a certain matter on my mind, you see.   
Sad - However, it is a matter for which I have yet to find a solution. It has me feeling rather stumped. Quite perplexed. Positively discombobulated.   
Therefore... Should you allow it, I would like to observe those newfound abilities of yours.   
I ask that you fulfill my requests. I believe doing so would prove to be an adequate demonstration of your power.   
Naturally, you will be rewarded upon the completion of any such tasks.   
   
Elizabeth   
......   
   
Elizabeth   
Well, that concludes the detailing of my proposal.   
Happy - I am... very much looking forward to witnessing you utilize the fullest extent of your power.   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
It seems I can now choose to   
accept Elizabeth-san's requests.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Elizabeth   
...And with that, all requests have been marked completed.   
Which means you will not receive any more requests from me.   
I am satisfied, having witnessed the power you displayed.   
......   
   
Elizabeth   
Sad - It appears I am still quite distracted. I apologize.   
Sad - I have still yet to discover a solution to that certain matter... Could it be that there is no solution? Or perhaps...   
   
Elizabeth   
Well, it is much too early to draw such conclusions. I shall see your journey to its end first.   
You have my utmost gratitude for all of your efforts to appease me.   
   
Elizabeth   
Hm... I feel as though I am on the verge of a revelation of sorts...   
The vastness of your abilities has shown me great potential...   
As for this certain matter...   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - ......   
   
Elizabeth   
I'm afraid I cannot wholly put it into words as of yet, but suffice it to say that I may have glimpsed a faint ray of hope.   
Now, I shall continue to assist you as you make evermore progress on your journey.   
You have my utmost gratitude for all of your efforts to appease me.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
There's something in my hand...   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
It feels warm...

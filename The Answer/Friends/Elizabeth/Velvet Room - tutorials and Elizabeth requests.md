Welcome to the Velvet Room.   
Sad - ......   
Sad - It would appear that, despite his absence, you...   
Surprised - Hm... Pay me no mind.   
How may I help you?   
   
Elizabeth   
Welcome to the Velvet Room.   
......   
Would you care to hear me sing?   
Veeelvet, oh veeelvet. My master has a looong nooose!   
Happy - There. Surely, you now find yourself more at ease.   
Keep in mind that you cannot simply rush your way through such tribulations as these. Please, go forth at your own pace.   
How may I help you?   
   
Elizabeth   
Welcome to the Velvet Room.   
Have you begun to sense the impending end of your journey?   
Just what is it that you will find there...? I look forward to seeing it myself.   
How may I help you?   
   
Elizabeth   
Welcome to the Velvet Room.   
Sad - Alas, it seems your trials have still yet to come to an end. I can see the anguish in your eyes.   
Sad - ......   
I believe it quite worthwhile to look inward and reflect on oneself.   
Consider your options, and what they might accomplish. That will surely be illuminating...   
......   
How may I help you?   
   
Elizabeth   
Welcome to the Velvet Room.   
It seems you have reached the final leg of your journey.   
And what determination I see in your eyes... Quite different indeed from your demeanor at the outset.   
Happy - ......   
What will you have to show at your journey's conclusion? What answer will you find...?   
In any case, I do hope that you arrive at your destination safely.

Igor   
My role is to create new Personas...   
By fusing your existing Personas together, a new one shall emerge.   
When a new Persona is created, it tends to be of a higher level than the ones that were fused.   
However, Personas that are fused will be lost.   
Since the process requires multiple Personas, you will be left with fewer in your arsenal than you had before...   
Which powers will you forsake in order to gain new ones...? It is up to you to decide.   
   
Igor   
A Persona is the power of your soul, which thrives on the bonds you have with others.   
Thus, it is only natural that Social Links affect the strength of your Personas.   
If you have established a Social Link of the same Arcana as the Persona you wish to create...   
Then that Persona will receive power from the Social Link and level up.   
The amount of power it will receive depends on the rank of the Social Link.   
In some cases, your Persona may even surpass your own level...   
Do you understand now how important Social Links are to Persona-users?   
   
Igor   
The most basic type of fusion would be merging two Personas together.   
Generally, Persona fusion exhibits predictable patterns depending on the Arcana involved.   
By making good use of this pattern, you will be able to create a Persona of your choosing.   
There are a number of combinations, however, that do not follow convention.   
For example, when fusing Personas of the same Arcana...   
The best way to learn is to experiment on your own.   
   
Igor   
Allow me to briefly explain the Special Fusions that involve three or more Personas.   
These fusions are a tad complex, you see...   
They will only become available once you have obtained specific Personas.   
Though it will take much time and effort, the Personas you can fuse will be well worth it.   
Most importantly, Personas created through these Special Fusions cannot be acquired by any other method...   
That in itself makes the endeavor worthwhile.   
   
Igor   
A new Persona born from fusion may at times be able to inherit skills from the composite ones.   
In other words, it's possible to give a Persona skills that it could never learn on its own.   
You should keep this in mind when attempting to create a powerful Persona.   
The mechanisms of skill inheritance are not yet fully understood... but there are two key points I'd like to share with you.   
First, the more skills the original Personas possess, the more skills the resulting Persona can inherit.   
Second, different Personas have different strengths and weaknesses regardless of the skills they can inherit.   
...Do keep that in mind.   
   
Igor   
Allow me to explain more about skill inheritance.   
For each Persona, there are skills that can be inherited, and those that cannot.   
I believe it will be difficult to inherit skills with affinities that are of the Persona's weakness.   
But some Personas have fewer inheritable attributes than others.   
Even more rare are Personas that can inherit any skill, although they do exist.   
You will learn more, by and by, as you experiment with fusion.   
   
Igor   
Incense Cards have the ability to enhance your Personas' abilities.   
These enhancements can be passed on to new Personas through fusion.   
As for which cards to use and which abilities to enhance...   
You will learn more, by and by, as you experiment with them.   
   
Igor   
I regret to inform you of this, but our powers are not perfect.   
Although rare, there are times when the cards may be incorrectly positioned...   
When this occurs, it may result in an accident.   
The created Persona will most likely be different from what we anticipated.   
Do forgive us if such an incident does occur...   
   
Igor   
Occasionally, a newly created Persona will emerge bearing something within.   
I advise you to nurture it, as it will eventually produce an item that may be of great use to you.   
Using the item without first raising the Persona will do you no good...   
Therein lies hidden power that you may one day wield.   
...Do keep this in mind.   
   
Igor   
Skill Cards let you teach the skills sealed within them to any Persona.   
For example, if you were to use an "Agi" card on a Persona, that Persona would then learn Agi.   
Even if the skill is one that cannot be passed down through fusion, it seems Personas can learn them via Skill Cards...   
Also, if the Persona you wish to teach a skill already has eight skills in its current repertoire...   
You will be able to choose which skill to discard.   
...It would be best for you to learn about that yourself through trial and error.   
   
Elizabeth   
Personas emerge from the sea of your soul... And they are all recorded within the Persona Compendium.   
Once you've obtained a new Persona, it will be automatically registered to the Compendium, no matter the method of acquisition.   
Personas can be summoned from the Compendium at any time once registered, even those that have been released.   
Please note, though, that there will be a fee for summoning a Persona from the Compendium.   
Happy - The stronger the Persona, the more it will cost... Such is the way of the world.   
   
Elizabeth   
You may also re-register a Persona that had already been registered. This will update its records in the Compendium.   
Let us know anytime you want to update the records of a Persona that you have trained.   
...Oh, and no need to worry—there are no fees for registering Personas.   
   
Elizabeth   
Personas are like masks representing your soul. Depending on the time and circumstances, you can freely switch between them.   
Things shall go more smoothly for you if you manage to make the most of your Personas.   
For example, if you bring a Persona of the same Arcana as the Social Link you're meeting...   
I'm sure that they, who don the same mask, will allow for a deeper bond to form.   
Use this information wisely.   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - Oh...   
As those are my personal requests, let us discuss them outside of this room.   
   
Igor   
Search Fusion will allow you to conduct a wide search on which Personas you can fuse.   
With Search Fusion, you will be able to view a list of Personas that you can create from the Personas in your possession.   
This way, you will be able to check and compare different combinations of Personas even if the end result is the same.   
Other than that, you may also find it useful to check Personas that you have yet to encounter.   
I hope you will make good use of it.   
   
Igor   
In rare cases, a Persona's skills may change during fusion.   
Oftentimes, the skills will change to ones of similar level. However, in some cases they may even change to higher level skills...   
Hopefully, luck is on your side and all goes well. I urge you to first give careful consideration before making an attempt.   
   
Igor   
As with all things, there is always a possibility in which the unforeseen may occur.   
The same goes for when we conduct Persona fusions.   
As the number of fusions you have performed grows, so too will the likelihood of an accident coming to pass.   
Do keep this in mind.   
   
Elizabeth   
Please choose what skills to inherit.   
   
Igor   
It looks like you are not yet at a high enough level to create this Persona...   
   
Igor   
You already seem to have that Persona.   
   
Igor   
You have yet to establish a Social Link that corresponds to this Persona...   
   
Igor   
The corresponding Social Link is at level 1. This Persona will receive at least some power from it.   
   
Igor   
The corresponding Social Link is at level 2. This Persona will receive at least some power from it.   
   
Igor   
The corresponding Social Link is at level 3. This Persona will receive a fair amount of power from it.   
   
Igor   
The corresponding Social Link is at level 4. This Persona will receive a fair amount of power from it.   
   
Igor   
The corresponding Social Link is at level 5. This Persona will receive a good degree of power from it.   
   
Igor   
The corresponding Social Link is at level 6. This Persona will receive a good degree of power from it.   
   
Igor   
The corresponding Social Link is at level 7. This Persona will receive considerable power from it.   
   
Igor   
The corresponding Social Link is at level 8. This Persona will receive considerable power from it.   
   
Igor   
The corresponding Social Link is at level 9. This Persona will receive considerable power from it.   
   
Igor   
Hmm... The corresponding Social Link is at level 10.   
Without a doubt, this Persona will receive a tremendous amount of power.   
   
Igor   
Is this Persona acceptable?   
   
top - SEL_CMB_COMFIRM   
Yes.   
Hold on.   
   
Igor   
Oh? It seems the  Social Link has blessed you with even more power...   
   
Igor   
Oh? This Persona seems to be harboring something inside...   
   
Igor   
I'm afraid it did not turn out as we expected...   
   
Igor   
Oh... This is a wild card.

You'll need to summon from the Persona Compendium to continue.   
Summoning fees amount to  yen. Would you like to proceed?   
   
top - SEL_SPCMB_BOOKREAD_COMFI   
Sure.   
Not now.   
   
Igor   
It appears as though you do not possess enough money for that...   
   
Igor   
It appears you are unable to carry any more Personas with you...   
   
Igor   
There aren't any Personas you can fuse...   
   
Elizabeth   
You wish to register all your Personas, correct?   
   
Elizabeth   
The level is lower than it was previously. Are you certain you want to continue with registration?   
   
Elizabeth   
I'll only register the Personas that are at a higher level than before. Is that all right?   
   
Elizabeth   
Do you want to register this Persona to the Compendium?   
   
Elizabeth   
Do you want to register all selected Personas to the Compendium?   
   
Elizabeth   
I have registered its current stats in the Compendium.   
   
Elizabeth   
All of your Personas have been registered.   
   
top - SEL_BOOK_WRITE_OK_UP

Wait...   
   
Elizabeth   
Here is ****, as requested.   
   
Elizabeth   
Unfortunately, you appear to be rather low on funds.   
   
Elizabeth   
It seems you already have this Persona.   
   
Elizabeth   
It seems you cannot add any more Personas to your repertoire.   
   
Elizabeth   
This Persona comes from another, one who suffers a different fate from yours, somewhere out there...   
Their immense power, dwelling within this Persona, will surely be a great boon to you.   
Do you wish to summon it?   
   
Igor   
Oh? This Persona comes from someone who walks a different path from you, somewhere not here.   
It embodies the strength of its original owner's ferocious heart... and will surely become yours.   
   
Elizabeth   
Normally, this Persona is one that exceeds the power you currently possess...   
However, with the blessing of the Sun Arcana, it looks like you will be able to fuse it now.

Elizabeth   
Go ahead and take a look.   
   
Elizabeth   
Is there anything else?   
   
Igor   
Hm...?   
Well, well...   
It seems that you've discovered **every Social Link and formed strong bonds with them all**.   
For you to have possessed this many bonds, you must have donned numerous faces...   
With such an extraordinary propensity for change, perhaps you may be able to harness a greater power.   
The power of infinity...   
Take this with you.   
   
Igor   
I do believe you are now capable of summoning a particular Persona...   
But what Persona shall be born of your bonds...? I look forward to seeing it myself.   
   
Elizabeth   
It's as if your presence emanates a far brighter radiance than before. Perhaps all your hard work is starting to show.   
Here. It may not be much, but this is my gift to you. Please accept it.   
   
Elizabeth   
I can sense that the power growing within you stems from the bonds you have forged and nurtured since.   
Here. It may not be much, but this is my gift to you. Please accept it.   
   
Elizabeth   
Even in the face of tremendous hardship, you continue to make great progress nonetheless.   
This is less of a reward and more of a gift from me to you. Please, take it.   
   
Elizabeth   
I still cannot foresee the limits of your potential... I look forward to witnessing you grow even further.   
   
Elizabeth   
Oh my... You appear to have gained a new power.   
I believe you called it "Theurgy"?   
Now that you've become even stronger...   
You should be able to battle more efficiently and exquisitely with your multiple Personas.   
As you acquire more Personas to fill the Compendium, you'll open your mind to new battle stratagems.   
I shall inform you when more combinations are available in the Persona Compendium.   
   
Elizabeth   
Welcome to the Velvet Room. I have something important to tell you.   
The number of Personas registered in the Compendium has increased significantly.   
Happy - This is proof of all the hard work you've been putting in... It is truly wonderful news.   
So in turn, I would like to offer you more of my help...   
I shall reduce the cost of summoning a Persona from the Compendium. Consider it a little gift from me.   
I hope you make good use of it.   
   
Elizabeth   
Welcome to the Velvet Room. I have something important to tell you.   
The Persona Compendium is now half-filled with registered Personas.   
Surprised - At first glance, it seems like a lot, but to think we're only just halfway...   
Once again, the potential you possess has left me in awe.   
Now, to show my appreciation for all your hard work...   
The cost to summon a Persona from the Compendium will be discounted even further.   
I hope you make good use of it.   
   
Elizabeth   
Welcome to the Velvet Room. I have something important to tell you.   
There are only a few Personas left unregistered in the Persona Compendium.   
To show my appreciation for your hard work...   
The cost to summon a Persona from the Compendium will be greatly discounted.   
To think, this Compendium, once so empty, is now nearly complete...   
Happy - And you might just be the one capable of filling each and every one of these pages.   
...I look forward to that day.   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - Oh? Would you look at that...?   
Surprised - You've managed to fill out the entire Persona Compendium just now.   
Surprised - As a resident of the Velvet Room...   
It brings me much pride and pleasure to witness such a momentous occasion.   
To show my sincerest appreciation for all your hard work...   
The cost to summon a Persona from the Compendium will be lowered as much as possible, so long as my master is amenable.   
You've made it this far, overcoming all odds and obstacles...   
I'm confident you will be able to face whatever fate has in store for you...   
So allow me to assist you till the very end.

At the upper levels of Tartarus—deep, deep within—I sense an immensely malevolent presence...   
This wicked shade prowling within the darkness... Let us call it the **Shadow of the Void**.   
This time, I would like to request that you defeat this "Shadow of the Void."   
While it is a request of considerable difficulty, I shall wait for a report of your success.   
   
Elizabeth   
Let us start with a simple request.   
Please bring me this beverage you call   
"."   
It is not a particularly rare commodity, so you should be able to find and purchase it with ease.   
   
Elizabeth   
I have heard whispers of a certain doll...   
One with an appearance so horrific, it invokes nightmares.   
But, on the other hand, it may also be used as a tool for education.   
Perhaps one exists somewhere within the learning facility you attend... Would you mind searching for it?   
   
Elizabeth   
I understand that there exists a machine in your world that automatically dispenses all kinds of beverages.   
What a strange contraption, is it not? Though I must admit I have a peculiar interest in these beverages...   
Could you gather some for me? Of course, whatever you can get your hands on shall suffice.   
   
Elizabeth   
Word has it that the ultimate drink in your world is something called "aojiru."   
However, the taste is described as "super gross." How intriguing, indeed...   
After all, if I am to drink something, I would like for it to taste good... Therein lies my request.   
Would you please look for a delicious aojiru for me?   
   
Elizabeth   
I hear there exists a research lab called the "nurse's office" within the learning facility you attend.   
Experiments, ranging from the scientific to the supernatural, are conducted there all day and night for the sake of humanity's health.   
Apparently, aside from ordinary medicine, potentially lethal ones are also created there...   
That said... I would like you to negotiate with the master of the nurse's office and bring me that potent medicine.   
   
Elizabeth   
It's said that music can paint a vivid reflection of the culture at that time and place in history.   
Should that prove true, then I wonder if the Gekkoukan High School you attend has its own unique music as well...   
It's been on my mind ever since I first heard of this... So will you do me one favor?   
I'd like to hear a piece of music distinctive to your learning facility, Gekkoukan High School.   
   
Elizabeth   
I hear that this  is, as you humans say, all the rage in town.   
Rumor has it that only enthusiastic freaks are permitted to consume this beef bowl...   
So if possible, could you get your hands on a portion for me as well?   
   
Elizabeth   
Evidently, those who proclaim to be "big eaters" pit themselves against one another in fierce battles.   
One such battle shall be held at the burger establishment at the Iwatodai strip mall...   
As much as I'd like to participate in it myself, I fear I cannot leave my post here for too long...   
Would you take on this "Big Eater Challenge" in my stead?   
   
Elizabeth   
I hear that there is a custom in your world in which a bouquet of flowers is given to a woman.   
I, too, would like to receive such a gift... A bouquet of flowers.   
Therefore, I request that you bring me roses of the deepest crimson. They would stand out brilliantly in our ultramarine-colored world.   
I shall be awaiting the loveliest bouquet of roses from you.   
   
Elizabeth   
Have you ever had your fortune told, Arisato?   
It seems you can find a famous fortune-teller in the club at Paulownia Mall.   
Rumor says for every question you ask, you shall receive an answer that is "right on the money."   
I am greatly interested in the accuracy of this fortune telling.   
Would you please use this person's services so that I may verify the authenticity of them?   
Please ask them to predict **whether or not rare Shadows will appear more often**.   
   
Elizabeth   
The other day, I overheard a housewife say something rather intriguing.   
Within the world of online shopping, these  are extremely popular right now.   
I would love to see what makes these shoes so special... Would you please bring me a pair?   
   
Elizabeth   
Do you recall the online shopping world I spoke of in an earlier request?   
That seems to be related to a strange individual who often rambles along to a unique melody.   
Furthermore, he appears to be quite the prominent figure in your world...   
I've also heard that such prominent figures have a habit of handing out autographs on the streets.   
Since I am unable to leave my post... would you mind fetching me their autograph?   
   
Elizabeth   
I believe there is a sweet, grilled fish called "taiyaki" that is often consumed in your world...   
Apparently, there is also a strange taiyaki that is cold even though it has been grilled.   
I, for one, would love to have a taste. Could you please bring me one?   
   
Elizabeth   
Allegedly, something called a "home-cooked meal," which possesses a special kind of flavor, exists in your world.   
I'm curious what it tastes like... Very much so.   
Could you bring me something with the flavor of this "home-cooked meal"?   
It can be either food or beverage—I've no preference. Well then, I'll be looking forward to it.   
   
Elizabeth   
By the way, I heard a rumor that a potato grown with painstaking love and care will develop a mysterious power.   
I believe you can obtain the proper seeds to grow such potatoes from a shop that deals in plants.   
Would you please grow and nurture a potato to verify the authenticity of these claims?   
   
Elizabeth   
Are you aware of a ritual called the "hundred shrine visits" that supposedly grants wishes?   
I would love to witness the miracle of the gods myself. However, I cannot abandon my duties here...   
So would you please visit the shrine on my behalf?   
As for my wish... 500-yen bills are extremely rare in your world, yes? Then I'd like to wish for one.   
   
Elizabeth   
Angry - I've come across a rumor I cannot dismiss.   
Angry - Apparently, my name is being used somewhere without my knowledge or consent.   
According to the rumor, this beverage is only available in an unpopular spot.   
Please conduct a thorough investigation of this beverage, as it concerns my reputation.

According to my master... the stronger your bonds, the greater your power.   
Though a strong bond is no tangible object... I understand that one can sometimes be represented by a gift.   
Would you please show me an item symbolic of a strong bond?   
   
Elizabeth   
I've heard that all humans are greatly fixated on their appearances.   
Therefore, I'd like to try my hand at dressing up as well.   
If you don't mind terribly, could you please bring me a fashion item that would suit me?   
I believe you could find something in a place where people often gather to mingle... I'll be looking forward to it.   
   
Elizabeth   
There's something I'd like you to bring me...   
It's a small piece with an intricate design of a peacock.   
This piece seems to bring people either unbridled joy or sorrow... and can sometimes be a matter of life or death.   
What would it feel like to have such a piece in my hands...? I'd love to find out.   
   
Elizabeth   
I have longed to visit this place called the "ocean"...   
Alas, as you know, I am unable to abandon my post here.   
So if you ever have the opportunity to visit the ocean...   
Would you look for something that feels like the ocean for me?   
   
Elizabeth   
Have you ever heard of the story about the "straw millionaire"?   
It is the story of a man who becomes wealthy after continuously bartering one item for another...   
I would like to see if such a feat is possible in reality.   
Thus, I have prepared this  for you...   
Please use this  as your first bargaining chip and trade it for something satisfactory.   
   
Elizabeth   
Christmas has brought good cheer to everyone recently. I hear you may even receive a present during this period.   
A figure called "Santa" supposedly flies all over the world, giving gifts to those considered "nice."   
However, I have yet to receive mine. I believe he must have forgotten it... Or worse, misplaced it.   
...May I trouble you to pick up my present from this "Santa"?   
   
Elizabeth   
I hear there are Jack Frost dolls in your world.   
I would like one— No, correction: three of those dolls, please.   
One for me to love, one to display, and one to promote his adorableness.   
   
Elizabeth   
Ever since the time we went around sampling your world's culinary delights, my interest in food has been piqued.   
In my quest for more delicacies, I came across information about this "sushi."   
I learned that it is eaten during festivities and often offered to the gods at their shrines.   
This "sushi" must taste divine, especially if it is the gods' favorite food... I wish to have a bite myself.   
   
Elizabeth   
Now then... How are your Persona abilities coming along? Fairly well, I hope?   
I've actually prepared a little assignment for you, in which you'll have to fuse a Persona.   
I do believe that the best way to deepen your understanding on a topic is with hands-on experience.   
It will be a tad challenging, but do give it a try.

For this request, I would like for you to bring me a certain headgear.   
More specifically, this headgear is a "helm" that has existed since ancient times.   
Since this is an item rich with history, I expect that it will provide the wearer with quality defense...   
I believe you may be acquainted with someone who cherishes one such helm deeply.   
   
Elizabeth   
Ah... About that request: I hear it is very difficult to obtain even one can of .   
Even among canned drink fanatics, only a few have managed to get their hands on it...   
As it would be unwise to conduct a search without any leads, I advise that you first speak with an expert.   
This is merely a hunch, but perhaps you'll find one such person near a persimmon tree...   
   
Elizabeth   
If you don't mind, I'd like you to bring me a certain food...   
However, it is not something that is typically consumed by humans.   
In fact, one of your friends seems to delight in eating it. The furry one with four legs? Did you know that?   
   
Elizabeth   
The request this time is to clean up the city. The location shall be...   
Port Island Station's restroom. Please help clean that area.   
You have already been provided with the necessary cleaning tools, so please make good use of them.   
   
Elizabeth   
While we were taking a stroll around Gekkoukan High School together...   
I noticed the flowers in the rooftop garden were on the verge of dying. Perhaps because not many people frequent that area?   
What a sad sight for such a lovely spot...   
Would you be so kind as to give those flowers some water?   
   
Elizabeth   
...I sense a presence.   
There seems to be a hungry cat somewhere out there.   
It appears to have trouble finding food. As such, it has not yet been fed... Would you please find and feed the poor thing?   
   
Elizabeth   
This time, would you bring me a Featherman R action figure?   
Surely you know the catchphrase? "Evil be gone! The Phoenix Ranger of love and justice is here!"   
And, allow me to clarify, I am only asking for a Featherman R action figure.   
Keep in mind: no other Featherman will do. Not for this request.

Truth be told, my love for soybean powder is rivaled by none.   
I hear something called "pine resin" looks just like my beloved soybean powder.   
I've also heard that it's used as a tool in archery. Do you know anything about it?   
   
Elizabeth   
Do you know of a device called a "handheld game console"?   
I would like you to bring me one.   
Rumor says it's a very dangerous item... But there are also many who love it.   
It is truly a mysterious device... Please be careful when handling it.   
   
Elizabeth   
For this request, I'll be changing it up and issuing it as a little quiz.   
Please bring me a "triangular sword." Your hint: it was originally used for dueling.   
...If you need help figuring it out, perhaps you ought to try asking one of your close friends.   
Sometimes, it is most wise to ask others for assistance.   
   
Elizabeth   
This time, I'd like you to bring me some protein.   
But not just any protein—I'd like one that even amateurs would be able to consume.   
Would you try looking for something like that? If such a thing even exists, of course.   
   
Elizabeth   
Glasses... An object that makes you feel infinitely more intelligent when you don them.   
There is even an item that helps maintain the pristine quality of the lenses. I believe it is called a "glasses wipe"?   
While such an item is not necessary for those who do not wear glasses, it is essential for those who must.   
I would love to get my hands on this "glasses wipe." Would you bring one to me?   
   
Elizabeth   
This time, I'd like for you to bring me a certain plant.   
It is often referred to as the "Christmas star."   
I do not have any more knowledge on this subject. Should you require help, I recommend asking someone well-versed in plants.   
   
Elizabeth   
There exist many types of blades, each with their own uses.   
Among these variations, I would like to study the one known as the "fruit knife."   
The fact that it has "fruit" in the name must mean it possesses some kind of special ability that only works on fruit...   
It is certainly a tool of great interest. Please, bring me one immediately.   
   
Elizabeth   
This time, I'd like you to fetch me some oil.   
Since there is a vast selection of this item, it would undoubtedly be extremely difficult to collect every single variation.   
Therefore, I only ask that you bring me the oil frequently used by one of your acquaintances.   
   
Elizabeth   
Have you ever experienced being pursued relentlessly by a vicious Shadow within the Abyss of Time?   
Yes, I am speaking of the **Reaper**... This time, my request is for you to defeat it.   
No doubt, this is an extremely challenging request, and I do not intend to force it upon you.   
But do consider undertaking it should you have confidence in your abilities.   
   
Elizabeth   
None can deny your power, not after you defeated the Reaper in battle.   
Thus, we have arranged a battle with an opponent befitting your caliber—the ultimate adversary, so to speak.   
I believe you are familiar with "the depths," correct? At its end lies the deepest point of Tartarus.   
Please head there to face this challenge—alone.   
   
Elizabeth   
I'm sure that this request will prove ideal for further drawing out the power of the wild card.   
It is a rather daunting challenge, but I await your report of success.   
   
Elizabeth   
It seems you have finally obtained the .   
This concludes my request for you to gather all of the old documents.   
I wanted you to learn the truth from the eight documents you've collected...   
However, you are already moving towards another truth.   
Although memories may remind you of the past, always walk toward the future...   
Happy - I must admit... I'm a bit envious, since I have neither.   
   
Elizabeth   
It looks like you have obtained the .   
This one seems somewhat different from the old documents you've collected.   
It appears to be a report of an experiment, but it's unfinished—as if the author had been interrupted.   
I can't quite comprehend the subject matter, but perhaps you can make some sense out of it.   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - Well done on fulfilling my request.   
The **Monad Passage** you explored seems to be slightly different from the usual "doors" you've encountered.   
While they may both house strong Shadows...   
The passage seems to lead deeper into the depths, thus harboring even more powerful Shadows.   
But the rewards you reap are far greater.   
By defeating all the Shadows within the passage, you will gain a new Major Arcana...   
Which, in turn, will aid your growth.   
I won't force you to undertake this task, but I do hope you continue to challenge these passages whenever you can.   
Those of us who reside in the Velvet Room are always pleased to bear witness to your growth.   
That will also bring me one step closer to fulfilling my true desire...   
Surprised - ...Oh, my apologies. I didn't intend to take up so much of your time babbling.   
   
Elizabeth   
Well done on vanquishing the Shadow of the Void.   
That was one of the vilest creatures lurking in the shadows of Tartarus.   
I'm very impressed that you managed to defeat it. Truly.   
   
Elizabeth   
Oh, is that perhaps...?   
I see you have obtained a ... It looks as delicious, yet toxic, as ever.   
Happy - One could say I have something of a history with it. Thank you for bringing me one.   
   
Elizabeth   
Oh? Is this the doll so feared by humans?   
I see... So it's called an . The amount of detail is quite impressive.   
But what makes it so terrifying? I find it rather cute. Just look at the way its round eyes stare into your soul.

It is, frankly speaking, quite delectable—though it's rather disappointing there's not much of it to last.   
   
Elizabeth   
Angry - I see, so this is the infamous medicine... Let me have a taste—right now.

Hm... I can't imagine what it sounds like from the words alone. I'll have to listen to it later.   
   
Elizabeth   
So this is the famous ... The aroma truly whets the appetite.   
Now then... Bon appétit.   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - My, how delicious! Something this delectable must have cost a fortune.   
...It didn't? Then I must applaud this corporation's efforts to sell such quality food for cheap.   
   
Elizabeth   
I see that you took on the burger establishment's eating challenge.   
I wasn't aware that completing it would grant you access to an off-menu combo...

Elizabeth   
Surprised - Oh my. Is this... the bouquet of roses I asked for?   
Happy - They're gorgeous. Thank you for this lovely gift. Truly.   
I've heard that, in the language of flowers, the meaning of a bouquet depends on how many stalks there are.   
Happy - So this bouquet means... Hehe, I'll look more into the matter later.   
   
Elizabeth   
How was the outcome of the fortune telling?   
I see... So the predictions really did come true.   
Just who in the world is that fortune-teller...? I hope to meet them someday...   
   
Elizabeth   
So these are the sought-after ...   
Sad - They seem like an ordinary pair of shoes...   
Sad - Perhaps their intended purpose will only reveal itself in a crisis...   
In that case, I'll be returning these. I'm sure they shall prove more useful to you.   
   
Elizabeth   
Did you obtain the  I asked for?   
Surprised - Oh? You do not have them on you right now...   
   
Elizabeth - MND_REQ_REWARDINFO_022_3   
I explained to Elizabeth that   
Aragaki had worn them...   
   
Elizabeth   
Sad - ...I see. In that case, there's nothing that can be done.   
But, as it seems you had obtained them, let us consider this request fulfilled.   
   
Elizabeth   
Hm? It says here... "Tanaka's Amazing Commodities"?   
Ah, it must be that prominent figure's autograph. I must say, he has very beautiful penmanship.   
He must be as powerful as the rumors say... This man who rambles along to a unique melody.   
Happy - Oh, I see that you've acquired a new bond in addition to the autograph. That is very good news indeed.

Elizabeth   
I see... So this is the beverage that bears my name.   
It does indeed say "Elizabeth" on the label, and there is a very lovely, very rich aroma.   
If I am to be honest... it does make me feel a little prideful. I'll take some time to enjoy it later.   
   
Elizabeth   
So this is proof of one of your bonds...   
Though it's made out of ordinary material, I can sense... some sort of warmth from it.   
Happy - You have nurtured a beautiful bond... A precious, irreplaceable bond.   
   
Elizabeth   
Though it has no physical manifestation, I can feel a bond forming between you and me as well...

Behold, the new me! Yaaay!   
Ahem... My apologies. These glasses just suit me so well, I couldn't help but get a little carried away.   
Happy - The moment I slipped them on, I felt my spirits lift. Glasses are truly a gem that complete a person's style.   
It makes me want to wear them all the time. Thank you for bringing me a pair.   
   
Elizabeth   
Oh? Is that not the item I had been seeking all this time?   
What a beautifully painted peacock... Ah, so this is called a ?

Snip, click, snip, click... Their movements are so unique.

I also considered asking you to nurture him until he reaches level 99, but...

Looks like you managed to fuse **Alice** of the Death Arcana. Well done... That completes this request.   
It is to my understanding that she is a difficult one to summon.   
Now you're one step closer to mastering the art of fusion.   
Happy - What spectacular progress you've made.   
   
Elizabeth   
You have certainly nurtured **Loki** to the required level. Well done, that completes this request.   
Now, as for your reward, I've gone ahead and prepared something special.   
With it, you'll be able to fuse **Masakado** of the Tower Arcana.   
Masakado is unbelievably strong, and you will need to be equally powerful to control him.   
But I am confident you are up to the challenge.   
   
Elizabeth   
...Well done. You have a **Masakado** that meets the requirements I specified.   
That brings us to the end of my Persona-related requests.

The heft, the texture... The character for "love" on the brow...   
Does that love... protect the head? Or is it love for the helm...?   
Mysteries upon mysteries... Still, it is a wonderful helm. This satisfies my request.   
Why don't you take the helm with you? I believe it suits you far better than it does me.

Ah, so that's the legendary ... Though at first glance, it appears to be an ordinary can of juice.

So this is the food enjoyed by your little furry friend...   
Oh? The label says, "Luxury Dog Food." Is your friend something of a gourmet?

I truly envy your friend for being able to enjoy such luxurious meals...

Thank you for your help cleaning the Port Island Station restroom.   
The brush you used to clean the bathroom...

Maybe this is a sort of weapon fusion... No?   
   
Elizabeth   
Thank you for watering the flowers that were on the verge of withering.   
I have heard that plants grow so long as one continues to water them.   
Admirable, isn't it? But plants aren't the only ones capable of such a thing.   
Maybe I'll try this watering process on myself as well. There's a part of me I'd like to cultivate...   
The next time you see me, maybe I'll have grown a little in some way.

Interesting... You can put it in various poses and play with it.

Regarding that fountain... I still haven't decided what to wish for.

The fascinating rides, the dangerous traps... and, of course, the cornucopia of curious cuisine.   
The way people went about their lives there was quite different from those we saw previously at Paulownia Mall.   
So that I might not forget what we saw, I'd like to re-create some of the dishes we sampled.   
First, I must hunt for ingredients... Hehe, this will be so much fun!   
   
Elizabeth   
Thank you for showing me around Naganaki Shrine.   
Happy - I must say that the harmony between religion and recreation was indeed superb.   
I am currently in negotiations with my master about introducing a set of horizontal bars in our room.   
If I should win his favor, please stop by to make use of them.   
   
Elizabeth   
Thank you for showing me around Gekkoukan High School.   
I am slowly coming to understand why being there lifted my spirits...   
Gekkoukan isn't just a part of your world... It's a place where you spend a great deal of time on a daily basis...   
It is a place saturated with your presence.   
Sad - That's why I...   
Happy - ......   
...I will set that aside for now. There's more that I need to consider.   
   
Elizabeth   
Thank you so much for showing me your room.   
To show my gratitude for indulging my curiosity to the end, I have something truly special for you.   
With it, you'll be able to fuse **Lucifer** of the Judgement Arcana.   
The lord of Hell, whom no mere human could dare reach—his power unparalleled.   
However, someone of your caliber is plenty capable of rising to the challenge.   
Sad - ......   
Sad - ...I can but only gaze from below.   
However, I...   
I am willing to stay by your side, no matter what heights you reach.   
I will overcome any ordeal that may stand in the way of my goal... That, I believe so.   
This now concludes the last of my requests to explore your world.   
Happy - Thank you very much for everything you've done for me...   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - Oh? Is that soybean powder you have there?   
Ah, no... It must be the pine resin I requested.   
It really does resemble soybean powder...   
It's so similar that even an expert on soybean powder such as myself can't tell the difference.   
Now then, your reward for this request will be... soybean powder. Do enjoy.   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - ...Apologies. I was just using soybean powder to garnish a dish not too long ago, so...   
   
Elizabeth   
Is that a handheld game console?   
I've heard these have special mechanisms that make the player forget about the passage of time...   
Angry - Though it doesn't seem to be particularly special at first glance.   
Surprised - Perhaps this device shoots out some kind of ray when the power is turned on, and your memory get—   
   
...Apologies, but I must pass this time. Thank you for bringing me one, but you can have it back.   
   
Elizabeth   
Bingo! That is indeed what I requested—a fencing épée.   
As I mentioned before, an épée was used to duel in ancient times.   
Fencers would wear white uniforms so that the blood from struck blows would be more visible.   
And now, a special quiz just for you. Do you know why my clothes are blue?   
   
top - SEL_REQ_REWARDINFO_075_2   
Because it suits you.   
Because it's soothing.   
No reason in particular.   
   
Elizabeth - SEL_REQ_REWARDINFO_075_3   
Happy - ......   
...I will ask my master for the correct answer.   
   
Elizabeth   
This must be the brand of protein specially designed for amateur athletes...   
Angry - "Amateur-Pro Tein"? How can it be for both amateurs and pros?   
Ah... The word "protein" doesn't have anything to do with "professionals." How very interesting.   
Thank you very much. I am sure this must be quite valuable, so you may have it back.   
   
Elizabeth   
So this must be the sort of thing one would use to clean a pair of eyeglasses.   
Fine microfibers, maximum flexibility and absorbency, and an ideal size... It's utterly perfect.   
I see... It wasn't just any old rag, after all.   
Hm...? You've brought something else with you? May I see that as well?   
   
Elizabeth - MND_REQ_REWARDINFO_077_2   
I gave Elizabeth the .   
   
Elizabeth   
Oh my...! What elegance! Though resemblant of my master, this does leave a different impression.   
   
Elizabeth   
Not Used   
   
   
Elizabeth   
Well? What do you think? The mustache makes my nose itch a fair bit though...   
Happy - Not only does it give me a semblance of intelligence, but also one of harmony as well... What a splendid item.   
   
Elizabeth   
That red-leafed plant... Is that the Christmas star?   
Surprised - I was led to believe there would be presents growing from this plant.   
This fulfills my request, but you can take it back with you.   
Although once the presents are in bloom, I'd like for these plants to fill our room...   
   
Elizabeth   
What a sharp, shining blade... That must be the fruit knife I asked for.   
It seems as though it's been in use for a long time, but it's almost as sharp as the day it was made...   
I bet it has been used to cut a wide variety of things, not just fruit.   
It's an all-purpose cooking tool.   
Surprised - Hm? There's something written on the handle. "Graduation"... "gift"... "orphanage"...   
This item appears to be quite dear to someone, so be sure to take it back with you.   
   
Elizabeth   
Ah, is that the oil I requested?   
Surprised - "Silicone oil for precision components"? My, this seems to be the real deal...   
I wonder what its intended use is... Should I apply it? Soak in it? Or perhaps, drink it...?   
Well, in any case, this completes my request. As for the oil... you can take it back with you.   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - I must admit, I wasn't entirely sure you would be able to conquer this endeavor. A most pleasant surprise, indeed.   
Surely, asking these requests of you was...   
......   
Surprised - Apologies. I seem to have found my mind wandering again.   
The request has been completed. Very well done.   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - Hehe... This request requires no confirmation, of course.   
It was the last thing I'll ask of you.   
Here is your reward—the gift of ultimate power...   
No matter where you go or what you do...   
I'm certain you will persevere and overcome every single obstacle in your way.   
Happy - Thank you so much for indulging my curiosity.   
   
Elizabeth   
I see that you have successfully performed the "Dreamfest" Fusion Spell.   
It would appear that you have further harnessed your power once again. That completes this request.

Aigis, do you have a minute? I wanted to ask you something.   
   
Metis   
Oh, um... Should I leave?   
   
Metis   
...I'll come back later, then.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - No, no, I didn't mean it like that. Actually, I'd like your opinion, too, Metis.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - No, wait! I'd actually like your opinion, too, Metis.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Have I, um... Have I been doing a good job providing support? It's been a while, so I'm not that confident anymore...

You're doing as well as ever.   
I can't really say...   
You should be more confident.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Really...? Well, if you say so...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Because it's too hard to say it out loud...? I'm so sorry, Aigis. I didn't mean to pressure you.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Yeah... You're right. I need to get my act together.   
   
Metis   
...I don't understand. Why do you lack confidence in your area of expertise?   
Even if we had said that your performance was flawless, you still wouldn't have believed us.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Huh...? Y-You think so? I didn't mean that at all...   
   
Metis   
Aren't you in the support role because you wanted it?   
   
Metis   
Happy - Take me, for example. I'm here because I want to protect my sister!   
Happy - And I don't second-guess my decisions.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Hehe, wow... You're so cool, Metis.   
   
Metis   
Surprised - Huh...? Isn't this just normal?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Well... It's hard for me to have as much confidence as other people would. I see what you mean, though.   
Happy - And the way you're so sure of yourself is actually really inspiring.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I doubt I can change right away, but... I do want to be more confident in myself.   
Happy - I need some time to think about what it is I want to accomplish.   
   
Metis   
Surprised - Don't make this weird... I was just saying what anyone else would. Right, Sister?

You're truly inspirational.   
There's no need to be shy.   
   
Metis   
Happy - Y-You really think so? Ehehe...   
   
Metis   
Surprised - I'm not, though...   
Surprised - ...Okay, maybe just a little bit.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Regardless, thank you both for your help. Rest assured, you can count on me for our next trip!   
   
Metis   
Angry - Wh-What!? You're not going to outclass me! Just watch, Sister—I'll handle everything myself next time!   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
It took a joint effort between   
Fuuka-san and me to get Metis   
to calm down.

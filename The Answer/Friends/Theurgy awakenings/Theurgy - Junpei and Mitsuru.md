Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Man, something just feels off... Like I'm in some kinda funk.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - But, c'mon... It's not like this is that much different from before, so what's up with me all of a sudden?   
Exasperated* - Maybe I'm just...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Nah, no frickin' way! Quit thinkin' like that, Junpei!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What's gotten you so distressed, Iori?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - "Distressed"? Who's distressed? Definitely not me, hahaha...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Was I mistaken? It certainly seemed like it to me.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Our weakened Persona abilities have made for some difficult battles, haven't they?   
I can understand your anxiety.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - But you're not the only one dealing with this. We are all experiencing the same struggle.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Yeah, I know... I get that, but...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ...Hm.   
Sad - This really isn't my strong suit—comforting people, I mean. It requires a certain intuition.   
Exasperated* - It appears that making Aigis the leader was the right call.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - That's why!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Is it that surprising? It's only natural to seek assistance to cover one's weaknesses.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Huh... You've got a point. Now that I think about it, of course you'd say that.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - I should have known this already... Why'd I lose sight of it?   
Exasperated* - All that stuff about you, Senpai... and about myself.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Iori...?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Heh, don't you worry about me! It's okay to be a loser, because nobody's perfect, right?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - I'm afraid I don't follow... But if that's what makes you feel better, then that's all that matters.   
Happy - Honestly, I'm relieved. It's been quite a while since I've last seen that carefree smile of yours.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, uh, has it? Guess so...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - You know...   
Happy - Your smile reminded me of something as well.   
Happy - Or rather, someone I want to protect—not for my family's sake, but for my own.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Horrified - What, you mean like... a lover!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Do you think this is funny, Iori? Tread lightly.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Dang, tough crowd.   
Happy - Anyway, I kinda get you, I think.   
Very happy* - The times we're all together, well... Those are the memories I treasure most.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Precisely.

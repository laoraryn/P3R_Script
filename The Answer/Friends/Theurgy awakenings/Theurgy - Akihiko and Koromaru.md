Guess I need to push my limits even harder...

Koromaru
Ruff!

Akihiko Sanada
Oh, sorry, Koromaru. Hey, listen, I was just thinking...
What do you say to a little exploring, just you and me? Might make for decent training.

Koromaru
Happy - Arf, arf!

Akihiko Sanada
Scheming - Heh, rarin' to go, huh? Glad I can always count on you, Koromaru.

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - Phew... That was pretty tough on our own. Should've figured.

Koromaru
Sad - *whimper*

Akihiko Sanada
Sad - Don't get me wrong, I'm not beating myself up over it.

Akihiko Sanada
I know there's only so much I handle by myself... Not like I can think fast on my feet, either.
No matter what's in front of me, I always come out swinging the second the bell rings.
Angry - I've gone through this exact same thing before, but I guess I just forgot.
Angry - Was it after we got weaker...? No, it must have happened way before that.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Thanks for this, Koromaru. Sorry you had to put up with such a moron.

Koromaru
Happy - Awoooooo!

Akihiko Sanada
Surprised - ...Hang on, was there something weighing on your mind, too?
Happy - I had no clue. You just look like the same ol' handsome devil to me.

Koromaru
Arf!

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Well, should we start heading back?

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - But don't tell Aigis or Mitsuru about any of this. It'll be our heads if they find out we went off exploring on our own.

Koromaru
Sad - *whine*

Metis
Um, did you need me to explain anything?

top - SEL_010_0_0
Tell me about the Abyss of Time.
Tell me about your abilities.
Not at this time, no.

Metis
I believe the Abyss has spread beneath us, like the roots of a tree.
Basically, it branches out in various directions, going deeper and deeper down.
And the area right below us is the Desert of Doors...
Each door there seems to lead to a different place. We should be able to use them to traverse to other areas.

Metis
The weapon I wield is different from yours. It's a heavy melee weapon with some range.
My Persona's name is **Psyche**.
Happy - Unlike you, I can only summon one Persona, but I don't lack for sheer strength and determination!

Metis
Happy - No need to worry! I'll be at your side every step of the way!

Metis
So that shady-looking person... Kurosawa, you said? He's a shopkeeper?
What kind of store does he run, exactly...?

Metis
Happy - Truth be told... I think I'm actually starting to enjoy this exploring stuff!
Happy - Isn't this rather fun, Sister?

top - SEL_015_0_0
Yes, it is.
You should ask the others, too.

Metis
Happy - I know we need to hurry and get through the Abyss for your sake, but...
It'd be kind of sad for all this to come to an end... if you get what I'm saying.

Metis
Sad - Oh... I'm sorry.
Sad - I just... don't know the others all that well, so it's hard for me to figure out what to say to them.
Looking away - ......

Metis
Happy - I'll do whatever I can to help make this expedition easier for you, Sister.

Metis
The date's different every time we go to that mall, isn't it?
The store lineup is always changing, and even though everything looks the same, it doesn't feel like it...
Perhaps this aspect of the mall is also being influenced by everyone's thoughts.

Metis
Sad - School, huh...
Sad - Oh, right... Everyone here has made memories with you outside of combat and exploring... Everyone but me.
Sad - ......
Happy - Well, no point dwelling on that! I'll just give this expedition 110%!

Metis
Koromaru-san always seems to be worried about everyone... No, more like he's always watching over everyone.
Happy - It's like he thinks himself the alpha here even though you're our leader, Sister.

top - SEL_026_0_0
I am, but only for now.
No, I'm not really.

Metis
That's strange...
Whenever I tell Koromaru-san that you're the leader, he wears the same expression as you do now...
Sad - ......
Sad - Well, I guess it's not my place to talk. Not like I know much about this kind of thing...

Metis
Surprised - Don't say that! It'll go to Koromaru-san's head!
But... When I accused him of acting like the leader, he said the same thing as you.
Sad - ......
Sad - Well, I guess it's not my place to talk. Not like I know much about this kind of thing...

Metis
Sad - Both you and Koromaru-san are acting weird... Because you're the true leader, Sister.

Metis
Happy - We've explored over half of the doors by now... Enough to start to see how those memories are all connected.
Happy - There's still much we don't know about that mysterious figure, but let's keep pressing on! Just a little further now!

Metis
I think Fuuka-san might know something about that figure we keep seeing.
But... It doesn't look like she wants to talk about it. Maybe she's waiting until we get more solid intel?
She should just tell us what she knows anyway, so we can all share our thoughts.

Metis
Sad - I am not a kid...
Sad - I've been helping. I kept my promise and haven't hurt anyone. So why am I always left out and treated like some child...?

Metis
I just don't understand what's going through everyone's heads... Please don't let them get to you, though, Sister.
Happy - I'll protect you in their place. No matter what.
Once we leave... We're all going to be split up.
You won't be able to see your friends after this. Are you ready?

top - SEL_033_0_0
I'm ready.
Just one minute...

Metis
Okay... Follow me, then.

Metis
Did you need some time to restock our supplies and prep for the battle ahead?
Because dwelling on this matter any longer... won't change anything.

Metis
Sad - Sister... Please don't forget—this key is connected to your life.
Sad - I won't be holding back against your friends, and... I want you to do the same.

Metis
I won't stop.
Sad - Even if you hate me for this... No matter how painful it may be...
Looking away - ......

Metis
Sad - Sister... I...

top - SEL_040_0_0
Don't let it bother you.
I'm so sorry.

Metis
Sad - But... it does.
Sad - Back then, when I intended to eliminate everyone... I didn't even think twice about hurting them.
Looking away - I didn't know that losing someone important to you... could make you feel like this.
Crying - I... I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...
Crying - But to me... you come first...

Metis
Angry - No! It's not your fault, Sister!
Sad - I just... I wasn't prepared for this. I didn't know. That's why I could say such cruel things...
Crying - I... I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...
Crying - But to me... you come first...

Metis
Looking away - I'm so sorry, Sister...

Metis
Oh, Sister, I... I'm starting to understand things a little better now.
Sad - Or at least, I think I am...
Sad - Things like, why I don't know anything about myself... Why you're so important to me...
Looking away - And who... who I really am...

Metis
Happy - Sister, do you have some time right now? There's something I want to show you...

Metis - MND_095_0_0
Should I spend time with Metis...?

top - SEL_096_0_0
I think I will.
Not right now, no.

Metis
Happy - Yay! Remember that thing we found in the Abyss? That strange, cup-like object with a hole?
Happy - Amada-san actually taught me how to use it. Come, I'll show you!

Metis
Sad - Oh, okay...
Sad - I won't force you if you're too busy.

Metis
Sister, do you remember that book we found in the Abyss?
Apparently, this  is an item used by close friends and family.
So... If you have the time, maybe we could fill it out together?

Metis
Happy - Hooray! Let's do an exchange, then!
Happy - So basically, we each have to answer the questions, then trade pages to show each other what we wrote!
Happy - I've been wanting to do this with you, Sister. I'm so, so happy right now.

Metis
Sad - Oh, okay...
Sad - I won't force you if you're too busy.

Metis
Oh, Sister! Do you have some time right now?
I was thinking we could fill out that book we found in the Abyss together...

So that "Abyss of Time" down there is what caused all this, huh?   
Guess we'll have to go in and try to figure this all out.   
Sounds like no one has a clue what's really in there, but that's all the more reason to check it out.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - A door that leads to the past...   
Surprised - Didn't your sister say there are multiple of them too?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Now that we can get to Kurosawa-san, I guess we're good to go for a long haul.   
Exasperated* - Ugh...   
Exasperated* - How long is this all gonna take...?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We've checked out barely any of the doors down there. We should pick up the pace.   
Let's try to just get this over with as fast as we can. Otherwise, we'll be here forever...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
About Metis... Maybe I've just been misunderstanding her.   
I mean, she doesn't seem like a bad person or anything... We just didn't exactly get off on the right foot with her, you know?   
What do you think?

Agreed—she's not a bad person.   
I'm not sure yet...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Yeah, right?   
Happy - I get the feeling she's just... overly protective.   
Happy - So as long as you keep an eye on her, I don't think she'll really be dangerous to us.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hm... Well, make sure you keep a close eye on her, then.   
If nothing else, it seems like she'll at least listen to you.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I know there isn't really a reason to check the schedule since we're just exploring all the time now, but...   
I don't know... I guess I keep looking at it out of habit.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - I never knew his dad's an alcoholic... I think I kinda get how he feels.   
Looking away - It's not like I just pity him or anything. It's... I don't know...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - It feels so long ago now, but... I used to not really like Mitsuru-senpai very much.   
Sad - It's like I thought I was the only one going through stuff. And I had all these assumptions and made her out to be the bad guy.   
Looking away - *sigh*   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - That strange figure somehow always appears just ahead of us...   
Sad - How long is it gonna keep this up? I wish it'd just show itself already.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - When someone says something that hits a nerve, it's probably because there's some truth in what they said.   
Looking away - When she said how all we talk and laugh about is stuff from our past, I wanted to be like, "You don't know anything about our past!"   
Sad - But maybe her not having the whole picture of our past is exactly why she's actually right. Even if we're not doing it intentionally...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
If we want to solve this, we just gotta reach the end.   
So we might as well get going instead of wasting our time trying to figure it all out ourselves first.   
Angry - I wanna see what that figure really is too... Let's go end this whole thing already.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - I'm not trying to say I'm objectively right here or anything, but we don't have enough time to keep arguing.   
Looking away - I just...   
Looking away - Toward the end of our fight with Nyx, I couldn't even move. All I could do was watch as he left us...   
Angry - So I want to go back and leave no regrets this time. I mean, facing our regrets was the whole point of all this, right?   
Angry - And you need to come to a decision too. I won't accept that you just don't have any opinions about this.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - I think... I'm actually glad that I lost to you.   
Sad - If I tried to do the past over again with the mindset I was in, I probably would've ended up having even more regrets...   
Looking away - It's... honestly embarrassing how little I've processed everything.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very angry* - Oh, I heard from Fuuka...   
Angry - You could've died if you lost your key?   
Angry - Why didn't you say anything? I would've...   
Looking away - Actually... I probably would've done everything the same anyways. I was only thinking about myself. I'm so sorry...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
What's up? Need something?   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
Should I spend some   
time with Yukari-san...?   
   
top - SEL_055_0_0   
I think I will.   
Not right now.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh. Okay, then. Uh... Wanna chat for a bit?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
All right. See ya.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I've been reading this  and it's really getting good.   
Happy - Maybe we can read together. Are there any books you've been meaning to check out?

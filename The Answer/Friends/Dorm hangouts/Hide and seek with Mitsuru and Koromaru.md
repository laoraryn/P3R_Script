Happy - Heh... Are you having a hard time, Koromaru? Just keep at it. I know you can find it.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We're playing a little game I learned from Yamagishi.   
Koromaru has to find a specific object by scent alone. In a way, it's like treasure hunting.

That sounds like fun.   
He's like a police dog.   
You're not taking him for a walk?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Oh? You think so, too? Truth be told, I've found that hiding the target is rather fun as well.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Apparently, police dogs undergo similar training for scent tracking as well.   
Considering how talented Koromaru is, perhaps he'd do quite well in that field.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - I wish I could, but there's only so much space we have to work with.   
Sad - That's why I'm testing different ways to enrich his mind while we're trapped indoors.   
   
Koromaru   
Angry - Grrr...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Growl all you want. I'm not telling you where it is.   
   
Koromaru   
Sad - ......   
Sad - *whine*

But he's so pitiful...   
Don't give up!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Don't give into the puppy eyes, Aigis. We both know Koromaru is very much capable.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Precisely. I know you can do this, Koromaru.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I admit, I did make this round harder. The scent is weaker, and there are more dead ends to throw him off the trail.   
Not only that, but I also hid it in an elevated location that's difficult for him to access.

That seems excessive...   
Koromaru-san will pull through.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Amada and Yamagishi said the same thing.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Agreed. I prepared this puzzle bearing that in mind.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
In the face of a challenge, I believe what's most important... is upholding respect.   
From where I stand, disregarding one's weakness is neither kindness nor fairness.   
In actuality, it's overconfidence, plain and simple—and no different from looking down on the opponent.   
That's why I never hold back, no matter who or what I'm up against.   
   
Koromaru's Voice   
Arf!   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Arf!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Yes! Très bien! I never doubted you for a moment, Koromaru.   
I'm fortunate to be surrounded by such reliable friends... Perhaps that's why I can afford to be more optimistic.   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
After her game with Koromaru-san,   
Mitsuru-san seems to have   
reaffirmed her principles...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - I'll have to ramp up the difficulty as well so that you won't find the next one so quickly.   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Arf!

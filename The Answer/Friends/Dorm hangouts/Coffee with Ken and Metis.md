Metis   
I comprehend...   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - My nerves are killing me...   
Surprised - All I did was mention the . Why is this happening to me...?   
   
Metis   
So that's how you assemble a beverage... How very intriguing.   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - I-It's nothing really. Um...   
   
Ken Amada   
How's the taste?   
   
Metis   
Surprised - The taste?   
   
Metis   
Surprised - The... taste?   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - You don't need to think that hard about it...   
   
Metis   
Surprised - Er, I-I'll give it another shot. Maybe I'll figure it out with another cup!   
   
Metis   
Sad - I drank every last drop, but...   
   
Ken Amada   
Aigis-san hasn't touched hers yet. Would you like to try that one, too?   
   
Metis   
Surprised - What!? Can I really...?

Of course.   
You're overreacting.   
Remember to savor the taste.   
   
Metis   
Happy - I-In that case, don't mind if I do!   
   
Metis   
Angry - I'm not! This is a really, really big deal to me!   
   
Metis   
Happy - Yes, of course! Since it was your cup to begin with, Sister, I'll be sure to savor it a hundredfold!   
   
Metis   
Upset - ......   
   
Ken Amada   
Um... How does it taste this time?   
   
Metis   
Much better than the first one.   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - How? They were both brewed with the same coffee beans. There can't be that big of a difference...   
   
Metis   
You can technically assign quantifiable values for comparison, but it's difficult to present the outputted data clearly.   
Very happy* - It's also unnecessary when the fact is... receiving this cup from my sister is what makes it better!   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
Metis seems pleased   
with her new discovery...   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - I just wanted to hear your impressions on the flavor profile...

It had a pleasant aroma.   
I apologize...   
Please don't be too upset.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Haha... Thank you.   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - Oh, you don't have anything to be sorry about, Aigis-san...   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - I'm not, though... Not really...   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Why's it so hard to brew a good cup...?   
   
Metis   
Surprised - Oh, um... The coffee was, uh... really tasty?

Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Ohhh! That makes so much more sense now.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oops, sorry. Sometimes I think out loud when I read. Um... What're you reading, Aigis? What's it about?   
   
top - SEL_002_0_0   
Mechanical engineering.   
Physiological psychology.   
It's a shojo manga.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Oh, so like... So you can learn how your body works or something? That's cool.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - "Physio"... Uh, the "psychology" part means it has to do with the mind and mental health and stuff, right?   
Surprised - I didn't know you were into that kinda thing.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Really? I never would've thought you'd be into that, given the other kinds of stuff you read.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
This dorm sure has all kinds of books, huh? Everything from casual manga to super complicated stuff.   
When we picked up this book in the Abyss of Time... It reminded me of this place.   
And of how I never really read any of the books here...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - So I kinda thought... Maybe now's a good time.   
Happy - You gotta make time to take breaks once in a while, right? Like when we watched that show together.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - A lot of the others used to read here, right? Fuuka, Mitsuru-senpai... Him, too.   
Happy - It was kinda relaxing even just watching them from a distance. But I could never bring myself to just walk up and ask to join them...   
Happy - But yeah... When they took breaks, they were definitely getting something out of it.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - So, I guess I'm trying to follow their example or something.   
Sad - That probably sounds kinda dumb, huh?   
   
top - SEL_010_0_0   
Not at all.   
It's good to follow examples.   
You can join me anytime.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Oh...   
Happy - Um... Thanks.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Haha, you sounded so serious just now. But I guess that's not exactly out of character for you.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Oh, uh... Okay, thanks.   
Happy - I wasn't really expecting someone to just come right out and say it, haha.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very happy* - So, anyway... Yeah, let's just take it easy for a little while longer.   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
Yukari-san's voice sounds   
calm, yet empowered...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - But that means we're gonna have to work twice as hard later to make up for it.   
   
top - SEL_017_0_0   
Of course.   
Do we have to...?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Yeah. We'll have more time to relax after we get out of here.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Come on, get with the program! We'll have plenty of time to relax after we get out of here.

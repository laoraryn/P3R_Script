Metis   
Let's see here... My name is Metis... And my nickname...   
Surprised - My nickname?   
   
Metis   
Surprised - Sister, do I have a nickname?   
   
top - SEL_002_0_0   
"Li'l Sis."   
You're simply "Metis."   
I don't know...   
   
Metis   
Oh, some of your friends call me that. I see, so it counts as a nickname...   
   
Metis   
Happy - That's true! And there's nothing more special than your own name.   
   
Metis   
Sad - Well, if you don't know, then I doubt anyone else would, either...   
   
Metis   
Hm, this next section is about... my role model.   
Happy - Obviously, my sister.   
Happy - My favorite thing? Also my sister. And so is this one... And this one, and...   
   
Metis   
Very happy* - ...Okay, all done!

Good job.   
Was I the answer to everything?   
   
Metis   
Happy - Oh, it was nothing, hehe.   
   
Metis   
Surprised - Huh? I don't... think so?   
Surprised - ......   
Happy - Well, I guess things just happen to turn out that way.   
   
Metis   
So... How far did you get? Are you already done?

I'm still writing.   
Please give me a moment.   
Must I fill one out, too?   
   
Metis   
Happy - Well, you're doing great, Sister!   
   
Metis   
Happy - Okay! I'll be patient and wait right here for you to finish.   
   
Metis   
Of course you do! That's the whole point of this .   
Happy - Also... I was hoping we could exchange them.   
   
Metis   
Happy - And that does it for the  exchange. Mission success!   
   
Metis   
Happy - I'm so happy we were able to carry out our own exchange...   
   
Metis   
Happy - I get this strange feeling whenever I receive something from you, Sister...   
Happy - Like a sense of fulfillment whenever you gift me things or trust me with something.   
Happy - It's hard to articulate it effectively, but I feel as if... As if my chest is swelling up—to the point it might just burst.

I think I understand.   
I'm afraid I don't follow.   
But from what...?   
   
Metis   
Surprised - You do?   
Happy - Then you must have someone in your life who's just as important to you as you are to me.   
Happy - And that thought makes my chest feel even more full... It's overwhelming.   
   
Metis   
Surprised - That's okay. I'm actually not too sure what it all means, either.   
   
Metis   
Surprised - Hm... I don't really know, but whatever it is, I doubt it's something bad.   
Happy - After all, it feels so pleasant and warm... So it has to be good, right?   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
Metis seems to be deeply   
reflecting on her feelings...   
   
Metis   
Happy - This is my new treasure.   
Very happy* - I'll always cherish it and keep it safe. I hope you feel the same way with mine.

Happy - All right! That should do it!

Ken Amada
What do you think? You could never tell how bad of a shape it was in before, right?

You get a gold star!
Impressive!

Ken Amada
Surprised - Come on, you don't have to say it like I'm a little kid.

Ken Amada
Happy - Hehe... Yeah, I guess.

Ken Amada
I've been thinking I should do this kind of thing more.
Before, if something was broken, I wouldn't really think about it much.
But lately, I've started feeling like I should fix them up so they can keep being used.

That's wonderful.
We'll take good care of it.
I should take after you.

Ken Amada
Happy - I only started thinking about it recently, so I'm probably not that good at it yet.

Ken Amada
Happy - Yeah. As long as I have it, I'll fix it up as many times as it needs.

Ken Amada
Well, if there's ever anything you need fixed, we can do it together!
Happy - But I don't think I can promise that it'll always turn out well.

Ken Amada
Sad - Everything falls apart eventually... That's why we have to take care of it all.
Happy - And if we take care of things well enough in the first place, they won't need as much fixing later.

Aigis - Thoughts
Amada-san seems to have come
to a profound understanding...

Ken Amada
Sad - But I have to admit... It's kind of disappointing this turned out to be just some regular book.
Sad - I mean, I could still read the pages before, so I kind of already knew that...

Ken Amada
Happy - I guess I was expecting something special since we found it in the Abyss of Time. Oh well.

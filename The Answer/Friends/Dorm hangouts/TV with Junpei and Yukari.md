Happy - Yo! Just who I was lookin' for!
Happy - You guys wanna check out this  with me?

Yukari Takeba
Angry - Are you serious? We have more important things to do, you know.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Wait, hear me out! We found this in the Abyss of Time, so it coulda been made by our minds or somethin', right?

That's a good point.
You just want to slack off.

Junpei Iori
Very happy* - Right?
Happy - And I've actually wanted to watch this series for a while anyways. Look how productive I'm bein'!

Junpei Iori
Surprised - I so totally don't! This is some serious shit right here!
Sad - I mean, it does happen to be a series I've been wantin' to watch, but that's just a coincidence.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Wow...

Junpei Iori
Happy - C'mooon, just one episode? Then I'll shut up about it, I swear!

Yukari Takeba
Only one episode, remember? No trying to get us to watch more.

Junpei Iori
Happy - Yeah, yeah, I know!
Surprised - Man, shit's hittin' the fan now, huh? Talk about the fate of the entire world...

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - No kidding... And the production is insane!

Junpei Iori
Happy - Whew... That was a close one.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Wait, THAT'S where it ends!?
Angry - They didn't resolve anything! What ended up happening to the daughter!?

Junpei Iori
Happy - Yeah, these foreign shows do that a lot. They always got so much goin' on.
Happy - But damn, Yuka-tan... For someone who was so against watching it, you sure got into it, huh?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Well... You were so loud, I had to pay extra attention to it to tune you out!

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Anyway, what are we even doing? This is a waste of time...

Breaks are important too.
We can still work hard later.
It was fun, though.

Yukari Takeba
Looking away - Sure, but still...

Yukari Takeba
Looking away - Yeah, I guess...

Yukari Takeba
Looking away - I mean...
Sad - I'll admit, it was fun, but...

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Well... It was kinda relaxing, so... It's probably fine once in a while.
Exasperated* - It's not like we'd be able to give it everything we've got when we really need to if we're stressed out all the time...

Aigis - Thoughts
It seems watching the drama has helped Yukari-san acknowledge the value of taking breaks...

Junpei Iori
Very happy* - Alright, next episode!

Yukari Takeba
Angry - No. We made a deal.
Happy - Breaktime's over. Let's go.

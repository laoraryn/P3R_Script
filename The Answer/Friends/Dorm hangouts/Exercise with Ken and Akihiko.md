Happy - ...I'm starting to get it now. This sure is helpful!
Happy - I've never thought much about why you'd do certain exercises or regimens... or anything like that, really.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - You should. It's important to know where your muscles are located and how they work together.

Ken Amada
Happy - Thanks for demonstrating, Aigis! That made everything so much easier to understand.

You're welcome.
I also learned something new.

Akihiko Sanada
Anything else you're curious about? I'm all ears, ask away.

Ken Amada
Sad - Well... Yeah, kind of. But it's fine, really! It's not a big deal or anything...

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Don't be afraid to ask questions. If there's anything you want to know, let's hear it.

Ken Amada
It's... It's about what the book said at the end.
The "never give up no matter what" and "press forward in the face of failure" bit.
Isn't that more about developing mental fortitude than actual strength? Failing means not getting results, right?

Akihiko Sanada
Hm... Yeah, you've got a good point there.
However, regular training improves more than just your physical strength.

Akihiko Sanada
Aigis, do you know what I'm getting at?

It gives you guts.
It boosts your confidence.
Definitely muscle growth.

Akihiko Sanada
Exasperated* - I mean, you're not wrong, but... That might be a bit hard for Amada to understand.
You're close, though. I'm talking about that feeling you get when you conquer a milestone, that boost in confidence.

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Heh. Exactly. Specifically the confidence you gain after conquering a milestone in your training.

Akihiko Sanada
Exasperated* - I was just saying there's more to it than that...
After conquering a milestone in your training, you gain more confidence in yourself.

Akihiko Sanada
And that confidence you build will see you through any future hardship yet to come.
Happy - You'll believe that you can pull through, that there's nothing you can lose to after everything you've endured.

Ken Amada
Surprised - Wow... You really think so?

Akihiko Sanada
The real battle takes place before you even get in the ring.
If you want to make progress, then you've got to commit to training—every day, nonstop, no shortcuts.
Sometimes I forget that myself, but it's important to bring it back to the forefront and stick to your routine.

Aigis - Thoughts
After saying his piece to
Amada-san, Sanada-san seems
to be deep in thought.

Akihiko Sanada
Of course, that alone isn't enough to secure victory. You also need to figure out a regimen best suited for your goals.

Ken Amada
Happy - Got it! Thank you for helping me out, Sanada-san!

Akihiko Sanada
Happy - Actually... You helped me reignite my passion for this sort of thing, Amada. I should be the one thanking you.

Akihiko Sanada
Looks like I took up more of your time than expected.
Happy - At least Amada got something out of it. Thanks for lending us a hand.

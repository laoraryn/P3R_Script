Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Huh...   
Surprised - People make cooking look so easy. I thought I could just whip something up, lickety-split.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Hey, Ai-chan, is cooking actually... really hard?

It appears so.   
I'm not sure myself.   
Only because you lack skill.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - ...Yep, sure does.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Yeah, I don't got a clue, either...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - W-Well, that's just a matter of perspective! Pretty sure.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Whatever! 'Sides, it's way too early to throw in the towel!   
Angry - If I give up now, then the only thing I managed to do was fail!   
Angry - C'mon, Ai-chan! Let's put our heads together and turn the dang tables, yeah?   
   
top - SEL_007_0_0   
Yes, let's!   
I fear it is too far gone...   
But this table cannot be turned.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Scheming - Hell yeah! We've got this in the bag. Now's my chance for a heroic comeback!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - No way! Stop with that quitter talk. The time for action is now!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Oh, c'mon, don't pull a Sanada-san on me! You'll see, I won't lose here! I'll come out on top for sure!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Very angry* - Alright, time to unleash my ultimate attack! Eat thiiis!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Damn, can't believe I actually turned that disaster of a dish into a tasty, chunky curry.   
Surprised - That roux sure is one hell of a miracle worker.   
Surprised - I know Sanada-san told me to be more realistic, but you really can turn the tables in an instant.

It's certainly possible.   
That may not happen every time.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Exactly! That's why you just gotta go for it, y'know?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Well, yeah, sure. But you know...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Maybe some folks prefer to pull back and try again later because... Because they're confident they'll succeed next time.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - But me? Not so much. I just kinda panic—like, I gotta do something NOW 'cause there might not be a next time.   
Guess that's why I like those ultimate attacks so much—they can turn things around in just one move.   
Exasperated* - Maybe I'll be strong enough to pull one off whenever, wherever I want someday.   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
It seems Junpei-san   
experienced an epiphany...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Welp, I'm stuffed! How 'bout we put all this away and get goin'?   
Happy - Thanks for hangin' with me, Aigis!

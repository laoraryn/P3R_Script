Fuuka Yamagishi
Oh, hello, you two! Have you been playing together?

Koromaru
Sad - *whine*

Mitsuru Kirijo
It sounds like you want to tell us something, Koromaru. Is something the matter?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - Maybe he's hungry?

Koromaru
Happy - Arf!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - That must be it!
Happy - Oh, that reminds me of that food we found. It looked like it would be really yummy for Koro-chan.
Happy - I think it was called .

Koromaru
Happy - Arf!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Exasperated* - Oh, is that what you really wanted this whole time?

Koromaru
Happy - Arf! Arf, arf!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Hold on, now. It's not time to eat yet. It's important that we adhere to our schedules.

Koromaru
Sad - ......

We can't change meal time.
Don't give us that face.
This is a conundrum...

Koromaru
Sad - ......

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Koro-chan...
Sad - Well... You can hold out, right? Because you're a good, strong boy!

Koromaru
Sad - ......

Maybe just this once...?

Koromaru
*pant* *pant*

Koromaru
Sad - *whine*

Mitsuru Kirijo
Exasperated* - Well... I suppose we can make an exception.
Exasperated* - After all, these extraordinary circumstances we've found ourselves in must be taking their toll on Koromaru as well.

Koromaru
Happy - Arf! Arf, arf!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I guess this all ended up going just as Koro-chan wanted.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Indeed.
Happy - He's certainly masterful at getting others to bend to his will, even without the ability to speak.

Koromaru
Happy - Arf!

Aigis - Thoughts
I can feel Koromaru-san's unwavering spirit...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Exasperated* - Eating too much isn't good, though... We'll have to be extra careful about his calorie and fat intake after this.
Exasperated* - Maybe we should add more vegetables to his diet.

Koromaru
Angry - Grrr...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Now, now, Koromaru. It's unbecoming to be a picky eater.

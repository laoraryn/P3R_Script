I feel like it's not just my Persona abilities that were affected. I can't handle my weapon as well as I used to, either.   
I guess battling is kind of like studying. You have to keep at it if you want to maintain a certain level of aptitude...   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - We actually went back to the past...?   
Surprised - In a way, this feels far more dangerous than the Dark Hour. Don't you think so, too?   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - The view outside the window looks normal, but I can't shake this weird feeling...   
Sad - I can't exactly put my finger on it... For all I know, it could just be my imagination.   
   
Ken Amada   
Oh, are you worried about how I'm taking all of that? I'm honestly okay... That was so long ago now.   
But, um...   
Happy - Thank you... Aigis-san.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - I think I figured out why I get this weird feeling whenever I look outside the window...   
Surprised - Everything happens at the exact same time as the last, right on the dot. The same person passing by, the same car...   
Sad - And that's pretty scary when you start thinking about it...   
   
Ken Amada   
That figure... It doesn't seem like it wants a direct confrontation.   
But what exactly does it want from us...?   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - You know, Junpei-san never really admits just how sad or hurt he is until it comes to a head.   
Sad - It kind of hit me how mature he can be... Especially considering how he's helped me through some stuff, too.   
Happy - I still think he ought to take things more seriously at times, though.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - I thought I understood how serious of a problem the Shadows are, but maybe it's even worse than I imagined...   
Sad - People getting caught up in accidents, having their minds consumed...   
Sad - What even are the Shadows?

I also wonder about that.   
They're the enemy.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - And it's so weird that only Persona-users stand a chance against them.   
Sad - Do you think Personas and Shadows may be related somehow...?   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Well, yeah, but...   
Sad - Right now, all we're doing is taking them out little by little. Maybe we need to stop and figure out what they really are.   
Sad - That's just a thought, though... It's kind of hard to put it into words.   
   
Ken Amada   
Let's keep going. If there's really an answer to all this, then no doubt it'll be at the very end.   
Happy - That's what I think, at least, so I'll keep pressing forward!   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Maybe... Maybe there really is some kind of secret behind these Personas.   
Sad - Just a little further until we make it to the end... I wonder what we'll find there.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Maybe... Maybe there really is some kind of secret behind these Personas.   
Sad - Same goes for that figure that keeps showing up. Why does Fuuka-san start acting weird whenever we see it...?   
Sad - There's so much we don't know...   
   
Ken Amada   
Looking away - To be honest... I miss him a lot, too.   
Looking away - It's not like I don't want him to come back...   
Sad - But he made his choice, and... I want to try to understand his decision.   
That's why I'll be siding with Sanada-san on this. He feels the same way as I do.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - I'm relieved we're all here, together...   
Sad - I know I chose to split apart and fight for my side, but...   
The fact that we're in this as a team again puts me at ease.   
Happy - Thank you... Aigis-san.   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - I'm still a little mad you didn't say anything about the key possibly being linked to your life, though.   
Angry - No wonder Metis was so determined to win.   
Sad - She'll do anything for the person she cares about the most, even if it means harming others in the process...   
Looking away - And I... I kind of relate to that.   
   
Ken Amada   
Oh, Aigis-san. Do you have some time right now?   
Fuuka-san and I have been using the  we found to keep track of our supplies.   
And I was wondering if you could lend us a hand? If you're okay with it, of course.   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
Should I spend time   
with Amada-san...?   
   
top - SEL_055_0_0   
I think I will.   
Not right now, no.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Thank you!   
Happy - I was actually asked to buy some more supplies, but I don't think I'll be able to carry all of it by myself...   
Happy - So I'm glad you agreed to help.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Oh, okay...   
Then, um... If you find the time, could you come see me?   
   
Ken Amada   
Aigis-san, do you have a moment?   
It's about the  we found. Something's been bugging me...   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Thank you.   
Do you remember how it was in tatters? I think it was just an ordinary mystery book, but...   
I was thinking about fixing it up. I'm pretty confident I can do it.   
Sad - ...At least, I think I can.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Oh, okay. Well, in that case...   
Let's work on it together whenever you have time. Just let me know if you're free.   
   
Ken Amada   
Oh, Aigis-san.   
Remember that book we found while exploring? Could I talk about it with you?

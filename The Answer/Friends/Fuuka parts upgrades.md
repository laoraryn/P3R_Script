Excuse me, Aigis... Would it be okay if I got a closer look at the parts you found while exploring?

Fuuka Yamagishi
...It's just as I speculated. These parts can be equipped to Aigis's framework.
This new base material is much lighter than her current hardware's. It also has different thermal properties and structural durability.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Hey, Aigis.
I think these parts will allow you to do things that would have been impossible before.
Would you like me to install them? I'd understand if you were hesitant, though...

I leave it in your hands.
I don't know...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Okay! You can count on me.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Yeah, again, I completely understand how you must feel, but please trust me on this.
Happy - I think I've gotten plenty familiar with your internal mechanism by now. You think so, too, right?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - All right, then. This would also be a good time to do some maintenance, so why don't we head to your room?

Aigis - Thoughts
Fuuka-san installed the new parts...

Fuuka Yamagishi
I adjusted your mobility unit and power output to improve overall stability. Now you should have a wider range of movement.
That'll make transitioning from running to attacking smoother, which should be more energy efficient.

You can now perform **Ambush**!

Fuuka Yamagishi
So... What do you think?

top - SEL_013_0_0
I quite like it.
It's incredible!
I'm eager to test it out.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - I'm glad you like it!
Happy - Just let me know if you find any more parts. Then I can install them for you!

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
You found more parts, right? Would you like to have them installed?

===============================================================================================

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Okay, everything looks great! I'm sure you'll be able to make good use of this enhancement, Aigis!

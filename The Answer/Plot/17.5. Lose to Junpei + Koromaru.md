Aigis - Thoughts   
I can't get up...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Aigis... Metis... Sorry about that.   
   
Koromaru   
Sad - *whine*   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Let's go, Koromaru. We gotta do this our way.   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
Fix the past or accept the present...   
Which path should I have chosen?   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
Or... Was there another possibility...?   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
Regardless, I can't make   
that choice anymore...   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
My consciousness is fading...

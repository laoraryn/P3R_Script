Stern-Faced Bodyguard
So this is Tartarus from the inside...
This is only the second time anyone has come here without special equipment.

Normal weaponry is useless against Shadows. Anything you brought provides little more than peace of mind.
Everyone here has had their potential developed in our labs. That alone should suffice for protection.
Though should you get devoured, that would provide us with valuable data as well, heheheh...

Stern-Faced Bodyguard
Ugh... Is there anyone left in the Ergo Division who isn't a psycho?

Stern-Faced Bodyguard
In any case, sir...
Are you all right with this? I mean... with bringing your daughter here.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I don't mind at all. I myself requested to come along.

Takeharu Kirijo
...You heard her.

Stern-Faced Bodyguard
...My apologies, sir. I overstepped.

Downcast Bodyguard
......

Stern-Faced Bodyguard
Hey, what's wrong...?

Downcast Bodyguard
Ngh... Agh...
Aaagh! Gaaaaaah!

Stern-Faced Bodyguard
Wh-What the...!?

Middle-Aged Researcher
Eugh...! It appears we need to conduct further research in artificially developing the potential.

Stern-Faced Bodyguard
Both of you, stand back!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Very angry* - So that's... a Shadow.

Stern-Faced Bodyguard
You little—!

Stern-Faced Bodyguard
Sir! Miss!

Takeharu Kirijo
Gah...!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Very angry* - Father!

Middle-Aged Researcher
Did you see that!? Incredible, absolutely incredible! Such power!
It's a Persona! I was right! People can use them!

Takeharu Kirijo
Mitsuru!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Looking away - Father... I'm glad... you're safe...

Middle-Aged Researcher
That was wonderful, Miss Mitsuru! Of course you would be the first one to awaken your potential naturally!
With this, the future truly does seem bright!

Takeharu Kirijo
Why the hell are you celebrating!?

Takeharu Kirijo
Now Mitsuru will be condemned to a life of atonement...
She'll spend her prime years bound to our vile legacy...
...And you call that "bright."

Mitsuru Kirijo
Looking away - Don't worry, Father... This is what I wanted...
Looking away - I will... protect you...

Takeharu Kirijo
Mitsuru...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - That was Senpai's...

Mitsuru Kirijo
Looking away - Hm...? Oh, yes... Well...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Senpai...? What's the matter?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Looking away - I'm sorry, it's... It's just that...
Looking away - Seeing my father, as if he were still alive, was...

Yukari Takeba
Sad - Senpai...

Junpei Iori
Happy - Awww... Wasn't Kirijo-senpai just so gosh darn cute when she was younger?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Happy - Excuse me, Iori? Are you saying that's no longer the case?

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Er, no, that's not what I— I-I mean, you're just so... y'know! C'mon, cut a guy some slack here!

Metis
...It's just as I thought.

Metis
Of the past events we've seen up to this point...
The first one seemed to be about getting ready for battle, but the others... How should I put it...?
There seems to be some aspect they all have in common.
Don't you all get that feeling, too? At least... a little bit?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Just a little bit, yes...

Metis
We've reached the fifth door now...
We should be getting closer to the source...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Very angry* - Oh... I just remembered! There's something I have to tell you all!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Remember the equipment and documents Kirijo-senpai found?
I looked into them, and it turns out they were things that the chairman hid when he was still alive...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Sad - Most of them were from the accident about ten years ago. He must have hidden them to keep them from being destroyed.
Sad - ...And some of the notes seem to mention the Abyss of Time.

Akihiko Sanada
Angry - They do!?

Fuuka Yamagishi
It won't be long before we discover what this place really is.

Ken Amada
Feels like we're closing in on the truth...

Aigis
Then we should press on.

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Aigis... Here.   
I know that you'll do what's best for everyone, so I'm with you all the way.   
   
Aigis   
This must be... the true key...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - You're all okay!   
   
Aigis   
This may sound strange, given the circumstances, but... I'm so glad you're all safe.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Ha... Yeah...   
So...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - You really... don't want to go back...?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Wh— Hey!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - I want him back...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Crying - I want him back! I don't care about anything else! I just want him to come back!   
Crying - I tried... so hard to be strong, and to look forward, and just accept it all, but...   
Crying - I can't... I can't do it! I just can't!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - ......   
   
Ken Amada   
Crying - Yukari-san...   
Crying - That's not...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - I made him a promise, too...   
Looking away - I told him I'd do my best to change this world, so people would stop wishing for the Fall...   
Looking away - That's why I wanted to move on from the past and just focus on the future...   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Yukari-san...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Crying - But...   
Crying - That was just a promise to myself, not to him... So it... It can't end like that!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yukari...   
It's hard... Unbearably hard. But if you don't face that pain, it will never heal.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very angry* - So, what, if I face it, it'll suddenly be okay?   
Very angry* - I'll just accept that he's gone, or forget all about it?   
Very angry* - That won't happen!   
Very angry* - All of us should know by now... That never happens!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You face your pain because it'll never truly go away.   
Yukari... Would you help me fulfill the promise I made to him?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - What...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looking away - It was more a promise to myself, like yours.   
Looking away - He... taught me so much. And showed me so many things that I've come to treasure.   
Looking away - But before I could thank him... He was gone.   
Looking away - The regret was... suffocating. So, I promised myself...   
Looking away - I would always be there for the ones I care about, and fight to protect them, no matter the cost.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
And you're someone I care about, Yukari.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - What...? Me?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You may not have thought much of it, but to me...   
Last year, when you refused to give up on me and gave me something to fight for again... I will never forget that.   
So this time, I... We... want to be here for you.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Mitsuru-senpai, I...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The pain of losing someone close to you is terrible... But you don't have to hold it in.   
And, Yukari... You've kept yours locked up for too long.   
You've been trying so hard to push forward... that you never stopped to grieve.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Ah... Ah...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's all right. We're here for you. Your friends are here for you.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Crying - Ah... Ahh... Aaaahhhhhhhhhh!   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Yukari-san... I want him to come back too.   
Sad - But... I stopped to think about everything, like you told us to.   
Sad - And I realized something... So please, I'd like you to listen.   
   
Aigis   
I want to know what exactly he did... in that moment he used his power.   
We still aren't entirely sure what really happened to him.   
I think we should know that before making a choice... So I won't use the key just yet.   
This is the answer I arrived at... after learning everyone else's feelings.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Huh... "What really happened"...   
   
Ken Amada   
I agree. We should know the whole story before acting.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Sounds good to me!   
But, uh... Can we even do that?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'm not sure... All the doors to the past are gone, except the one to his room...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There's actually one more, remember? We've been using it this whole time.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - That's right... The door to Paulownia Mall!   
   
Aigis   
"The doors reflect the minds of those who pass through"...   
If we wish strongly enough to look into the past, that door should allow us to do so.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I see... It would certainly be worth a try.   
   
Aigis   
Is something wrong?   
   
Metis   
Sad - I was just thinking... I don't really have a reason to be here...   
Sad - And I... I did some horrible things to you all, so... I shouldn't go with you...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Dude, what're you even talkin' about?   
Happy - We got ourselves into this mess! None of this is on you.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Yeah, it's our own fault we got trapped here, and for squabbling with each other too.   
Happy - You're sticking with us, whether you like it or not.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Don't you remember? I told you I won't leave you behind.   
   
Metis   
Happy - Ah...!   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Now that I think about it, it's pretty lucky there's still that one door left, huh?   
Happy - It almost seems too good to be a coincidence.   
   
Metis   
Huh... Actually, that is unusual...   
   
Metis   
If its purpose was to prepare everyone for battle, why is it still here?   
We have the true key, so the fighting should be over. But the door hasn't disappeared...   
So then... Does it have another purpose...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I suppose it would make sense...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If that door hasn't fulfilled its purpose of preparing us for combat...   
Perhaps there's still an enemy for us to defeat...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Our own feelings were the cause of this situation...   
And Aigis's proposal would take us to the source of that pain.   
I wouldn't be surprised to find something waiting for us there.   
   
Aigis   
Angry - ......   
   
Metis   
Sad - So... What should we do? Come up with another plan?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - If there is something there... that's even more reason for us to go.   
Angry - That's what I think.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Then this should be our final battle.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Ha, that sounds familiar... Feels like January again.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - I wonder what is waiting for us... Another large Shadow, maybe?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
No point thinking about it. We just gotta beat it, no matter what it is.   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - That's right! And I'll support you all as best as I can!   
   
Aigis   
Angry - Okay, then...   
Angry - When we work together, there's nothing we can't do. Now, let's go!   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
There's only one door left...   
The door leading to Paulownia   
Mall... We should get on our way.

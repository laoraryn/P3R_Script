Yukari Takeba   
So, you're here.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Yukari-chan...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - You thought about what I said, didn't you? I can see it in your face.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - I did.   
Happy - I understand what you meant now.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
There are four lit flames... Then the victors of this battle will be awarded the true key.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
So, Aigis... Have you decided which choice you would make?   
   
Aigis   
I can't go back to the past yet. So I won't give up this key.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I see... Then it appears we are in opposition.   
   
Aigis   
Yes.   
Sad - I won't give up on what's important to me. It may be painful... But I will stand by my choice.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - I understand now thanks to her.   
   
Metis   
Sister...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - You know... All of this may've actually been for the best.   
Happy - You've been acting so empty and mechanical lately, like when we first met.   
Happy - I actually thought you were just gonna hand over your key 'cause you didn't want to fight.   
Happy - But what you just said... It's like you're alive again.   
Happy - Which means we'll both be giving it our all, right?   
   
Aigis   
Angry - Yes. And I'm ready to prove it.   
Angry - I feel just as strongly about him as everyone else.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - All right, then... Guess we're done talking.   
Very angry* - And I'm not giving up on what's important to me either!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very angry* - You better be ready... 'Cause I'll do whatever it takes to win!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Let both sides give it their all. No holds barred!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - This is it... You can do it, Aigis!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - It's gonna take a lot more than that!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hurt - Don't think it'll be so easy!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very angry* - I'm not down yet... I won't go down!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You're strong... Just as expected.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hurt - Impressive... But I'll fight to the bitter end!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Very angry* - Ha... There's a fire in your eyes. Let's see whose resolve burns brighter!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Mitsuru-senpai!   
Very angry* - Gotta push past the pain... I'm still not done!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hurt - Yukari... Don't worry, I'll carry on your will!

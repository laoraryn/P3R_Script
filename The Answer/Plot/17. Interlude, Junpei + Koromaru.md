Aigis   
Very angry* - Sanada-san! Amada-san!   
   
Aigis   
What just...!?   
   
Metis   
They paid the price for losing.   
   
Metis   
They're still alive. They just won't return to normal until the true key is forged.   
But... If the fires burn out, they won't come back, even after forging the key.   
   
Aigis   
Angry - Is that why you brought us all here?   
Angry - So I couldn't stop fighting once I started?   
   
Metis   
Sad - I... I had no choice! If you don't fight, they'll take your key! I can't let you die!

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - "Die"...!?   
Very angry* - Aigis, what does she mean!? You'd tell us about something like that, right!?   
   
Aigis   
Sad - I... didn't think anyone else should know.   
Sad - Everyone is doing what they feel is best... for him...   
Sad - They don't need to worry about what might happen to me too.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Aigis, no...   
   
Metis   
Sad - This is why you...! You have to...   
   
Metis   
Anyway... I'm sure this is what I was meant to do.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - ......   
   
Metis   
Um... Sister...?   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Don't call me that...   
Sad - You're not my sister.   
   
Metis   
Sad - Do you... hate me now?   
   
Aigis   
Sad - ......   
   
Metis   
Sad - But... That doesn't matter. You're still more important to me than anything...   
Sad - So I won't stop... even if you hate me for it.   
   
Metis   
I will protect you... no matter what.   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
The battle has begun...   
I need to save my defeated friends...   
So I have no choice but to keep fighting.

Koromaru   
Sad - *whine*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Junpei-kun... Koro-chan...   
   
Aigis   
Sad - ......   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - So... I think I mostly get what's goin' on.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - That's... what happens to the losers, huh?   
   
Metis   
That's correct.   
And no one's taking my sister's key... no matter who we have to beat.   
   
Junpei Iori   
That's what I expected from li'l sis, but... Aigis, what about you?   
You wanna redo the past, or move forward?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh... Well, I didn't exactly make a choice myself, but I've been thinking...   
The past or the present... I dunno, I feel like that's the wrong way to look at it.   
And maybe... Maybe the problem's us for seein' it that way.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - I mean, just look at us! Beatin' each other down 'cause we can't agree.   
Happy - Do we really got what it takes to go back and make an even better future?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Looking away - What if we end up makin' a worse future instead?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Huh...!?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Looking away - Look, I get that we don't got much time.   
Looking away - But if we rush this fightin' each other, no question we're gettin' a worse future.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Scheming - So, this is my choice, and I'm standin' by it all the way...   
Scheming - If we gotta fight anyway, then I'll just knock some sense into all of ya! That's the best I got.   
Happy - Heh... If he was here... I bet he'd know what to do.   
   
Metis   
......   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Junpei-san...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Scheming - Sorry, Aigis, but you can't be the one movin' on to the finals if you don't even know what you wanna do.   
Scheming - So I gotta do it myself, no matter how tough it gets.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Scheming - Ha... Thanks, Koromaru.   
Scheming - Alright, I'm ready! Let's get this show on the road!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Scheming - No hard feelings, 'kay? So don't hold anything back!   
   
Koromaru   
Woof!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - This is wrong... There has to be another way!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Scheming - You're pretty tough, Ai-chan. But so am I!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Man, it hurts gettin' hit by you so much more this time... But I'm not out yet!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hurt - Damn, that's some serious firepower... But I'm not losin'!   
   
Koromaru   
Angry - Woof! Woof!   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
Koromaru-san seems to   
have energy to spare...   
   
Koromaru   
Angry - Grrrrr...   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
Koromaru-san is getting worn out.   
   
Koromaru   
Sad - *whimper*   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
Koromaru-san looks like he's in pain...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Looking away - Sorry I dragged you into this, boy... Don't worry, I'll fight enough for both of us!   
   
Koromaru   
Angry - Awooooooooo!   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
Koromaru-san's fighting   
spirit has been reignited...!

Young Officer   
Well, Sergeant?   
   
Veteran Officer   
Eh, you can go. Just another one of 'em freak accidents.   
   
Veteran Officer   
Hey, kid. Sorry I took so long.   
Says here your name's... Ken Amada. Is that right?   
   
Veteran Officer   
Er... Geez... Sorry about what happened to your mom.   
Heard she gave her life to protect you from the wreckage.   
   
Ken Amada   
Looking away - ......   
   
Veteran Officer   
Anyway, I gotta take your statement—since you're a witness and all.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - If I told you what happened... would you believe me?   
   
Veteran Officer   
Of course I would! Helping people out is our job.   
   
Ken Amada   
Looking away - My mom was... murdered.   
   
Veteran Officer   
...What?   
   
Ken Amada   
Looking away - Around midnight, when I got up to use the bathroom... I heard voices by the door...   
Looking away - I looked and saw this teenager, holding his head and yelling...   
   
Veteran Officer   
Hold on, you're saying he did it? But the whole house collapsed!   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - There was this shining, horse-like monster that came right out of him!   
Looking away - It roared, and just like that, my mom and my house were—   
   
   
Veteran Officer   
Ohhh, a monster, was it? Haha... C'mon now, there's no way that actually happened.   
Oh, um, sorry, I shouldn't laugh... It's just, sometimes after a traumatic incident like this, people can—   
   
   
Ken Amada   
Very angry* - I'm not lying! I really did see it, I did!   
   
Veteran Officer   
Look, kid... It was all an accident, plain and simple. A drunk driver crashed his car into your house.   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - What...? A car crash...?   
   
Veteran Officer   
We've already found the car and what's left of the driver. Now all we need is an account of the accident.

Ken Amada   
Very angry* - That's a lie! You're just making that up!   
   
Veteran Officer   
I know you might think so, but... It's true.   
   
Officer Outside   
Sergeant, can you come out here?   
   
Veteran Officer   
Yeah, be right there!   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - Wait! I really did see it!   
   
Veteran Officer   
Listen, I'm sorry for your loss, but... I have to go, uh... I hope things get better.   
   
Ken Amada   
Looking away - Liar... You said you'd believe me!   
   
Ken Amada   
Looking away - ......   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - Adults can't be trusted.   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - So I'll find him myself...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Surprised - The door's gone...   
Surprised - But the first door didn't disappear. It just opened up to a new place...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Never mind that. What we just saw was...   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - ...That sure brings back memories.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - All I thought of back then was finding my mom's murderer, but in the end, I couldn't manage it on my own.   
Sad - All I could do was ask myself why he had special powers... and if things would've turned out differently if I had them, too.   
Looking away - Maybe that night... was the reason I started experiencing the Dark Hour.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Looking away - Amada...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looking away - My family must have fabricated the "accident" as a cover-up.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looking away - ...I'm sorry for that.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Very angry* - Hey, Metis! What was that all about!?   
   
Metis   
Surprised - What was what about...? Oh, I see.   
Happy - Apparently, we can only witness past events if not everyone was involved in the first place... That's new.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Very angry* - That's not what I meant! Why did we see such a painful memory!?   
   
Metis   
Angry - Huh? How would I know? It's your past.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - You better not be hiding anything.   
   
Metis   
Angry - How would I benefit from that?   
This is just speculation, but I think the doors reflect the minds of those who pass through.   
That's why we were able to find a place to acquire supplies and return to the dorm directly.   
   
Metis   
Right now, you wish to erase the Abyss of Time as soon as possible and make it out alive, correct?   
If so, then although what's beyond these doors may seem irrelevant, there might be a reason we're seeing it.   
   
Metis   
Angry - Perhaps your time would be better spent thinking about that reason rather than accusing me.

Akihiko Sanada   
Very angry* - What did you say!?   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - It's all right, really. What she's saying... is probably true.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Amada...   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - I've been doing a lot of thinking lately...   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Back then, things weren't perfect, but everything seemed so much more... straightforward, when we were fighting.   
Sad - That feeling we all shared just wasn't something you can get by going to school every day.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sanada-san, recently you've dedicated yourself to boxing again, right?   
Isn't that because... you don't want to forget that feeling?   
...Or maybe I'm just projecting.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - ......   
Sad - ...No, I think you're right.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Why don't we just drop the subject?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - There's no point in dredging up the past...   
Angry - Don't you remember why we put everything on the line?   
Angry - If we stop moving forward, then this all would be a waste of time.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looking away - Yukari...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...C'mon, let's go.   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
For what reason did we witness   
a vision of our friend's past...?

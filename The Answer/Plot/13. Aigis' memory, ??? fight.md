Is this... the deepest part of the Abyss of Time...?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - You think so? Looks the same as everywhere else to me...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It would make sense, considering the path we've taken.   
And that means the source of the Abyss, and therefore the time loop, should be here.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh, I almost forgot! Speaking of the Abyss...   
Sad - I found something in those notes about it that I mentioned earlier.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You did?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
They said that this place came to be as a reaction to the creation of Tartarus.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - A "reaction"...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Yes, because a giant tower appeared out of nowhere, it ended up leaving a massive hollow in its place—that's the Abyss.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
So they've known about this place for ten years?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - They thought that it would be harmless if left alone, and that it would probably disappear when Tartarus did.   
Exasperated* - But the notes also said that since the Abyss is just a byproduct of Tartarus, there shouldn't be any Shadows in it...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Horrified - Seriously!? Uh, counterpoint: there's a shitload of Shadows here!   
Angry - And if it was supposed to go poof along with Tartarus, then why're we standin' in it?   
Angry - They forget a decimal place or somethin'?   
   
Metis   
No, their logic makes sense.   
But some kind of force prevented it from vanishing, so the other side's disappearance caused an imbalance...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - What could that force be?   
   
Metis   
Who knows? Maybe it's down here somewhere.   
But one thing's for certain: it's deeply connected to all of you...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - The hell's up with that!? What'd we do to deserve this!?   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - Well, there's another door...   
Angry - If it is down here, then maybe...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - So whatever's past that could be what's causing all this?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - If we leave out Aigis, Metis, and me... Whose past is left?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Yeah... Gotta be someone else with a "reason" for their power, right?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Well, there's no point wasting time thinking about it. It's literally right there.   
Let's just open it, then we'll know.   
   
Metis   
Angry - Whatever the cause is, it's strong enough to keep the Abyss of Time from disappearing...   
Angry - And we'll be trying to destroy it.   
Angry - We could be in for a battle. We should make sure we're prepared for that.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
She's right.   
This is where we aim to settle everything...   
And I know we can do this.

Sad - ......   
   
Aigis   
Sad - I...   
Sad - I... am...   
Sad - ......   
   
Aigis   
Huh...!?   
   
Aigis   
Angry - You...!?   
   
Aigis   
Angry - Wait!   
   
Aigis   
Very angry* - Please, wait!   
   
Aigis   
Hurt - Ah...   
   
Aigis   
Hurt - No, don't go!   
   
Aigis   
Sad - I... promised to protect you...   
Sad - I dedicated my entire existence to it...   
Sad - But... I can't fulfill my purpose now...   
   
Aigis   
Sad - There's nothing I can do anymore...   
Sad - Is there anything left for me to live for...?   
Upset - Is there... a meaning to any of it...?   
Upset - ......   
   
Aigis   
Closed eyes, concentrating - If this is what it's like now... then I... I wish I could just be a simple machine again...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Aigis   
Sad - ......   
   
Aigis   
Sad - I...   
Sad - I... am...   
Sad - ......   
   
Aigis   
Huh...!?   
   
Aigis   
Angry - You...!?   
   
Aigis   
Angry - Wait!   
   
Aigis   
Very angry* - Please, wait!   
   
Aigis   
Hurt - Ah...   
   
Aigis   
Hurt - No, don't go!   
   
Aigis

===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - So... That was...   
Surprised - That was the cause?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Horrified - Uh, don't look at me...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Well, um...   
Sad - I was glad to be able to see him again. Even if it was just from behind...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Indeed...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - ......   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That was obviously Aigis's memory just now... But what's it mean?   
I guess that was supposed to be her reason for awakening? But she already had a Persona.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - She didn't awaken to that one... She awakened to the Persona abilities that he had.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Aigis, what was that memory? And when did it happen?   
   
Aigis   
Sad - ......   
Sad - It's... where I would always wake up.   
Sad - It was so painful losing him... I couldn't bring myself to do anything, so... I just hid in my room.   
Sad - For a while, I did nothing but chase after him in my dreams...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Oh, Aigis...   
   
Metis   
Sister...   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Eventually, I stopped having dreams at all.   
Sad - It felt like the weight on my chest was lightening... until it was lifted entirely.   
Sad - What we saw just now... must have been the last time I had that dream.   
Sad - But honestly, I don't know why that would be my "reason"...   
   
Metis   
Sister... Are you still in pain?   
The person we saw in your dream... He's the one with the same power as you, isn't he?   
   
Aigis   
......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - So that's what's supposed to have caused all this?   
Angry - How? None of this makes sense!   
   
Metis   
Angry - You still don't get it?   
Angry - We only saw it in my sister's memory... but all of you want to see him again, right?   
Angry - If that's the case... then the conclusion is simple.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - What are you saying?   
   
Metis   
I guess what I said at the beginning was right after all...   
Eliminating all of you... would have been the fastest way to solve this.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - So... That figure we keep seeing...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Very angry* - Wait, something's wrong...!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - What the...!?   
   
Metis   
Angry - Just as I thought...   
Angry - A monster is coming... Your regrets themselves, given form.   
   
Aigis   
Angry - Is that...!?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - No way... Are you shittin' me!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - What!? That was my—   
   
   
Junpei Iori   
Horrified - And that's mine! Whoa—!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Very angry* - What the hell is this thing!?   
   
Metis   
Angry - It's the cause of everything...   
Angry - The Abyss of Time not disappearing, Shadows being present within it...   
Angry - What you see now is a being of your own creation.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - So... This is the form of our regrets...   
   
Aigis   
Very angry* - Athena...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - How is it using Isis...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Very angry* - Artemisia too!?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Trismegistus... Stop it! You can't use him!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Very angry* - The hell...? Even Caesar!?   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - There's Kala-Nemi... But how...?   
   
Koromaru   
Angry - Grrr!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - Koro-chan looks mad!

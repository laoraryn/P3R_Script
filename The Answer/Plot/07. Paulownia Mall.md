Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Huh? This is... Paulownia Mall?
Surprised - But we were just in...

Akihiko Sanada
Surprised - What's going on? Did we make it out somehow?

Junpei Iori
Sad - I dunno... Something seems off.

Junpei Iori
Sad - Also... Isn't it kinda hot?

Officer Kurosawa
You kids...?

Akihiko Sanada
Oh, Kurosawa-san.

Officer Kurosawa
What're you doing out here on a weekday? Shouldn't you be in school?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Oh, but it's spring break...

Officer Kurosawa
Spring break? That was a couple months ago. It's July now.

Officer Kurosawa
And what's with the getup? You all headed somewhere, or...?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Oh, um, no! We're just, uh...

Officer Kurosawa
...Well, I'll let it slide since you kids are a little different.
Don't think I'll always turn a blind eye, though. If you're up to something, you won't get off scot-free. Are we clear?

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - Geez...

Mitsuru Kirijo
All the dates displayed here say 2009... That calendar, too.
So when he said it's July, did he mean... July of last year?

Akihiko Sanada
That's impossible... Are you saying this is the past?

Akihiko Sanada
Hey, Aigis's sister!

Akihiko Sanada
Very angry* - Hey! Are you listening!?

Aigis
Are the things here that interesting to you...?

Metis
Surprised - N-No, not at all.
It's all normal, everyday stuff, right? This is a "fountain," and that over there is a "store"...

Aigis
Happy - Well, I come here to gaze at the fountain myself from time to time...

Metis
Happy - R-Really? You do the same—


Aigis
Sad - But there is something mysterious about this place—for all of us, not just you.
Tell me, what is this place?

Metis
Sad - ...We got here by passing through a door, remember?
Sad - Doors like that are located throughout the Abyss of Time, each of them connected to the past.

Akihiko Sanada
Surprised - Then... This really is last year!?

Metis
How else can you explain the different time and season?
But it seems you can't just go anywhere in the past... Only somewhere from your memories.
I don't think this place connects to anywhere else, either.

Junpei Iori
Surprised - Seriously? The past? Aw, man...

Metis
We're lucky to have ended up here. Let's use this time to gather supplies.
Whatever we get here should be usable until the Abyss of Time disappears.

Metis
Perhaps that's why the door led us here in the first place...
It may have reflected your inner thoughts.

Ken Amada
Surprised - She seems to be taking this pretty well... It's all so mind-boggling to me, though.

Aigis
......

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - Well, on the bright side... At least we won't starve now.

Aigis - Thoughts
...And that was how we learned why
the Abyss of Time was called as such.
It was a place where one
could revisit bygone days.
But looking back on it now, that wasn't
the only thing that astounded us.
Maybe we all subconsciously
sensed some sort of salvation...

===============================================================================================

Aigis
Huh...? Is this—!?

Metis
Surprised - Oh wow, I didn't think we'd emerge here instead of the Desert of Doors...
Surprised - But I guess it's not completely improbable since this place seems to be fully connected to the Abyss of Time now.
Maybe it was influenced by everyone thinking of making frequent supply trips.
Happy - In any case, this will certainly make it easier to go back and forth.

Junpei Iori
Helloooooo! Yo, li'l sis, what's with the holdup?

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - No way... Seriously?

Akihiko Sanada
Hey, keep it moving! The rest of us need to get through, too.

Aigis - Thoughts
Though we secured a means
to acquire supplies, we remain
trapped in the dorm.
What awaits us further
inside the labyrinth?

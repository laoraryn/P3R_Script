...And that's all for the weather. At the tone, the time will be 12 AM.   
   
Newscaster   
Good evening.   
It is now April 1st. Here are the latest news reports...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hm? What...?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
When did we... fall asleep?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Huh? This is the dorm. Is everything back to normal?   
   
Koromaru   
Woof, woof!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Mm... What is it, Koromaru?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Huh...? What happened?   
Surprised - Weren't we all by the entrance, talking about a key or something?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah, we were... But it looks like that's been settled.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Everything outside is back to normal. We're no longer blocked from leaving, either.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - So the Abyss of Time is gone, then.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - The date... It's April 1st!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - So... It's all over then, right?   
   
Junpei Iori   
[cut 3 1 0]   
   
Junpei Iori   
Very happy* - Aw, hell yeah! About damn time!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Hey, Aigis, wake up. We made it out in one piece!   
Happy - Aigis?   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Wait a second...   
Sad - After we used the key to open the front door, we ended up in a room that looked like an elevator...   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - And while we were there, Aigis-san...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Hey, c'mon, Aigis! You're not gonna lie there forever, are you? Wake up!   
Angry - Aigis!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Kirijo-senpai...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Let's not jump to conclusions.   
We'll take her to her room for now. We can use the equipment there to check on her condition.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Looking away - She's not waking up...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - How's it looking, Fuuka?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I'm on it. I've used this equipment a number of times before...   
Sad - It should be designed to allow us to operate the most basic systems on our own.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looking away - ...No good. If only it wasn't so late at night...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looking away - I'm sorry. I tried contacting the lab, but they're unlikely to send help anytime soon.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - It's okay. I think I've almost got it...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Is that it?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - Her vitals are onscreen now! Let's see...   
Very angry* - ......   
Very angry* - No... This can't be...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Did you find something?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Her synaptic circuits... They're completely burned out...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - There must have been a massive system overload that took her way over capacity.   
Sad - I imagine it's related to her gaining the ability to use multiple Personas...   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - Burned out? But... She can be fixed, right?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - It would be easy enough to replace the necessary parts, but...   
Sad - The Aigis we know is already... gone.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - No...   
Sad - Aigis...   
   
Aigis   
Faceplate down - Mm...   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Did you... call my name?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Horrified - Aigis!   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Um... Did something happen?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Geez! Way to give us a heart attack, you sleepyhead!   
Sad - You took so long to wake up, we thought you were dead...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - But... How?   
Surprised - Her synaptic circuits shouldn't even be receiving power anymore...   
Surprised - It's almost like... she's really alive.   
   
Aigis   
Um, I'm sorry if I caused you all concern.   
I was... having a dream. The first one in quite some time.   
It was full of memories of the time I spent with everyone... and...   
   
Aigis   
"Strength of heart, when united, is barred by no door"...   
   
Aigis   
Happy - It's nothing.   
Happy - Painful goodbyes may be one of the most difficult aspects of living...   
Happy - But I believe that spending time with those who care about you is one of the most joyous.   
Happy - I... really am lucky to have such wonderful friends.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Aigis...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - We were right next to each other, suffering over the exact same things...   
Happy - Looking back, I feel kinda stupid. Why did we ever think we were all alone?   
Happy - I guess we're more alike than we thought.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Man... Is this nightmare finally over? We're not gonna wake up and see April 1st again, are we?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hey, quit tempting fate, would you?   
Happy - In any case... That's it for now.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Aw, crap... With the danger gone, I feel like I'm gonna pass out! I could practically sleep standing up...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh... Junpei-kun!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - All right... Let's head back to our rooms and get some rest for tonight.   
Happy - Was there anything else to take care of before we turn in?   
......   
Actually, there is one thing I'd like to announce.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
With regard to collecting everyone's Evokers... I'd like to reverse that decision.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
This whole incident gave me a lot to think about.   
In a way, I may have been trying to bury the past by collecting the symbols of our power and locking them away.   
But even with no Shadows left to fight, we remain in a battle against ourselves.   
So... Everyone should hold onto their own.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Until the day when everyone can change...   
Very happy* - ...Right?

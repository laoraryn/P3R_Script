Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - What's going on!?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Horrified - The hell're these cracks in the floor!?   
   
Metis   
Angry - This is bad... It's becoming unstable...   
Angry - We still have time, but not much.   
Angry - If these fissures reach the door, we might not be able to leave even with the keys...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Tch... It's just one thing after another, isn't it?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - So, uh... Guess we gotta decide what to do with these keys, huh?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - ......   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Um, well...   
Sad - I want to stay in the present. I think that's what he would've wanted, too.   
   
Junpei Iori   
"What he would've wanted," huh...?   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - I've been thinking... He died so suddenly, and they never even figured out the cause.   
Sad - I get the feeling that he... He must've given his life to make some kind of miracle happen.   
Sad - He thought about it, weighed his options... and ultimately chose to leave this world to us.   
   
Metis   
"Died"...? "Miracle"...?   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - That's why... personally... I don't want to just undo his decision.   
Sad - I want to... respect his sacrifice.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Oh, Amada-kun...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'm with Amada.   
We all saw the resolve it takes to face death head-on and accept it...   
That resolve, and what it brought about...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Even if it hurts, we have to accept it too. That's how we honor his memory.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yukari, what about you?   
   
Junpei Iori   
You're all about the here and now, right, Yuka-tan?   
"You gotta look forward!" That's practically your motto, ain't it?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - I...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - I... want to go back.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Yeah, I always tell myself to look forward and let go of the past.   
Angry - But... This is different. We might be able to change something... We can't pass that up!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yukari...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
So you'd take away his choice for your own?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
[cut 2 2 1]   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very angry* - That's not what I said!   
Very angry* - We can actually change the past! What's wrong with wanting that!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Then let me ask you... If you prevented your father's death, what would happen?   
The people you've met, what you've gone through with them... It'd all be gone. And you wouldn't be the person you are now.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - It's the same for Shinji and Miki... I wouldn't erase their deaths either.   
Sad - Every single thing about my past is important... Because it all shaped who I am.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - But that's not even—!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Guys, guys! Let's all take it down a notch, okay?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very angry* - "Take it down a notch"? Are you kidding!?   
Angry - If anything, we're not taking this seriously enough! We can save him from dying!   
Angry - Don't you want to bring him back!?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Of course I want him back!   
Angry - But is yellin' at each other like this really gonna solve anything!?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Looking away - And think about it... If we go back, we'd have to face Nyx again.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - What, so you're just afraid to fight?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - No! I'm... Well... I am, but...   
Angry - Aghh... I don't know what I'm trying to say, but everyone needs to calm down, alright!?   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Aigis-san, how do you think we should use the keys?   
   
Aigis   
Sad - I, um...   
Sad - The past or the present...? I'm just not sure.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - You seriously won't make a choice?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - The day we said our goodbyes, you were the only one who didn't show up.   
Angry - You got to hear his last words, and now you even have his power...   
Angry - But you still don't know how you feel about him?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Listen... I know it hurts, believe me. It hurts so much, I can't stand it...   
Sad - But...   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Yukari-san, I...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - ...Forget it. Nothing I say will make a difference anyway.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Metis, does everyone have to agree for the keys to combine?   
   
Metis   
Not necessarily. The keys themselves don't have opinions.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
So, in other words, it's possible to take them by force and combine them.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - "By force"...? Are you saying you want to fight!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I don't want to. But if we can't agree, we don't have a choice.   
We're running out of time, and talking hasn't gotten us anywhere.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You have a point...   
This matter concerns the life of a dear friend. I doubt any of us will be easily swayed.   
So in that case...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Wait, Kirijo-senpai...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I had already made my decision—I will stand with Yukari.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Senpai...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You're siding with Takeba? Are you sure?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All right. I guess you've got your reasons and I've got mine.   
   
Metis   
Angry - Well, I'm sticking with my sister! I'll protect her no matter what!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
That makes sense, Metis. You know what's important to you.   
So you understand why I can't back down either, right?   
   
Metis   
Yes.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Everyone, wait! Don't do this!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I made my feelings clear. Now you— No...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Now everyone needs to recognize their own feelings.   
Think about who he was and what he meant to us...   
   
Metis   
We'll need a proper venue for the battles. A place where the results will be absolute...   
   
Metis   
I'll show you the way. Let me know when you're ready.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - We're really... going to fight each other...?   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
My friends are irreconcilably divided...   
What decision will I come to myself...?

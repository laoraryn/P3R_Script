Aigis - Thoughts   
I can't get up...   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - I thought I was prepared for this, but... It still feels awful...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - It does...   
Sad - But we can't stop here. We have to keep fighting for what we believe.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Yeah.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - He gave his life for this world... I won't let anyone dishonor that!   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
Fix the past or accept the present...   
Which path should I have chosen?   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
Or... Was there another possibility...?   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
Regardless, I can't make   
that choice anymore...   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
My consciousness is fading...

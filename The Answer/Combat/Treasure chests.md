Aigis - Thoughts   
The number of s   
I have is ****. Using **** should open it...   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
I used **** of my s,   
so now I have  left.   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
If I had **** s, I could   
open it, but I only have **** right now.   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
I don't have any s   
on hand. It looks like I need **** to open it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I don't sense any more treasure chests here.   
It's still dangerous, so please try to come back as soon as you can.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That looks like it'll be useful. It's up to you to decide how to use it.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Ah, I thought that's what that was.   
Happy - That's a **Twilight Fragment**. They can be used on devices throughout Tartarus.   
You might find more in Tartarus or other locations with traces of Shadows.   
If you come across any going forward, you'll want to take them.

Continue exploring   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Okay.   
Be careful on your way back.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, do you think you might have missed something?   
Well, there are no enemies left, but it's still dangerous.   
Please be careful if you're going to keep exploring.   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
This would've looked good on Aragaki...   
but he isn't here anymore...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It looks like what the chairman gave you before, doesn't it, Arisato-kun?   
It's apparently really rare. I'm surprised to see it in a place like this.   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
Maybe the owner of the antique shop could   
craft it into a piece of equipment for me...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It looks like you've seen everything here. Good job.   
I think it's a good time to leave now. Please exit back out the door.

Happy - Hey, that's a nice-looking bow! I can use it, right?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Yo, that weapon looks beastly! But it'd take a real master like me to make good use of it, so...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Oh, a new weapon, huh? It looks even better than what I'm using right now.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Ah, that looks like a fine weapon. Would you mind if I used it?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh, there was a weapon inside. I think Koro-chan would be able to use that one well.   
   
Aigis   
New armaments acquired. It appears to be an upgrade. I propose a retrofit.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - A new weapon...? May I please use it!?   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Arf! Arf!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Happy - Well, what do we have here? You should let me use it.   
   
Metis   
Surprised - That looks powerful... Please give it to me!   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Oh, we have acquired new armaments! May I use it?   
   
Aigis - Thoughts

Seems useful.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Ooh, that looks great! Whaddaya say? Can I use it?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Hey, sick armor. I think it'd help bring out my inner charm, y'know?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I think this armor would suit me well. Mind if I use it?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - What a splendid piece of armor. I imagine it'd be more effective than what I'm currently using.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh! Don't you think that armor would be perfect for Koro-chan?   
   
Aigis   
It appears to be a defensive article. I recommend allowing me to equip it.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Um, could I use that new armor? Even if it doesn't fit now, I'll definitely grow into it!   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Arf! Arf!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Hey, that's a decent find. I'll hold onto it if nobody's using it.   
   
Metis   
Happy - Whoa, that looks way better than what I'm using now... Can I please have it?   
   
Aigis   
Happy - That armor appears sturdier than my current equipment. Would it be okay if I used it?

I'm no longer getting a signal from the Shadow. It must be fairly far away...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Well, it got the chest, but at least it knows we're here.   
I'm sure it won't be able to ignore us if we keep opening treasure chests.   
So let's keep looking for chests. We just might run into that Shadow again.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I don't sense the Shadow anymore. It's probably pretty far away by now...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - It got the treasure chest... but I think it noticed us.   
We should be able to get its attention if we keep opening chests.   
Let's keep looking for them.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The Shadow's coming our way. Get ready!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The target Shadow has been eliminated. Good work.   
There aren't any Shadows left on this floor. Let's keep moving.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The Shadow's headed straight for us! This is our chance! Are you ready?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It looks like you defeated the Shadow. Good job.   
I'm not sensing any more enemies on this floor. Let's move on.

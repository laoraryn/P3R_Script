What's the situation?

Yes, please.
Not right now.

Mitsuru Kirijo
It's too dangerous to go alone. Come back and choose teammates to fight at your side.

Fuuka Yamagishi
It's not safe to go alone. Please come back and form a party!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Anything could happen. Keep your guard up.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Keep an eye out and be ready for anything.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I don't detect any enemies on this floor. I believe you'll be safe for now.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I don't sense any enemies around. You should be safe on this floor.

Mitsuru Kirijo
The path forward has opened. Exercise caution as you proceed.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Looks like we can keep going.

Mitsuru Kirijo
You should be able to progress further... Could you take a closer look?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Has the path opened up yet? Could you please get closer and check it out?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Looks like you can't progress any further. Let's wait for the right time before we try again.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I don't think it's possible to go any farther than this for now... I guess all we can do now is wait.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Keep a lookout for the enemy that escaped earlier.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Try to look for the enemy that escaped earlier!

Fuuka Yamagishi
What is it?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Do you need my help?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Did you need something?

Mitsuru Kirijo

Fuuka Yamagishi
All right. Are you sure you want to return to the Desert of Doors right now?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Roger that! Then please stay put.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'm sorry, but... it looks like my ability can't be used there.

Fuuka Yamagishi
All right. You want information on this floor, correct?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Okay, I'll run a search and display what information I can find, then.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'm sorry, but... it looks like my ability can't be used there.

Fuuka Yamagishi
We've already gathered all the information we can on this floor, so there's no need for that.

Fuuka Yamagishi
All right. You don't want to be detected by the enemies on this floor, right?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Okay! This won't work on all enemies, so please exercise caution.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'm sorry, but... looks like this won't have any effect there.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Jamming is still in effect, so we don't need to activate it again!

Fuuka Yamagishi
All right. You want to boost your defense and speed, right?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Okay! Just keep in mind that these boons will only take effect in the next battle.

Fuuka Yamagishi
That's still in effect right now, so we don't have to activate it again. It'll show during the next battle!

Fuuka Yamagishi
All right. You want to scare all the enemies on this floor, right?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Okay, here goes nothing!

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'm sorry, but... looks like this won't have any effect there.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I've already used Shock Noise on this floor.
It may not affect any more enemies. Are you sure you want to use it again?

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'm sorry, but I don't have enough energy...

Fuuka Yamagishi
Do you need anything else?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Defeat all the Shadows on the floor.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Since there aren't any enemies at the moment, there's no need to issue that order.
Now's a good time to instruct your party members to split up.

Mitsuru Kirijo
There are no enemies left to defeat. Use the teleporter to return to the entrance.

TRL_TARTARUS_FIRST_TRY_H
DEV: Display help on instructions to split up at this time.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'm worried about the passengers, too. That's why we must secure the monorail immediately.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Fortunately, no one on the monorail was hurt...
But why hasn't the enemy attacked us yet? Does that mean they're not attacking at random?
I'm not sure what the enemy is thinking... so proceed with caution.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Was the enemy waiting for this opportunity?
Angry - It's too dangerous for Iori to be alone! Go after him!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - There's no time! Get to the front!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - I can tell that the monorail has sped up from where I am, too!
Angry - If it gets any faster, there won't be much time left until a collision!
Angry - Concentrate on getting to the front, defeating the enemy, and stopping the train immediately!

Aigis - Thoughts
I can't contact Mitsuru. All I hear is static...

Fuuka Yamagishi
There's an enemy close by. Be careful!

Fuuka Yamagishi
I still sense some enemies nearby. Keep an eye out if you decide to engage them.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Looks like you've defeated all the Shadows on this floor. Please look for the stairs that'll take you up.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Something feels off on the floor above us... If you're going up, proceed with caution.

Fuuka Yamagishi
The target is on the third floor. Please hurry!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Good job. It should be safe for you to return now.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Be careful! There seems to be a Shadow in that room still.
But... where is it?

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'll see what I can find out, so please join up with the others for now.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I sense something similar to a Shadow coming from the mirror.
Please break the mirror!

Fuuka Yamagishi
There should be something different about the mirrors we're looking for... Take a closer look and see if you can find out what it is.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Break any mirror that doesn't show your own reflection!

Fuuka Yamagishi
The seal is broken! Head to the target right away!

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'm picking up two powerful readings from our target somewhere below you...
It's like the two signals are overlapping, forming one giant mass.

Fuuka Yamagishi
The target is heading downward.
Angry - Please go after it!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - The target is waiting at the end.
Angry - Please be careful!

Mitsuru Kirijo
The furthest you've gotten is floor .

Fuuka Yamagishi
I believe the furthest you've gotten is floor .

Fuuka Yamagishi
Happy - We've still got more exploring to do. Let's all do our best!

Fuuka Yamagishi
I believe the furthest you've gotten is floor .

Fuuka Yamagishi
It looks like the furthest you've explored Malebolge is floor .

Fuuka Yamagishi
It looks like the furthest you've explored Cocytus is floor .

Fuuka Yamagishi
It looks like the furthest you've explored Caina is floor .

Fuuka Yamagishi
It looks like the furthest you've explored Antenora is floor .

Fuuka Yamagishi
It looks like the furthest you've explored Ptolomea is floor .

Fuuka Yamagishi
It looks like the furthest you've explored Judecca is floor .

Fuuka Yamagishi
It looks like the furthest you've explored Empyrean is floor .

Fuuka Yamagishi
It looks like you've gone everywhere you can. Great work, Aigis.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Angry - The Reaper has appeared! Retreat immediately!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Angry - The Reaper showed up! Please run!

Mitsuru Kirijo
Surprised - These readings...!? It's getting closer!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Surprised - I sense something powerful, and it's approaching quickly!

Fuuka Yamagishi
There's someone on this floor! Please rescue them!

Fuuka Yamagishi
There's something on this floor. It's... a person? Please look for them!

Fuuka Yamagishi
Looks like one of those doors is on this floor. Maybe we should go look for it.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Something different is happening on this floor. Stay alert.

Fuuka Yamagishi
There's something different about this floor. Please be careful.

Mitsuru Kirijo
The path forward has opened up. Exercise caution as you proceed.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Looks like there's more to this path. Let's keep going.

Mitsuru Kirijo
You should be able to progress further... Could you take a closer look?

Fuuka Yamagishi
Has the path opened up yet? Could you please get closer and check it out?

Mitsuru Kirijo
Looks like you can't progress any further. Let's wait for the right time before we try again.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I don't think it's possible to go any farther than this for now... I guess all we can do now is wait.

Mitsuru Kirijo
The enemy has been annihilated. Let's move on.

Fuuka Yamagishi
You've already defeated the enemy here. Let's get moving!

Mitsuru Kirijo
I sense a powerful enemy up ahead. Make sure you're well-prepared before entering battle.

Fuuka Yamagishi
There's an enemy blocking the path up ahead, and a tough one at that. Get ready for battle.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'm picking up a human presence on the 263rd floor. It must be the last member of Strega.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I sense someone on the 259th floor. I'm positive it's a member of Strega... Please be careful.

Fuuka Yamagishi
We finally did it... We finally conquered this enormous tower.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Looks like the last member of Strega, the leader, is on the 263rd floor.

Fuuka Yamagishi
We've finally made it to the top of Tartarus... where we'll have our final battle.

Mitsuru Kirijo
We've almost reached the end of this area. Let's press on.

Fuuka Yamagishi
We're almost at the end of this area! Just hang on, everyone!

Mitsuru Kirijo
We've made decent progress in this area, but we still have a bit of ground to cover.

Fuuka Yamagishi
You've made it pretty far, but it looks like there's still a long way to go. Everyone, stay focused.

Mitsuru Kirijo
You've defeated the stronger enemies in this area, but there's still a ways to go until you reach the end of it.

Fuuka Yamagishi
You've cleared out all of the powerful enemies in this area. Let's try to get as close as we can to the next area.

Mitsuru Kirijo
There's a strong enemy nearby. Brace yourself for battle.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I sense a strong enemy close by! It might be a good idea to prepare for battle.

Mitsuru Kirijo
I'm getting readings from a strong enemy. We're still far from it, but don't let your guard down.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I sense a strong enemy a little further up... Please take care when exploring.

Mitsuru Kirijo
Looks like it'll be some time until we cross paths with the next strong enemy. Tread carefully.

Fuuka Yamagishi
It'll be a while until we encounter the next strong enemy, but please remain vigilant while exploring.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I sense someone on the 259th floor! I think it's a member of Strega, so please be careful!

Fuuka Yamagishi
I sense a person on the 263rd floor... It must be Takaya. Looks like it's time to settle the score with him.

Fuuka Yamagishi
We're nearly at the top floor... And then it'll be time for our final battle.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I sense something completely new... It doesn't seem to be a Shadow.

Fuuka Yamagishi
It's a huge door... I wonder what we'll find inside.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Please return for now. I'd like to go over the information we have on the door.

Fuuka Yamagishi
The atmosphere here feels different from the usual floors we explore... Please proceed carefully.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Let's investigate the door. Maybe we can figure out what makes this one different from the rest.

Fuuka Yamagishi
The tension is so thick, it's almost suffocating...

Fuuka Yamagishi
I can sense Strega's presence just up ahead. Please proceed with caution.

Fuuka Yamagishi
There's another person on the 263rd floor... It must be the other member of Strega.

Fuuka Yamagishi
Seems like the leader of Strega is just up ahead.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I don't sense any powerful enemies, but keep your guard up all the same.

Fuuka Yamagishi
I'm detecting something... Is it that figure? It's still a fair distance away, though.

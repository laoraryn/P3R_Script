I'm picking up signs of a valuable treasure chest. Collect it if you can.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There seems to be a valuable treasure chest nearby. Do you think you could collect it?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - This floor... There's a locked treasure chest here. Can you try finding and opening it?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I'm getting a reading on a locked treasure chest! It'd be great if we could collect it.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That golden Shadow is in here somewhere... It'll be a good chance to gain a wealth of experience.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It seems a rare Shadow is on this floor! If we can defeat it, it'll surely help level us up.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I can't see as well here... It's difficult for me to follow your readings.   
However, the enemy can't detect you either. I'll keep sending you information, so stay alert.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - The visibility here is rather poor. I can manage to see you all, but barely...   
At least the enemy won't be able to see you. Please stay calm, and you'll pull through!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
This distortion... It seems that door is near. It'll be dangerous, but do you want to head inside?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - I'm getting a reading of that door...! If you're going to go in, then please make sure you're fully prepared.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Three doors... I wonder where they lead.   
Closed eyes, concentrating - Hm...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm detecting Shadows behind each door.   
Starting from the left and going right, the Shadow readings get stronger. But I'm picking up treasure chests with similar signals, too.   
So the leftmost one is the least dangerous, but has the smallest reward. And the rightmost one is the riskiest, with the greatest reward...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It's up to you to decide which way to go, but please keep that information in mind.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm not detecting anything in the immediate area, so we should be okay for now.   
Would you mind investigating those doors?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - MND_Monad04_02   
I suppose I should examine the doors.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Uh, please wait! There are only stairs up ahead.   
Very angry* - I really think we should figure out what's going on, so please come back for now.

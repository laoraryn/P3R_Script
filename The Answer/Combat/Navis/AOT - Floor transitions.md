I'm ready.   
Just a moment.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Some members are in battle. Do you want to proceed without them?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I see. Then we'll continue on and rendezvous with them later.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Some of our team members are still fighting. Will you continue without them?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
All right. Well then, let's keep going!   
We'll meet up with them later.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
There seems to be a person on this floor. Will you leave without them?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right, let's go.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Someone is still on this floor! Are you sure you want to move on?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Okay, we'll keep going.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Wait. There could be more powerful enemies waiting ahead.   
Go ahead with the others. And be sure to keep at least one other person with you.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Something feels different about the next floor!   
I sense something more powerful... Like a tangible force of will. Stay alert.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - I sense something really strong directly below you!   
Very angry* - You could be in for a fight as soon as you head down. Are you ready?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - I'm picking up a strong reading directly below!   
Very angry* - Are you ready?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - It looks like the enemy is holed up below.   
Very angry* - Are you ready?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - The final dead end should be below you.

The story will develop significantly beyond this point. It is recommended to save your game first at the Desert of Doors.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - Are you ready?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - Hold on!   
There's something about the door on that floor...   
Aigis, could I ask you to investigate that door?

Aigis - Thoughts   
Should I return to the entrance?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Are you ready to return to the entrance?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Roger that.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Would you like to return to the Desert of Doors?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Okay. I'll be waiting for you.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sorry to cut your exploration short, but please come back for now.

Got it.   
In a bit.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - FUKA_STOP_RETURN_00   
Very angry* - Wait! There must be something on that floor...   
Very angry* - The rest of us were just about to head over there.   
Very angry* - Do you want to return to the Desert of Doors without taking a look around?

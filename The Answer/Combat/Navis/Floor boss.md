Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's enemy territory up ahead. Are you ready for battle?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The enemy is strong. Please make sure you're ready before fighting!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Are you ready?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Are you fully prepared?

Yeah, let's do it! We're unbeatable when we fight together, right, Sister?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - The battle ahead will be unavoidable. Are you sure you want to go on?   
   
Aigis - Thoughts   
I feel as if something has welled up   
inside me more than usual from battle...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - I detect a Shadow ahead! It seems to be a very powerful one!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - It looks like we have no choice but to fight it if we want to keep going...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I don't sense any more enemies around...   
Surprised - Oh! There's a treasure chest further ahead!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I wonder if that Shadow was guarding this...   
I don't think we've run into one like this before. Please inspect it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It looks like we'll have to battle if we want to explore beyond here.

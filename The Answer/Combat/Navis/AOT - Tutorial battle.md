Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - There's a Shadow directly ahead of you! Though it doesn't seem to have noticed you yet.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Aigis, since you're equipped with firearms, I bet you could shoot them from afar.   
If there's enough distance between you and the Shadow, then I don't think they'll notice you. How about giving it a try?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Another Shadow up ahead. Let's get you more accustomed to combat.   
Angry - The battle's about to begin! Everyone, stay focused!   
   
Junpei Iori   
The heck? Hey, I found some kinda boxy-lookin' thing.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yes, boxes like those seem to be scattered all throughout Tartarus.   
Sometimes they contain useful items for battle. Seek them out as often as you can.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oh sweet, so they're basically like treasure chests!   
Happy - Hell yeah! Let's bust it open and see what's inside!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Hey, c'mon! Aren't you dyin' to know what's inside!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Shadow detected.   
Looks like they haven't noticed you yet. Now's your chance.   
Try sneaking up on them from behind! Make sure you stay out of their field of vision.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Hold on, Aigis!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The enemy will notice you if you get too close. Try pulling back and shooting from afar.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I detect another Shadow up ahead.   
Take advantage of what you just learned. Try not to alert the enemy as you move.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The goal today is to gain experience in battle! Running away is not an option.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I hope you're not tired yet because it's time to step it up.   
Now approach the enemy from behind, carefully.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Hey, I found some stairs!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Wait! We're looking for the teleporter, aren't we?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Exactly what Takeba said. Please prioritize getting back safely for now.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Wait, don't waste this chance. Try opening that box.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That reaction... Do you have a **Twilight Fragment** with you?   
Try holding it up to the treasure chest.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looks like you found a teleporter.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Now use it to return to the entrance.

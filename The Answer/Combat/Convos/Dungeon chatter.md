Junpei Iori   
Gotta say, I wasn't expectin' to go on another adventure with Sanada-san.   
I bet I'll come outta this in even better shape than last year! Right, Amada?   
   
Ken Amada   
Yeah, same here. I'd say he's been a good influence on us.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Oh really? Well, I'd say you've both been slacking off.   
   
Junpei Iori   
What!? C'mon, man, I've been gettin' some exercise in!   
   
Ken Amada   
And that's between all our schoolwork! We don't have that much time to train...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Do you hear how you both sound, making all these excuses?   
Deep down inside, you know how disappointed you are in yourselves.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Uh, wow, that's a bit harsh. I'm not that disappointing...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Staying true to yourself no matter who you have to fight... That takes guts.   
I gotta say, Junpei... I'm impressed.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh...? Wait, what? Oh, uh... Nah, I was just doin' what anyone'd do, right?   
   
Ken Amada   
You don't have to be so embarrassed, Junpei-san. You're even blushing.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Wh— I ain't blushin'!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You too, Amada. It felt good knowing I had a reliable partner watching my back.   
   
Ken Amada   
R-Really? But I didn't, uh... I was just...   
   
Junpei Iori   
You don't have to be so embarrassed, Amada. You're even blushing.   
   
Ken Amada   
Seriously? That's extremely childish, you know.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Uh, how did this turn into an argument?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I realize this may be a bit of an awkward time and place to say this, but...   
I'm glad you're here, Yukari. It's been too long since we've last seen each other.   
   
Koromaru   
Ruff!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You're right, Koro-chan. I guess I haven't seen Yukari-chan in a while either.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, um... I wasn't trying to avoid you guys or anything...   
I just, uh... Sorry.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
There's no need to apologize. What's important is that we're together now.   
So, let's resolve this predicament we find ourselves in, shall we?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Heh... Right.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, uh... I... I'm really sorry.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hm? What for?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
For... basically making you take my side.   
I was just being selfish, and... took my own feelings out on everyone else...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hm... I'm afraid I haven't the faintest idea what you mean. Do you, Koromaru?   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Come on, Koromaru. Don't answer like you know what's going on.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
But he does know. Don't you, Koro-chan?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yes, I'm certain that he does, Yukari.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Why're you all ganging up on me?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Heh, been a while since the team looked like this, huh?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I suppose... From your perspective, this was the original lineup. But with Aigis.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeah, we got the OG squad here!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
There's no point getting all sentimental. Let's just focus on the mission.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Damn, Yuka-tan. What's got you all grumpy?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I'm not grumpy.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
It just feels right, the team lookin' like this, y'know?   
All us old-time Tartarusers, hittin' the road together... Right, Yuka-tan?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Why would I "feel right" with you around? You're always so loud.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You say that, but I can tell from how you fight that you're more relaxed as well.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Wh— Mitsuru-senpai! Don't give Junpei the satisfaction or it'll go to his head!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Haha...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf, arf!   
   
Ken Amada   
Koromaru, wait! Don't just go running ahead of everyone else!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Fearless as always... He doesn't seem worried at all about our situation.   
   
Ken Amada   
Well, I get that he's excited. It has been a while since we teamed up like this.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf, arf!   
   
Ken Amada   
Hey! I told you to stop running ahead!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant*   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Huh... I'm just thinking, we won't have many more chances to go on walks anymore.   
   
Ken Amada   
Oh, um... It'll be okay. I'll take Koromaru out on jogs after you leave, Sanada-san.   
We're gonna keep training together, so don't worry about us!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Heh... Glad to hear it.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's been some time since we've actually seen each other in person, huh?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's a little late to be bringing that up now, isn't it?   
Besides, I'd say that's largely due to you not reciprocating my requests to talk.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I've got my own business to take care of too, you know.   
And I won't offer anyone special treatment—not even a Kirijo.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Well... No one can say you don't stay true to your convictions.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Haha...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
What're you laughing at? You're creeping me out.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sorry... I was just thinking back on your choice. It couldn't have been more you.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Of course it was me, I'm the one who made it. Your choice, meanwhile...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What about my choice?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I was about to say your choice wasn't like you at all, but actually... It was.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yes, I think so as well.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We'd probably be able to get further more easily with a bigger group, but...   
At least the two of us will get stronger like this, so I guess it's fine.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Man, it's kinda scary goin' in with just two people. That's a lotta responsibility!   
But don't worry, Ai-chan, I'm here for ya! Just follow my lead!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Though there may be only two of us, I feel assured with you at my side, Aigis.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Just the two of us, huh? Sounds like a challenge... Heh, fine by me.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
It feels more dangerous with such a small group, but I can handle it.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan seems like he wants to give even more since it's just you and him.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
It's just you and me, Sister! I'll do everything I can to keep you safe!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, Aigis... I just... wanted to say, uh...   
Um...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
What is it, Yukari-chan?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Um... Don't worry about it. C'mon, let's do this!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
We testin' our strength? Well, bring it on! I'll knock 'em all outta the park!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I see you've opted for a lineup consisting of just the two of us.   
In that case, I'll do everything I can to ensure that I'm doing my part.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Pretty gutsy, going with a team this small. But don't worry, I won't disappoint.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
Since you're only bringing me along, you must really trust my abilities, right?   
Well, I'll make sure you don't regret it. Let's do it, Aigis-san!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It's easy to tell when Koro-chan is happy. He must like being paired with you.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
I get to be with my sister! Hehe...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey. I know we're not exactly best friends, but do you really have to glare?   
Like it or not, we gotta work together to get out of this. You, me, Aigis—everyone.   
   
Metis   
I'm not glaring...   
......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
What?   
   
Metis   
You're right. I was glaring.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Uh... Okay, thanks for being honest, I guess.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, I got one! Hey, Metis, stop me if you've heard this one...   
   
Metis   
Even if I hadn't, I wouldn't care to.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Aw, come on! You're no fun...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hm... A successor unit to Aigis...   
   
Metis   
Why are you staring at me?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Oh, my apologies. I didn't mean to be so rude.   
   
Metis   
Uh, you don't really need to apologize...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hm... You seem capable. But I guess that's to be expected from Aigis's sister.   
   
Metis   
Of course! Never underestimate us sisters!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
You appear to be much shorter in stature compared to the others.   
   
Ken Amada   
Well, that's just because they're older than me. I'm not short for my age.   
   
Metis   
Your age...   
I comprehend.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Metis   
You don't have to show me how it's done. I already know how to fight.   
   
Koromaru   
Grrr... Woof!   
   
Metis   
What!? Well, yes, but still!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Huh. I wonder what they're arguing about...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
So, Metis, uh... What kinda things do you like?   
   
Metis   
I like my sister, obviously.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Um... Maybe I could've phrased that better.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
I want you to take back what you said.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh? What'd I say?   
   
Metis   
You said I'm "just a kid." I want you to take it back.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Wow, you, uh... You're really not lettin' that go, huh?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
I've been wondering... Why did you decide my sister should be the leader?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hm? Well, her abilities, for one. But mostly because of her intelligence.   
A leader must have observational and decision-making qualities such as hers.   
   
Metis   
Huh... Yeah...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I guess it makes sense for a little sister to cling so tightly to her older sibling...   
   
Metis   
What do you mean?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's nothing. Just thinking out loud...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
We've been teamed up for a while now, but we don't really know each other.   
Once we get out of here and time goes back to normal, let's sit down and talk.   
   
Metis   
"Once we get out of here"...? Ha... Yes, I'm sure you'll find your way out.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Metis   
Yeah, I know.   
   
Koromaru   
Woof!   
   
Metis   
Hehe, of course you would say that.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It looks like Metis and Koro-chan are getting along.   
How nice...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
I know this whole matter is... complicated. But I'm still with you.   
I'll do whatever I can for you.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Even if we get the key, if those fires go out...   
It's scary to think about...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Sister, I...   
Uh, never mind. Sorry...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
This whole time, I just felt so alone... Even though I had everyone right by me.   
I doubt I'll ever live up to Mitsuru-senpai... She's just incredible. Well, nothing I didn't already know.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
We'll be busy once we're out, but we're still throwin' a welcome party for Metis, right?   
Let's find out what places she'd like to go to and hit up the town!   
But first, we gear up, press on, and make that future a reality!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
So our regrets gathered together to form the very entity that created this place... Interesting.   
Sounds like we'll have to defeat this thing if we want to put those thoughts to rest. You ready, Aigis?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I thought I had grown accustomed to facing the things I'd rather not see...   
But I still have much growing to do. And with everyone's support, I know I will.   
All right, Aigis... Let's continue onward, together!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We were so impatient with it all, even before we got stuck here...   
But now, we've all acknowledged it.   
I'm sure everything will turn out all right.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
I thought I was looking at things calmly and rationally...   
But I wasn't. I was just lying to myself the whole time.   
And now that I see that... I have to confront it.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan, you seem really happy to be back with everyone.   
It feels like we've been apart for a long time, doesn't it?   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hehe... I think we can all agree on that.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
I feel like I finally understand the meaning of the word "friend."   
They spoke about the future as if I would obviously be part of it...   
It feels... nice.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
This place doesn't look like Tartarus at all, but it's just as creepy...   
We better stay on our toes.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We don't know anything about this place, so please be cautious...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
I'm a bit nervous, since we haven't done this in a while... Not scared, just nervous.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Kinda feels like we're back in Tartarus... Which just sucks.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
So... We're stuck.   
We could take on a physical wall, but... What good are fists when we're up against time?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
I'm so, so happy to be here with you, Sister. And I love this armband!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Not too long ago, we were climbing up, but now we're heading down...   
'Least we might work out different muscles this way.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
No big issues so far... But there's still a lot more we don't know than we do.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
I might be a little rusty, but don't worry, I'll still give it everything I've got!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I thought I'd at least perform better than this...   
I guess enough time's passed for us to get bent out of shape...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Nothing seems terribly off... But that in itself is a little eerie...   
Maybe I'm just overthinking it.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Can they really help my sister...?   
I guess it's fine...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We used to have time for other things, but now all we do is explore.   
Isn't it weird for us to go so hard when time's basically stopped?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Did she actually think that we would've let her kill us in the first place? Hah!   
Can you believe her? As if we'd go down that easily!   
   
Ken Amada   
Uh... Is that really the problem here?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
My Persona feels a little different now... Maybe it's just because it's been a while.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It's been some time since we've done this... But I'm getting less nervous about it.   
I can't let myself get too relaxed either, though. I'll stay vigilant.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
I'm actually not really that suspicious of Metis-san.   
I saw her face when we said we might leave her by herself...   
It's hard going through life all alone...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
The path ahead is unpredictable, and I don't want to lose you on our way.   
So we need to stay close to each other, all right, Sister?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I've been thinking about that thing we saw... It's not a Shadow, is it?   
Now that we finally have a lead, let's find out where it takes us.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Is that mysterious figure the one behind all this? Heh, things are getting interesting.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
This whole place is mysterious, but that shadowy figure was especially so...   
I wonder what's really going on here...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
What even was that figure anyway? Hard to believe it has nothing to do with us...   
Let's hurry and catch it. We'll get out of here, for sure.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We need more discipline if an opponent of that caliber is considered a threat.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I didn't know Aigis had a sister unit. It's strange...   
And how did Metis end up here...?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
I wonder where that shadowy figure went... Further in, I guess.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
I have no idea what that dark figure is. Where did it come from...?   
It better not try to harm my sister...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
This place looks completely different... Yet we still haven't found any leads.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
Wow, it suddenly looks so different around here. How much is there to go?   
Tartarus was really long... I wonder if the Abyss of Time will be the same.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh god, don't even say that. I don't want to be here for a year!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Hey, Sister! You're my sister!   
Oh, um... I was just calling you my sister. Because you said I could, right...?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I wonder how everyone else is doing... Junpei won't get sidetracked, will he?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'm sure Koromaru will keep him in line and away from anything strange.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It reminds me of Tartarus here... Though I'd rather not think of that.   
Is this place as big as Tartarus was too...?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
We probably still have a long way to go, so let's make sure to take breaks.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We must be over ten floors in by now. Feels like we're nowhere close to the end, though.   
Is there even an "end" to the Abyss...? Eh, we'll find out if we keep moving along.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sanada-senpai's all over the place, as per usual.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
Think we'll end up fighting that dark figure? Whatever it is, it's pretty creepy.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
My sister: the leader...   
That has a nice ring to it! I'm so proud of my sister!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Metis and Aigis might be sisters, but... They're not much alike, are they?   
   
Metis   
W-We definitely are! Why would you say such a thing!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
N-No need to get huffy! You just give off a different vibe, is all.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If there's anything I know I can do, I'll get it done and then some.   
The worrying can wait till after all's said and done.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
Koromaru's really been giving it his all. I've gotta do the same!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Not much to speak of on our end... I wonder if Mitsuru-senpai found anything.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm sure being the new leader is tough, but I'll do all I can to help you!   
Let me know whenever you need anything, okay?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
It's nice getting to walk with someone like this.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
So this is it, huh. Nowhere else to go, and no telling what'll come out of this...   
Brace yourself, Aigis.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
I feel like the mood is different now from when we were in Tartarus...   
What could be waiting for us in here...?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
What's the deal with this place? Didn't think we'd be sent back to the past...   
Right when I was struggling to muster the courage to look forward, at that.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Yukari-chan...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Haha, don't mind me. I'm just griping. Sorry about that...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Junpei's back—and better than before! This expedition's gonna be nice n' smooth!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hehe, how very reliable.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, I ain't exactly in top form or anything, so uh, yeah, y'know, fine print and all that...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan seems so happy. Maybe he's glad to be with everyone again.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
So not only are we stuck in time, we're also, like, going back...? What's that all about?   
Gotta be something weird behind all this... I mean, what other explanation is there?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
So that was Paulownia Mall last July... Maybe if we kept looking, we'd find—   
   
No, forget it. What's the point?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
It really felt like we were back in the past. I can't say I liked it...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hm, can't put my finger on it, but... Isn't there somethin' weird about li'l sis here?   
Better keep your guard up, Junpei. Stay alert, protect Aigis. Ten-hut!   
   
Metis   
Actually, it'd make me happy if you were so vigilant for my sister's sake.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Uh, I-I wasn't talkin' about you or anything! Like, in a bad way! All good things, I swear!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I honestly hadn't realized it before, but I think I've been pushing myself too hard.   
We'll have an easier time once we're able to resupply.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Seems like everyone's been kinda down lately.   
I thought finding a supply route would be something to be happy about...   
I... don't comprehend...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
That Paulownia Mall was strange, but I'm more worried about that dark figure.   
Something like that in a place where time doesn't flow normally... What's it mean?   
   
Koromaru   
*whine*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, I'm sorry, Koro-chan. I didn't mean to worry you.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
We may not know how this place works, but I'm sure we're making progress.   
We even have a way to restock supplies now! That's a pretty good step forward.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
The more people we have on our team, the more combat options we have.   
I guess that would be helpful to my sister...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
So how do ya like bein' leader, Ai-chan? Probably not a total cakewalk, huh?   
But, hey, I got your back—100%! Now put on your game face and let's get to marchin'!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Heh, well, someone's confident. Since when did you talk big like that to the leader?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Uh, I've always been this confident, though?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Time keeps starting over, but our energy is still always running out...   
The Dark Hour was one thing, but what'll happen if we're here for too long...?   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh!   
You're right, Koro-chan. I shouldn't let myself worry so much.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
My sister's friends are actually pretty capable in battle.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Excuse me? We may be out of practice, but we're more than "pretty" capable.   
   
Metis   
You wish to be excused? I don't understand...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
......   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Now that we found a supply route, that's one less thing to worry about.   
This really is Tartarus all over again, just with no sleep and no breaks.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I feel a little better now that Junpei-kun and Koro-chan are with us again.   
I hope Kirijo-senpai will return soon too...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
Things have gotten a lot livelier since Junpei-san came back.   
Which has its pros and cons.   
   
Junpei Iori   
C'mon, you couldn't just leave it at "livelier"?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
This is just so frustrating. Combat never felt this hard before, but now...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
All of us explorin' together kinda reminds me of befo— Er, forget that I said anything.   
Don't wanna kill the mood or nothin'.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
*whine*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan's staring at Aigis.   
Maybe he's feeling lonely because she can't understand him as well anymore...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
That thing was hangin' around when we were fighting those strong Shadows, right?   
Probably oughta watch our backs when exploring, yeah?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That was the same figure we saw before, wasn't it? What's it up to...?   
I say we corner it and demand answers. It better not think of giving us the slip.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I hope we don't end up running into anything too dangerous...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Finally seems like we're making progress...   
But if this ends up getting us nowhere, I'm gonna lose it.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Another victory SEES'd! Heh, like my new catchphrase? Juuust kidding! Or am I?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I wonder how Mitsuru-senpai's doing... I'm a bit worried about her.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Don't be. I'm sure she's doing just fine.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh man, I thought we were gettin' somewhere, but we're probably just halfway, huh?   
Still got a looong ways to go...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Looks different here. Wonder if the enemies have changed any, too.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
The vibes here are kinda off... Thought so when it was just me and Koromaru, too.   
Throw some Shadows into the mix, and... Euuugh.   
   
Koromaru   
Ruff! Arf, arf, arf!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Haha, thanks for the push, pal. Knew I could always count on ya!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
Suddenly becoming the leader must've been tough, but you're doing a great job.   
I feel very confident every time we go into battle with you in charge.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
What was it behind that door...? A Paulownia mole?   
But it didn't seem to resemble any kind of subterranean mammal at all...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um, Metis, it's not "mole," it's "mall"...   
   
Metis   
It's what!?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Time's not advancing at all, huh... If only it'd stop when I'm studying.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
That'd definitely come in handy for our entrance exams.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
And for licenses and certifications, too! Wait... What am I saying?   
We should focus on getting out of here, but I just totally went off track.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
That makes two of us...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Huh, I'm the oldest one here right now... Well, you can count on me for anything, Aigis.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan's so peppy!   
I bet he feels like he can do anything right now. You can do it, Koro-chan!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
It feels kind of suffocating, going down this much, doesn't it?   
The airflow hasn't changed, though... Maybe it's just all in my head.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf, arf!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
What're you rushing us for? There isn't gonna be food down there or anything.   
Wouldn't mind if there was, though...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, I guess Sanada-senpai's hungry...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
It's been some time since we saw that unknown figure... But nothing's happened.   
At least my sister's safe, but I want her to accomplish her goals too...   
Ugh...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We've gone quite a ways by now... Here's hoping we find some kinda clue soon.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, man, guys, this is bad... What do we do?   
We've gotten pretty far, but if we step out for a breather, we're technically still trapped!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Junpei... Please, just stop.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I need to make some adjustments to my current training regimen...   
Looks like it's just my stamina that didn't take a hit. Gotta keep up the running.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
The vibe here is kinda similar to where we found the door to Paulownia Mall, isn't it?   
Wonder where this one will take us...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Was that figure just trying to get in our way?   
Or... was it guiding us here...?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
The doors reflect the minds of those who enter... Is that actually true?   
Well, I guess anything goes in a place like this.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
We all knew what you went through, Amada, but seein' it play out like that, well...   
It's totally different hearin' it from someone else... Blindsided us all, I think.   
   
Ken Amada   
It's okay, I don't mind. I trust all of you, so...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Wow, um...   
Sorry, I'm... just getting a little choked up.   
   
Ken Amada   
You are? But why?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Apologies for the extended absence. I'll be sure to focus on exploring now.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I keep thinking about what Amada-kun said...   
About "that feeling we all shared"...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
Reliving that memory was tough... But I actually feel better about it this time.   
Sanada-san got mad on my behalf, and everyone else was there for me too.   
I wish I could tell my past self what it'll be like seeing that memory again now.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
I don't understand my sister's friends...   
They say they want to leave this place, but...   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Metis   
Oh, because that makes sense.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Honestly, I'm a bit relieved to have you back with us, Mitsuru-senpai.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm happy to be back. We'll stick together from here on out.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Reliving those feelings, huh... And here I thought I had myself all figured out.   
But I didn't—not until I had to face the truth all over again.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
So... The door has shown us a clue on how to destroy the Abyss of Time.   
But what, exactly? Is it something in our past? Just what is this place...?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Awright, next clue, where you at, hm?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It feels so long since I've navigated for Kirijo-senpai... I'm a little nervous.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Is that so? Regardless, I'm sure you'll be giving us the best support you can.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Everyone talks about the past so much.   
They probably need it to get out of here... And that would help my sister!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, Aigis... You sure Metis is your little sister?   
Honestly, I dunno if I can trust her.   
   
Metis   
I couldn't care less about your trust, but know this...   
We ARE sisters. Make no mistake.   
   
Junpei Iori   
THAT'S your takeaway!?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If he were here... I wonder what he'd say about that door—and what it showed us.   
Though I guess thinking about that is just a waste of time.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Taking on the leader's mantle must be difficult at this time...   
But I believe you're capable of seeing it through, Aigis. Give it the best you've got.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Things like going to school and studying feel natural to me...   
But navigating for everyone also feels natural.   
It's odd, isn't it? Especially since we explore such dangerous places.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
I'm getting thirsty...   
Wait... Are our bodies still metabolizing even with time looping...?   
Eh, probably better not to think about it.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Sister, let me know right away if you need anything. I'm always here for you!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Aigis as the leader, huh...   
......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Yukari-chan...? Are you not feeling well?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Mm... No, I'm fine. It's nothing.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan's always so full of energy after beating a strong enemy.   
Maybe he wants to keep up his momentum?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Our surroundings may look different, but my readings seem the same.   
I have to wonder if we're actually making any progress...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
Maybe I should start running more after we get out of here...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
My sister's protector... You know that's me! Metiiiis! ♪   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hell of a good mood she's in...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Phew. Gonna take me a little breather...   
Well, 'least our feet aren't covered in nasty, squishy gunk. Silver lining and all that, yeah?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If only we could go toe-to-toe with a stronger foe for a change.   
Nothing beats taking on a real challenge to gauge your own strength.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Even after coming this far, I haven't seen Metis behaving suspiciously.   
But there's still much we don't know about her, so let's not lower our guard just yet.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Everything looks the same in here. It's sooo boring.   
For a place so outrageous, you'd think it'd look the part. I oughta spruce it up myself.   
   
Metis   
"Spruce it up"...? How would pine trees make the Abyss more "outrageous"?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh man... My head's spinning, looking at the same old scenery for too long.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
It must be weird having someone you don't know say they're your little sister.   
If I got a big brother out of nowhere, I wouldn't even know how to feel.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Mm, and unexpected siblings could complicate family inheritance matters.   
   
Ken Amada   
Uh, yeah, I... I guess I didn't think of that...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Being a leader, huh...   
If someone told me to take command, I'd do it, but I doubt I'd be the best fit for the job.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sanada-san as the leader...   
Yeeeahhh, not too sure about that.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
An abyss of time, indeed... All that we've seen are perfect reconstructions of our memories.   
Aigis, let's hurry and progress the expedition. We need to get to the bottom of this, quickly.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I wonder what Koro-chan thinks about not being able to leave this place.   
   
Metis   
He doesn't seem particularly bothered by it. He's got enough food, after all.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Well, he certainly knows his priorities.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We better keep moving. Seems like we still have a long road ahead of us.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
I'm worried we'll lose track of what floor we're on. I thought this last year too...   
Right now, we're on the... 12th floor. Not the 13th. I'm pretty sure.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
You know what, Sister's friends? You're doing all right.   
But I'm the one who protects my sister. And don't forget it!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
That was the same figure, right? The one we saw before?   
It'd be nice if it just told us what it wants, but nooo, it's too shyyy...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That strange figure is worrying...   
It may be connected to whatever trapped us here.   
Let's keep our guard up as we proceed, Aigis.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
Just what is it...?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Is that unidentified figure trying to stop us from progressing...?   
Unacceptable. How dare you try to get in my sister's way!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
That's the second time we've beaten that one. I hope there won't be a third...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I'm not exactly patient, but I know you gotta take some things one step at a time.   
   
Ken Amada   
That's very mature of you, Yukari-san. There's a lot I can learn from you...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Uuugh, seriously, how much further do we have to gooo!?   
   
Ken Amada   
Didn't take very long for her to crack...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hm, might look different down here, but I'm guessin' we still have a lotta ground to cover.   
Time to buckle up. We've got a long road ahead of us...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I guess all we can do is keep exploring little by little, just like last year.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's frustrating we're trapped in here, but at least there aren't any distractions.   
Nobody nagging at you, telling you what to do... Honestly, it's not that bad here.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The time loop... The Shadows...   
I can't help but be reminded of Tartarus and the Dark Hour... Much as I'd rather not.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
*sniff* *sniff*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan? Um, I don't think there's anything there...   
   
Koromaru   
*whine*   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
We got so far, but nothing's really changed. Wish something excitin' would happen...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I don't know, Junpei-kun...   
   
Junpei Iori   
I meant, good exciting! Not "dangerous" exciting!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There are actually some things about time not moving that I find reassuring.   
Like our families won't be worried about us, since it's all just one day to them.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
A hole this deep sitting just under the dorm... It defies physics.   
Tartarus did too. So many impossible things keep happening...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Here's an idea: why not knock out our homework while we're stuck here?   
Ha, but just 'cause I'm full of good ideas don't mean I always make good decisions!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I think I warmed up plenty. I don't know about you, but I'm ready for a real fight.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Working with others is difficult. I never thought about that before...   
But I've been doing all right so far... Right? Yes! I've been doing great!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Tartarus had us going up, but now that we're going down...   
Couldn't we just dig a hole in the ground and make ourselves a shortcut?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Akihiko, some plans ought to stay on paper.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's plausible she may be a prototype for the next-gen Anti-Shadow Suppression Weapon, but...   
I suppose it doesn't matter what she is. Better to focus on finding a way out.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
My sister's companions are wearing uniforms... School uniforms...   
I wonder if I would look good in one...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sometimes, things start to become clearer with experience.   
I wonder what this next door will show us... Let's move, Aigis.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* *pant*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan's got a glimmer in his eye. Maybe he senses something...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Seeing my middle school self was certainly a strange experience...   
I tried so hard to look in control. Normally, I wouldn't say this about myself, but... It was rather cute.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
It was interesting seeing what Sanada-san was like in middle school...   
Maybe... I'll be that tall in a few years too...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Don't worry, kiddo. I'm sure ya got plenty of puberty ahead of ya.   
   
Ken Amada   
Pu— What!? Why would you put it like that!? Ugh, just forget I said anything...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
Ruff! Ruff, ruff!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
What is it? You've been barking an awful lot lately.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
And he won't take his eyes off you, Sanada-senpai...   
Maybe he was inspired by what we saw in your past!   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Heh, whatever you say, buddy. If you're fired up, then so am I!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
There's no avoiding the past here... But I guess that's what this place is all about.   
Let's just assume these memories are clues and move on. What else can we do?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
As Yamagishi and the others have been saying, I doubt Metis has bad intentions.   
But that doesn't necessarily mean she's not our enemy. I'll be keeping my guard up.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
After we escape the Abyss of Time, it'd be nice to take Metis around the school.   
Hehe... That thought reminds me of when Aigis started attending.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Great idea, Koro-chan! We can go on your usual walk route to get there.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
I've been watching Metis since we all talked, and, well... She really is just a kid, y'know?   
Kinda reminds me of... Well, me? Past me, I mean.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Huh... Yeah, I kinda see it.   
   
Junpei Iori   
You do!? Hrngh, that's sweet you agree, but man... It's a huge blow to my pride.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If we were to return to the dorm or Paulownia Mall, we'd find them unchanged.   
This is a different sort of confinement from the Dark Hour...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
The school was fascinating, but so is seeing how the human body changes.   
You can tell it's the same individual even though they look different...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Huh... I don't think any of us would have thought that you have such interests.   
   
Metis   
Well, it's actually not so different from us!   
I think I would recognize my sister no matter what parts she had!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I see... I'm sure you would.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I'm starting to feel it in my legs...   
Going up was exhausting, but going down... isn't much better, either.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Still can't net that decisive win... Maybe I should change up my footwork next time?   
   
Junpei Iori   
His head's always in the ring, isn't it...?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
What Junpei-kun said is pretty interesting, about how she's like a kid.   
   
Metis   
I don't like that. I'm not a kid.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, okay, sorry. Hehe...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
Metis-san is "like a kid," huh...? She sure doesn't look like one.   
So... Do I address her like someone my age or like someone older than me...?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You've covered a lot of ground. Are you sure none of you are tired?   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hehe... Koro-chan, as ready as ever!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Sister... Is it just me, or are your friends acting differently towards me now?   
I don't think it was like this before...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
"This random rich girl lost it," bahaha! That's a good one! Gets me every time!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
At least have the decency not to laugh in my presence, Iori.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hmm, what if we didn't teleport and just ran from the top down instead?   
Surely that'd be easier than going bottom up like we would in Tartarus.   
   
Ken Amada   
W-Would it really...?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Not to downplay our situation, but to be honest, I'm a bit thankful time's stopped.   
...Since it means I won't be inconveniencing anyone with my prolonged absence.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I feel like we've been exploring with Metis for a while now.   
But it's hard to tell with time acting so strangely...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
It doesn't really look like Tartarus here, but it gives me the same uneasy feeling...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf, arf!   
   
Metis   
Yeah, I know. You don't have to bark at me like that.   
   
Koromaru   
Woof!   
   
Metis   
Tch, you just have all the answers, don't you?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Maybe Metis keeps calling for her sister all the time 'cause she's like a baby chick.   
With how they imprint on the first thing they see. I could be wrong, though.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Man, it's just explore, explore, explore, aaall freakin' day. Talk about boooring!   
Eh, not like I was doin' much. Just feel like I oughta be out there, doin' something, y'know?   
   
Ken Amada   
Yeah, I think I do know what you mean.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I started a training regimen last year since improving my stamina was a necessity.   
I didn't expect to fall back on it so soon, but it's the reason I'm still able to keep walking.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
I bet there's still a lot left to go in this place, so let's try to pace ourselves.   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant*   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Ha... Koromaru appears quite spirited, as per usual.   
No matter what happens, you always manage to stay levelheaded. Good boy.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
I could follow my sister forever!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Well, you've got quite a fan here, Aigis.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I think I've regained my battle prowess, but I admit I'm still far from my best...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
That midboss ain't so tough now! C'mon, let's keep this train movin'.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Our surroundings changed... But that's like the only thing that seems different.   
Guess that means we gotta keep moving, huh?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
When our surroundings change, the Shadows might change too.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
I don't know how large this place really is either...   
But it doesn't go on forever.   
I think.   
   
Junpei Iori   
You "think"...?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
So you're tellin' me we've been walking for ages, but time's just standin' still?   
Now that don't add up, nope. What happened to all that time I spent walking?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We're wiping our enemies out left and right, but still can't unravel this mystery...   
Just means we need to be careful not to run out of steam.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The fight against the Shadows just doesn't end. Where are they even coming from?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Using Personas is all well and good, but I'm one for hand-to-hand combat.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
I hope I'm not holding anyone back...   
It's hard to tell. Everything's so different from before...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Destroy my sister's enemies, show them no meeercy! ♪   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Uh, I guess Metis is... in a good mood...?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Wish we could just plow through the enemy and go on our merry way in peace.   
But nooope, 'course things can't be that easy.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Metis knows a great deal about the Abyss, but not much about anything else.   
I wonder why that is...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You've traveled so far down... Please keep being careful.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Ugh, I'm not even as good in archery anymore? This is the absolute worst.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
It feels like it's been so long since I've spent this much time with you all!   
I wish I was older so we could at least take classes closer to each other...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Sister, do you want to go scout up ahead? I'll come with you!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Been a while since we last saw that figure... Wonder if it'll be a no-show from now on.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Time may have stopped, but we're only getting stronger and stronger.   
We're in a rough situation right now, sure, but it might actually be ideal for training.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I know we need to keep going in search of answers, but it's equally important we pace ourselves.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It's as if there's an infinite number of Shadows here, like with Tartarus...   
I wonder how they all got here...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* *pant*   
   
Ken Amada   
You've got impressive stamina, Koromaru. Especially for being so small.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
We haven't seen that figure in a while... And we're pretty far down now...   
Maybe it's gonna come back for us at the end like, "Bam!" Be careful, Sister!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I thought I got used to seeing the same scenery, but my morale's still taking a hit...   
Feels like we're hardly making any progress...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
For a place overrun with Shadows, it sure is awfully quiet here.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You'd think we'd be used to exploring on foot after last year, but it's really no easier.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Fuuka said that figure we saw wasn't a Shadow... So what is it, then?   
If they're the one who trapped us here, we'll make 'em answer for it.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
That strange figure again... Let's get it!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Whatever that weird figure is, it got my sister's attention...   
It's not fair.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Now that we've overcome the hurdle, the path forward is clear. Allons-y, Aigis.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
Taking down tough enemies really helps build confidence, huh?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We've beaten some really tough Shadows, but it just never ends...   
Seriously, how far do we have to go?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Wish that, after taking out a strong foe, there'd be another one lined up for us...   
Guess I'll just keep holding out hope.   
   
Junpei Iori   
You actually WANT that?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
It looks different here... Let's keep our guards up, Sister.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
In one fell swoop, Junpei-kun emerges victorious—and the crowd goes wild...!   
Hrm... They say you can visualize things into reality, but I dunno...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That's because you're just daydreaming.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
This part of the Abyss is longer than the others. It's similar to Tartarus like that.   
I wish it wasn't, though...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan's tail is really going... Maybe he's happy to be with everyone.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, come on... Still nothing?   
Well, we've gotten this far, so we better see this through!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Though I'm not sure if my combat skills are up to par, I will say that I'm still fit.   
I'll be able to keep going all the way to the very end. You can count on me, Aigis.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
"Just a kid"...?   
Hmph, not that it's bothering me at all. Why would it, right?   
   
Junpei Iori   
That's, uh... still buggin' you, huh...?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Well, one good thing about this place is that the floors are nice and level.   
If we had to move up and down an incline all the time, I think I'd be a goner...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
If you add 'em all up, we've done explored a hell of a lot of floors, huh?   
There was too many in the first area... Even more in the next, and then...   
Yep, just one hell of a lot of floors! Moving on!   
   
Ken Amada   
It's good you know when to give up...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf!   
   
Metis   
Really...? You sure know a lot, Koromaru-san.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Metis can't be so bad if Koro-chan gets along with her like this.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Are we gonna see someone's past again? It might be a clue, sure, but... Eugh.   
Please don't let it be me... Please, oh please...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Looks like we made it to the bottom. What's waiting for us this time...?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Iori understood that he wanted a friend who would see him for who he really is.   
It's quite impressive, given how long it took me to realize that about myself.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
Junpei-san gets carried away easily, and he can be frivolous and absentminded...   
But he can be impressive when he puts his mind to something.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hehe... I've noticed that too.   
   
Ken Amada   
Yeah, I think we all know it, even if we don't always see it.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Ah, the dog of destiny—my fated friend! What's up, buddy?   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Alright, alright, I'm comin'! Don't strain your voice barkin'.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Gossiping is seen as a girl thing, but I think guys do it better, don't you?   
Going on and on about striking out, nursing broken hearts... What idiots.   
I remember thinking the same thing back then, but now it's clear you're all hopeless.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
So the doors do mean something... Wonder what, though.   
We saw when Mitsuru and I met, when Junpei and Koromaru met... Is that it? First encounters?   
Wait, no, Amada's was different. Guess that's back to the drawing board.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Akihiko, you'll tire yourself out thinking so hard. Why don't you take a break?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
True, I'm more for raw power over brain power. In which case, let's move out!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
So Junpei-kun and Koro-chan knew each other even before they awakened...   
I think I'm a little jealous. I wish I knew someone in the group beforehand too.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
These Shadows appear stronger than the earlier ones. Let's exercise caution.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
Growing up is tough. There's way more to it than just getting older.   
Those guys in Junpei-san's memory got me thinking about that again...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Every time we go through one of those doors, they always...   
Whatever. I don't want to think about them. I want to think about my sister.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I thought we were finally getting somewhere, but I still don't understand anything.   
Are those doors actually clues?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Honestly, I thought I was gonna die of embarrassment seein' past me.   
But now... Hm, how do I put it... Well, I was just doing the best I could back then.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Junpei-kun...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Haha, man, the hell am I sayin'! Guess I'm more embarrassin' now than ever.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Metis sees something that even the owners of these memories don't...   
Just what is the commonality that they all share...?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
You don't normally get to see memories of others from before you met them.   
In that way... Maybe being here isn't all bad.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I guess if I'd found Junpei a little earlier, I could've met up with Koromaru, too.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah... We were this close, huh?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Junpei-san seems reinvigorated somehow...   
Even though we still don't have any leads... Strange.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We take out the queen, we wipe out the hive... If only bug spray worked on Shadows.   
   
Ken Amada   
Guess we'll need to invest in some Anti-Shadow Spray, then.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
What if we opened that window...? Not that I'd actually do it or anything. Too scary.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That Shadow just then was...   
Actually, never mind. Junpei's face was more horrifying during his first time with the Dark Hour.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Could you PLEASE stop bringing that up!?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The doors disappear once they've served their purpose...   
It may be best to keep that in mind. There's meaning to everything here.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
You all have a lot more stamina than me... I noticed it last year, too.   
I need to try harder so I can keep up.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
*whine*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan, are you hungry? Just hold on for a little longer, okay?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Glad we get to face a tough enemy. Now we're one step closer to our goal.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
I wish I could walk with my sister like this even when we're not exploring...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The scenery is different here...   
The Shadows may have changed as well. Be ready for anything.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
I wonder what else is outside of here...   
If it's an "abyss," there are probably multiple directions you can fall in from.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan's been going around in circles for a while now. I wonder why...   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* *pant*   
   
Metis   
Hm... It seems he would like someone to scratch his rear.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We haven't seen the sky in a while... Which is kind of a strange thought to have.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Even though we're underground, there's light coming through the windows...   
It caught my attention just now. Where the hell is that light coming from?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Aigis, I know it must be tough with your new responsibilities as leader.   
Let me know if you ever need help with anything. I'll do whatever I can.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hehe... I think Koro-chan wants to help out too.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Every now and again, this place reminds me of Tartarus.   
I couldn't explain why specifically. It's just a feeling I have...   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You too? Well, that is certainly validating.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
Maybe extra milk...? No, I need something with more protein...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hm? What was that, Amada?   
   
Ken Amada   
Oh, uh, i-it was nothing!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Sister's enemiiies, go splat and die pleeease! ♪   
   
Junpei Iori   
Uh... I'm not the only one creeped out by that, right?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I think I'm getting stronger... Maybe not as strong as I used to be, but it's something!   
We just have to keep pressing forward and put an end to this...!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
And here I thought we were finally done with stairs...   
Man, at this rate, I'm gonna lose so much weight and wind up the sexiest man alive!   
   
Ken Amada   
If you keep wasting your breath, you'll just tire yourself out faster, you know.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
They don't really calm me down, but taking breaks is still important.   
Even Sanada-san respects the need for a rest between rounds.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That's right. Sounds like you know what you're talking about.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm not sure if she feels the same, but I've grown quite accustomed to Metis.   
She's rather... unique, but we've met many unique people over the past year.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Ken Amada   
Koromaru's got so much energy. I guess going on all those walks has paid off.   
Well, I do a fair bit of walking too, but...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Leave it to me, Sister! I'll beat all those Shadows!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
The floors here are real nice n' clean, huh? Think the Shadows are polishin' 'em?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You know they're not.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Aigis has really grown as a leader. I'm not really sure how I feel about it since, well...   
Never mind, sorry. Didn't mean to make things awkward.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
That strange figure could show up again at any moment...   
In fact, I hope it does. Let's keep going, and maybe it will.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
My legs are gonna be so muscly after all this exercise...   
Even though I've been trying so hard to stay slender.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
It's pretty and all, but I wish we didn't have to be here this long...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
I love walking with my sister. Hehe!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, looks like the kid's havin' a ball.   
   
Metis   
I'm not a kid...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Man, these guys are stubborn as hell!   
They just keep coming one after another. Sure do love us, don't they?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
There it is again! We'll catch it this time, mark my words.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It simply shows itself and flees... Surely, it intends to set something else on us.   
Stay vigilant, Aigis.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Let's hurry onward.   
That strange figure may have the lead, but we can catch up to it.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
That figure keeps just sending Shadows after us and then running away...   
I don't comprehend...   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Metis   
Right!? You get me.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
If only the door could pop up after we defeat a tough enemy... Guess that'd be too easy.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Now that we've gotten past THAT hurdle, it'll be smooth sailin' from here on out!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Heh, how reassuring. Sounds like you'd be a good fit for the vanguard, Iori.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Wha— The, uh... The vanguard? Like... the meat shield?   
Please, oh please, let it be smooth sailin' on the front lines...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The scenery has changed again.   
And we just defeated a strong enemy. I wonder if that's somehow related...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hmhm...   
Oh, I apologize. I was simply thinking about how fitting leadership is for you.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
The Shadows keep getting even tougher.   
But it's not like we're outmatched, of course. Right, Aigis-san?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan's always so happy when he's with Aigis. He must like her a lot.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Aw yeah.   
Getting weaker is always a bummer, but I'd say I'm just about back to 100% now!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If only the supply route we found took us to the front of the station...   
Paulownia Mall is fine, though... Yeah, just... Just fine.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
I hope I'll never have to stop walking with you, Sister.   
But it'd be nice if there weren't any Shadows...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
How many floors have we explored by now? I haven't exactly been counting.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I've been keeping track this whole time. Do you want to hear it?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, um, I think I'm good! Knowing the answer for sure would just get me down...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Wonder what's happening out there...   
I just don't want to make other people worry, you know? Worst feeling ever.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Don't worry, Sister. I'm right behind you.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Keep the battles coming, I'm game. Just make sure we don't burn ourselves out.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It seems fair to assume that we'll see someone's past behind the next door as well.   
So far, these memories are nothing to be ashamed of, but let's brace ourselves.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
It's kind of nice getting to move around this much again.   
I've basically been doing nothing but studying lately. It made me feel so stiff.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Seems like we're making a lot of progress... "Seems" being the keyword.   
It sucks we can't see the finish line. I mean, sure, Tartarus was the same, but still.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Breaks are important, y'know? With all this explorin', maybe we're due for one.   
Liiike, right about... Now!   
   
Metis   
You seem to have plenty of energy to spare, though.   
   
Junpei Iori   
G-Guh...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
A little bit ago, I heard Sanada-san muttering something to himself.   
I thought I heard him say something like, "Ooh me, ooh she"...   
"Me" would be Sanada-san in this context, but who's "she"?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Oh, you heard that, huh...?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We've gotten pretty far. Be nice if one of those doors showed up sometime soon, though.   
Doesn't seem like there's one on this floor, so I guess we gotta keep exploring.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
What exactly are those things we find items in?   
I gotta say, it's not my favorite way to get stuff...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
*sniff* *sniff*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It seems like something's bothering Koro-chan. Is he looking for the door?   
It doesn't look like it's on this floor, though...   
   
Koromaru   
*whine*   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Well, this'll be the fourth memory now. Wish they'd start making sense sometime soon...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Maaan, these doors never fail to blow me away. C'mon, open sesame!   
   
Ken Amada   
You sure seem eager. What's gotten into you?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Ha, I already had a turn! Who's next?   
   
Ken Amada   
Junpei-san...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
The way Mitsuru-san's father spoke reminded me of my mom.   
He sounded angry, but... also sad. Nothing like my mom. So why...?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
*whine*   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I don't have anything in my hand, so there's no need to nudge it, Koromaru.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um, I think he's saying that you can pet him if you want.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Oh, are you trying to comfort me? Haha... I'm sorry if I worried you.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
I'll do whatever I can to help my sister... so I don't get left behind.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I feel awful for Mitsuru-senpai... I wish she could've told us.   
Everything happens so fast, you only realize later you can always confide in a friend...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You're right...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Aw, Fuuka, don't you start getting sad on me, too. It'll be okay!   
Let's just focus on exploring, okay? There's no reason to dwell on these things anyway.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Our priority is figuring out what this place is, but I really want to know what's up with that figure.   
Something about it makes me uneasy, and I don't know why...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Are you tired, Sister? Please let me know if you are.   
I can't heal you, but... I'll carry you on my back!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Reliving that memory has reinforced my desire to protect others with my powers.   
That conviction remains. All that has changed is I now have more to protect.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
So Mitsuru-san was twelve years old in that memory...   
......   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Heheheh... I just realized something that no one else has.   
Ladies and gentlemen! We have now reached our 100th floor!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Er, Junpei-kun? I hate to break it to you, but...   
We're actually on our 103rd floor.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Our what?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
We were all kids once, huh. Even scary people like Kirijo-senpai.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Iori.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Wh-What? I didn't say anything!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Metis said that all the things we've seen have something in common... Maybe—   
   
Er, never mind. I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's hurry and check out the next door.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Mitsuru must have taken that pretty hard... But you can barely tell. She looks fine.   
It can't be easy, dealing with all that. She's more impressive than I thought.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
Running efficiency is determined by how your feet land and your posture...   
I've known that since last year, but I always forget once the fighting starts...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It's important to stay hydrated when you're using so much energy.   
Especially for you, Koro-chan. Let Aigis know whenever you need water, okay?   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
From what we've seen, I predict the next door will be much further ahead.   
But I'll get you there, Sister! Just make sure you're prepared for battle.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I need to pull myself together, but I just can't.   
I know my nerves aren't making things any easier, either...   
   
Koromaru   
Woof.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...He just told me to chill out, didn't he?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Weee've been walkin' in this daaamn maze, aaall the livelong daaay! ♪   
   
Wasn't very uplifting, huh...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Well, if nothing else, it's nice you're cheery enough to sing.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We've all become adept at exploring, but we still must rest when necessary.   
I'd consider returning while we still have some leeway.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Exploring's not so bad, is it? We can fight all we like on our way down.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
I'm starting to remember that using a spear takes more than just arm strength.   
But just knowing something doesn't necessarily make it easy to act on...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan's tail is as straight as an arrow.   
Maybe that means something, like... He's confident in his own strength!   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's unnerving, being trapped here, but if we view this as a chance to focus on training, it'll all be worthwhile.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Uh, 'scuse me, sorry, just one thing—we're not training here, we're exploring...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan's in high spirits. Maybe he's adrenalized after the last battle.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Our surroundings may have changed, but I can feel the truth deep in my bones...   
The road forward will be quite long!   
   
Ken Amada   
Yes, it probably will be very long indeed, Junpei-san...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Quite!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It is truly a precious opportunity, being able to spend time with you all like this.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan doesn't seem to like it when the scenery is suddenly different.   
   
Koromaru   
Woof...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Stay sharp out there, guys! One mistake can cost you everything!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very convincing coming from you, Junpei.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Whoa! When I said "stay sharp," I didn't mean with your words! They cut, y'know?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If it's one thing I learned after getting this far...   
...It's that I'm not where I used to be back in my heyday. I need to train even harder.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
Phew, my legs are starting to get tired. How pathetic...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
I got used to it in Tartarus, but the floor layouts always changing is unsettling.   
I didn't mind it much before, but it's not something I really want to get used to...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Agreed. Desensitization to something so abnormal would be quite disconcerting.   
   
Ken Amada   
Yeah... I-It would...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
Arf?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hehe... Koro-chan keeps looking back to check on everyone. What a kind soul.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Humans are supposed to become fatigued from prolonged exercise...   
So the humans with us must be physically exceptional.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Heh... Our training's not just for show, you know.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
You know, exploring with everyone again got me thinking...   
Mostly about how dumb I was last year... And how much more I could've done.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
To think... We're all being held prisoner by time. Strange, huh? It's not even tangible.   
It'd be nice if we could simplify things, like move time by breaking walls or something.   
   
Metis   
Where is the logic in that?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm having trouble with some of those notes.   
They're quite detailed, but not very orderly...   
I think I'm going to need more time to figure them out. Please sit tight, Aigis.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
There are no limits to how much we can improve ourselves.   
Any level of skill lost can eventually be regained.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That's right—training never ends. Glad to see you get it now.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
You can trust me to watch our backs. I've gotten pretty good at it.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Sister, you look so dignified walking out in front, leading us!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Before all this, I'd never have imagined repeating the same day over and over.   
...What does this mean for my training schedule, then?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh yeah, that thing. That thing that's totally booked for the next six months?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The sheer number of Shadows here seemed odd to me...   
Though it appears more logical if this place truly is related to Tartarus.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Yes, I agree. I'll try to find anything that can confirm that connection for sure.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
The most important thing to me is my sister. And that's not going to change.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I'm feeling better now after all this moving around... Well, a little bit better.   
There's just a lot on my mind... Honestly, I feel as if I'm drowning in my thoughts.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Man, all this walkin' is really puttin' some wear and tear on my poor kicks...   
Thought I wouldn't have to change 'em out for a while after last year.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
It feels like Metis-san is kind of wary of us again.   
It's better than it was at first, but it'd be nice if she started trusting us more.   
   
Metis   
I don't think I'm wary...   
I just don't understand...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That figure showed up to set the stage for our fight on the next floor, didn't it?   
Heh, doesn't matter what Shadows are lying in wait for us. They're all going down.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If Metis is right, that figure may have something to do with our situation...   
Either way, we'll have to catch it to find out. Let's go, Aigis.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
Grrr...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan's been on edge ever since he saw that shadowy figure...   
I wonder what he senses about it...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
I'm worried about that figure and what its ultimate goal might be...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
That unrecognized figure ran away again. It probably wants us to go after it.   
How annoying...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh, the scenery's changed again. Guess that means we still got a ways to go.   
We've seen that so many times now that even I caught on!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The seemingly never-ending floor count does remind me of Tartarus.   
We can only hope that number won't be as high as last time...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan seems enthusiastic, but I hope he's not just forcing it for our sakes...   
This expedition has been going on for some time. I'm worried about him...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Train as though you're in a real battle... Battle as though you're training.   
Gotta be in top form at all times.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
Spears are great in battle, but they can be kinda heavy to carry...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
......   
I'm fine. Nothing's wrong...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
What the doors all had in common... The things Mitsuru-senpai knew...   
I need to think this all over some more...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hm... I can't seem to organize my thoughts.   
Sorting my head is starting to be just as difficult as physical training.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Aigis, remember to give adequate support to each member of the team.   
I'd like to myself, but I'm not sure I'll be able to manage on my own...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
The li'l sis seems kinda huffy, don'tcha think?   
Sure, she's always had an attitude with us, but... I dunno. It's different this time.   
   
Metis   
I am not huffy.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Crap, she heard me.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I wonder why this place exists, and how it came to be...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
It seems like there are as many Shadows here as there were in Tartarus.   
I hope Fuuka-san will figure out why. There's too much we don't know...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I feel like I'm starting to get back into the groove, but really I'm just scraping by.   
Heck, I used to— Ugh, never mind, why bother comparing?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We'd be able to exploit the Shadows' weak points more easily if we knew more about their anatomy.   
It's frustrating how differently they're built from humans.   
   
Ken Amada   
Wow, Sanada-san knows the human body's weak points... Incredible.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Maybe I don't fit in because... I really am just a kid?   
No, that can't be it... Definitely not... Right...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Metis, are you all right? Do you need a break?   
   
Metis   
No, I'm fine! I'm fine...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Whoa! I nearly tripped and tumbled over just now. Watch your step, Ai-chan!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Despite its inconvenience, this situation has provided a valuable experience.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan's right behind you all, just like he was last year.   
I get the sense he won't back down for anything.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Yukari-chan's been really quiet, hasn't she...? I'm a bit worried about her.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I can take out the weaker enemies here no sweat. I'm ready for a challenge.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Perhaps I ought to help Yamagishi analyze those documents, rather than leave it all to her...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, not at all! You're needed on the battlefield. Leave the paperwork to me!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
There's no room for hesitation now.   
Whatever caused this whole thing is waiting for us, so let's go.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Sister, it's the door! Go ahead, open it yourself.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yukari has remained consistent in her ability to fight with undaunted resolve.   
That side of her saved me once, and for that, she will always have my gratitude.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Uh, I can hear you, you know.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yes, I would assume you could. And?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Mitsuru-senpai... You're sure not afraid to be direct, huh?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Metis might be right about the past being all we talk and laugh about...   
I feel like the future hasn't been a very pleasant topic lately...   
Not just since we got trapped in here, but since... that day...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
I'm not sulking or anything...   
I just... don't get to talk to my sister as much as all of you.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
I think Yuka-tan's been feelin' off lately. Kinda like how she was when I first joined.   
We should do something for her, remind her that we're there for her, y'know?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I can hear you.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Whuh!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Honestly... There's no need to go out of your way and do anything weird, all right?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Aigis's sister has a point. These memories are all important—and painful, at that.   
The fact she won't tell us where she came from still rubs me the wrong way, though.   
   
Metis   
I'm not trying to rub you in any which way. I don't even care what you think.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hmph.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
This place was always weird, but now it's getting scary too.   
I wonder what we'll see in the next door. We've got to be ready for anything...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
So... I was the only one who didn't get what the doors all have in common, huh?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Don't sweat it. Wouldn't be the first time.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, what're you tryin' to say!?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
What is it, Koromaru? Did you find some Shadows?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Actually, I think he just wants you to pet him.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, is that what it is? Well... Maybe later. We should stay focused for now.   
   
Koromaru   
*whine*   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
What to say, what to say...?   
......   
   
Ken Amada   
Uh... Approaching others is tough, huh? Maybe just try to relax a little.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Now that we know what the doors have in common... how do we get rid of the Abyss?   
Well, no point wasting time thinking in circles. We just have to keep moving.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Amada basically suggested we reflect on our reasons, but... I'm drawing a blank.   
Feels like I'm off my game. Like I'm doing mittwork and nothing's landing.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, a classic Sanada-san-ism! Totally flies over your head if you're not into boxing!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
*whine*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan seems down... Maybe he has something on his mind.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The past has been far from exclusively blissful, and yet...   
What your sister said is undoubtedly true, Aigis.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There's a lot to think about. I should've already been thinking about it all...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
I'm thinking about what'll come up next and what we might have to do...   
Whatever it is, I'm sure it'll be tough.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Are we making any progress? Everything looks the same as ever, so it's a bit worrying.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Once li’l sis' mask thing comes down, there's just no getting through to her.   
Guess there's not much we can do if she just shuts us out like that.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
The experience gleaned from battling is invaluable. Last year really drove that home for me.   
But it's hard to find a place where combat is a daily occurrence... At least in Japan.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I've been thinking about engaging in more "small talk" lately...   
But I find it exceedingly difficult. Perhaps it's just not one of my strengths.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, uh, it ain't really somethin' you can just decide to be good at.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
This is much simpler than last year. All we have to do is keep exploring.   
But unlike last year, we can't leave whenever we want...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
This is difficult. Though I'm not sure what about it is difficult...   
Maybe that's why it's difficult...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Wasn't Fuuka's reaction kinda weird? What's she tryin' to say about that figure...?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Huh... The way Koro-chan reacted just now... Could it mean...?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Let's go after it quickly. We need it to get out of here.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
That figure, it's...   
Actually, never mind. We'll learn what it is once we catch it.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That was supposed to stop us? Seems they're underestimating us.   
Let's hurry. We'll definitely catch that figure.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Dunno 'bout you guys, but I'm pooped. All the more reason to get pumped!   
Lookin' like crap just makes you feel even worse, y'know?   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeah? You get me, bud? 'Preciate you, I really do, Koromaru!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
Looks like we've made some more progress.   
It's not ideal that our surroundings changing is our only indication of that, though...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
It feels different here... We need to be prepared for anything.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Only easy pickings around here, huh... Perfect. Just what I needed to lift my mood.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
For most of last year, our goal and how to achieve it seemed relatively clear. But now...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I've been making some progress going through those notes.   
I'll be able to share what I find soon. I should probably organize it all first...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
The Shadows ain't gonna go any easier on us just 'cause we're off our game.   
They didn't last year, and they sure won't start now. Wish they'd chill, though.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Our priority right now is to press forward and keep exploring.   
We can't afford to waste any more time getting lost.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan's back in high spirits. Did seeing that figure do something...?   
Hm... I'm probably just overthinking it.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It feels as if doing all we can is never enough. It's frustrating...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
She can't tell us anything about herself because she has no memories...   
I wonder if that's true or if Metis-san just doesn't want us to know.   
   
Metis   
I have nothing to say to that.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan never leaves Aigis's side... Maybe he's protecting her.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hurry, we have to catch up...   
I know saying it out loud won't make a difference, but still, I just have to...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Yukari-chan...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Runnin' around, seein' the same sights over again... Now that's what I call good exercise!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
I just have to protect my sister. That's what I'm here to do...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
What're you sulking about? Something wrong?   
   
Metis   
I'm not sulking.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exploring's dangerous and tiring, yeah, but sittin' on our asses is just not an option.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Everyone seems to be weighed down by something. It's similar to last...   
No, we should focus on our current predicament. In fact, we need to.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
Um... Sister...   
Uh, never mind, it's nothing.   
   
Koromaru   
*whine* Arf!   
   
Metis   
No. Bad. Don't be so nice to me...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Huh... What's that supposed to mean...?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
......   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Last year, we fought so that we could live to see tomorrow...   
Who'd have thought we'd be stuck in time and may never see tomorrow again...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
At least we know a lot more than we did at first, but I'm still feeling uneasy...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
You know, we've been so busy lately that I haven't had much time to stop and think.   
But now that we're stuck exploring, I've been looking back on all kinds of stuff...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Manipulation of time... It reminds me of my grandfather's original goal.   
I can't say I've ever shared his desires.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan keeps checking on you all like he's looking out for you.   
He really seems like a leader...   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's finally showed itself to us. Now we just chase it down—all there is to it.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
If whatever it is we need to see is at the end, we just have to push through to it.   
That's all we have to do. In fact, it's all we can do.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
We have to keep moving. Um, not that I think you don't know that, Sister...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I believe it'd be wise to put stock in Yamagishi's earlier report.   
All that's left is to confirm it with our own eyes. Let's go, Aigis.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
Grrrrr...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan seems restless, even with that strong enemy defeated.   
Maybe he senses what's waiting up ahead...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Huh? Our surroundings changed again. That's a sign of progress... Right?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Alright, back in the game! Let's wrap this up, so we can get the hell outta here!   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
The Shadows here might be different since we're in a new area.   
Let's change up our battle strategy if needed. Gotta stay light on our feet.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
It's weird to think this is technically all one day, even though it feels so long.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan's always so bold and confident... He's amazing.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
I have to be helpful to my sister. That's my only purpose...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
I know it's kinda late to ask, but... What the heck is behind this whole time loop thing?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Even the weaker Shadows can still pack a punch. Best we can do is return the favor.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
As tempting as it may be to proceed hastily, let's remain cautious.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
I feel... strange.   
I want to get to the end, but I also kind of don't...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan's staring at Aigis. What's he trying to say to her...?   
I can't tell, but even so, just the look in his eyes makes me feel relieved.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
I've said it before, but one more time... Actually, I'll probably keep saying it many more times...   
I'm here for you, Sister. And I always will be.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I think... We're nearly there. Just a little longer now.   
Well, I hope so at least. I don't really know if we are or anything.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Kinda hard to breathe down here, huh? I mean, we've gotten pretty far...   
No? Just me?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
No need to push yourself, Aigis. Breaks are also essential to a proper regimen.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Think we'll be able to bust outta here soon? And finally be done with the 31st...   
Wonder if folks'll think it's weird we all got super buff in a day...   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What I must do— No... What I myself want to do hasn't changed.   
Nor will it, no matter what awaits us. Surely, you feel the same, Aigis?   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Ken Amada   
I keep wondering about what could be ahead of us, causing all this.   
Maybe there's no way to know, and it's pointless trying to figure it out.   
But... I want to keep thinking about it anyway.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I seem to be regaining my combat abilities at a reasonable rate.   
Whatever gets in my way, I'm ready to face it.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
There's no telling what we're up against... till we come face-to-face with it.   
Which means we just need to focus on preparing for anything and everything.   
   
===============================================================================================   
   
Metis   
I really respect your determination, Sister. I always have.

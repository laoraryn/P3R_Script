I wonder if Kirijo-senpai and the others are okay...   
   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_DORMITORY_02   
I-It won't come in through the window, right...?   
   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_DORMITORY_03   
Sorry, I know this is sudden and you were sleeping... I promise I'll explain later.   
   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_DORMITORY_04   
Wait, are you trying to escape from the window...? You can't do that!

I wonder how far we can get without losing contact with Kirijo-senpai...

Yo, is this really the school...? Like, no joke?   
   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_TUTORIAL_03   
But it'd be kinda funny if we were actually inside our classroom right now, huh?   
   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_TUTORIAL_04   
Whoa! These open on their own? Sheesh, that scared the crap outta me!

Holy hell, we're real high up! I think I'm gonna hurl...

This place is so creepy...   
   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_MONORAIL_04   
I-It's too quiet here...   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_MONORAIL_05

Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_MONORAIL_06   
Hurry! We don't have much time left!   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_MONORAIL_07   
I-If we don't stop this thing, the passengers— No, all of us are gonna be dead!

Is it that stopped one right there? Looks pretty normal to me so far...

Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_THEURGIA_06

Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_THEURGIA_07   
Time to finish this!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_THEURGIA_08   
You're approaching a Shadow! Get ready for battle!   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_THEURGIA_09   
Let's head to the stairs that lead up, Arisato-kun.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_THEURGIA_10   
Two Shadows left!   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_THEURGIA_11

Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_HOTEL_04   
Let's take it down before it harms any guests.   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_HOTEL_05   
Okay then! Time to head back?   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_HOTEL_06   
Dammit! I gotta do better...   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_HOTEL_07   
This operation felt way too easy...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_HOTEL_08   
I suppose that's the end of this operation...   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_HOTEL_09   
Wait, seriously!? Where!?   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_HOTEL_10   
Huh? What're you talkin' about...?   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_HOTEL_11   
I'll go take a look around.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_HOTEL_12   
So this isn't over yet...   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_HOTEL_13   
...Let's go!   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_HOTEL_14   
There was something weird about that mirror...   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_HOTEL_15   
I dunno what's going on, but we just have to smash the mirrors, right?   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_HOTEL_16   
We just need to break the mirrors, right? Let's hurry and beat this thing.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_HOTEL_17   
So all we need to do is break the mirrors, correct?   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_HOTEL_18   
Something felt off when I stood in front of that mirror...   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_HOTEL_19   
Something off with the mirrors...? Dude, I honestly have no clue.   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_HOTEL_20   
Huh? The mirrors are different? How?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_HOTEL_21   
Perhaps it'll be easier to find the difference by taking a closer look...?   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_HOTEL_22   
We need to break any mirrors that don't show our reflections.   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_HOTEL_23   
Uh, so which mirror do we break?   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_HOTEL_24   
If a mirror doesn't show our reflection, break it.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_HOTEL_25   
Remember: break any mirror that doesn't show our reflection.   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_HOTEL_26   
Okay, let's go!   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_HOTEL_27   
This time, I got this in the bag!   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_HOTEL_28   
Ah, finally! Time for the main event!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_HOTEL_29   
It's time for this operation to come to an end.   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_HOTEL_30

Those two just now— No, worry about that later. The Shadow comes first.   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_MILITARY_02   
Damn, this place reeks. Like sewer cheese...   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_MILITARY_03   
Didn't think there'd be other Persona-users aside from us...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_MILITARY_04   
Those Persona-users just now... Better exercise caution around them.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_MILITARY_05   
Lucia couldn't sense them at all... Sorry, I'll concentrate on the Shadow.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_MILITARY_06   
It seems this facility was in use during wartime.   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_MILITARY_07   
Let's just take down this Shadow and get outta here!   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_MILITARY_08   
Huh? Why the hell are there tread marks?   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_MILITARY_09   
These tracks on the ground seem to be made recently...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_MILITARY_10   
No time to waste. Let's end this before the Dark Hour is over.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_MILITARY_11   
These tread marks... They're new.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_MILITARY_12   
I sense the target two blocks ahead of you!   
It seems to be moving slowly downward.   
Don't let it get away!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_MILITARY_13   
This place...   
It seems it was some kind of armory during the war.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_MILITARY_14   
The target's gaining speed! It's continuing down the tunnel!   
Hurry and chase it down!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_MILITARY_15   
The target's stopped!   
It turned around! It's waiting for us one block down!   
Please be careful!

It seems to be the type of Shadow that steals from the treasure chests. It's quite quick...   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_TBOX_STEAL_MITU__2   
This treasure chest has already been looted. If only we could get ahead of that Shadow...   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_TBOX_STEAL_MITU__3   
It's going after treasure chests. See if you can predict its next move.   
   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_TBOX_STEAL_FUKA_   
That Shadow got the treasure chest! Try to see if you can cut it off before it gets to another one.   
   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_TBOX_STEAL_FUKA__2   
It took the treasure from this chest too! Let's try another one...   
   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_TBOX_STEAL_FUKA__3   
The Shadow is going after all the treasure chests! Let's ambush it at the next one!   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_RBOX_MITU   
It looks like there's a rare treasure chest on this floor. See if you can find it.   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_RBOX_MITU_2   
I sense a rare treasure chest on this floor as well. How fortunate.   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_MBOX_MITU   
There's a locked chest on this floor. If you can, try to retrieve its contents.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_RENEMY_MITU   
I sense a rare Shadow. Try to find and defeat it.   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_ALLBAD_MITU   
Hm... The Shadows on this floor are behaving strangely...   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_ALL_R_MITU   
There are multiple rare Shadows on this floor. This is quite an opportunity.   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_ALL_S_MITU   
This floor is full of strong Shadows... Stay on your guard.   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_DARK_MITU   
I can't tell what's going on there from here, so be more careful than usual.   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_MDOOR_MITU   
I'm sensing a distortion... It must be that door. It's dangerous, but may be worth exploring.   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_RBOX_FUKA   
I'm sensing a valuable treasure chest on this floor. Please try looking for it.   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_RBOX_FUKA_2   
Oh, there's a rare treasure chest on this floor too! That's lucky.   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_MBOX_FUKA   
I'm sensing a locked treasure chest on this floor! We should probably try to find it.   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_RENEMY_FUKA   
I'm sensing a rare Shadow. Do you think you can find it?   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_ALLBAD_FUKA   
The enemies on this floor are acting strangely. Please be careful.   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_ALL_R_FUKA   
There are a bunch of rare Shadows on this floor! Let's not let this chance go to waste!   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_ALL_S_FUKA   
I'm sensing strong enemies throughout this entire floor! Please be extra careful!   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_ACCIDENT_DARK_FUKA   
I can't see what's going on around you right now... Please be careful.

Oh, I'm getting a reading of that door! Please make sure you're ready if you plan to go in.

Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_007_0   
Alright, now we can move on.   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_007_0_2   
There it is! We movin' out?   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_007_0_3   
Hey, it looks like we can head down.   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_007_0   
All right, are we heading down?   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_007_0_2   
Looks like we can go down that way.   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_007_0_3   
This might be a way forward. What's the plan?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_007_0   
There. We can head down that way.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_007_0_2   
It looks like we can proceed from here.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_007_0_3   
Shall we keep going?   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_007_0   
Stairs located. Updating data records.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_007_0_2   
A staircase. Shall we ascend?   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_007_0_3   
Oh, it's the stairs.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_007_0_4   
It looks like this is our way up.   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_007_0   
It looks like we can go down here.   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_007_0_2   
We've found a way down.   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_007_0_3   
That should take us below.   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_007_0   
Woof!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_007_0

Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_007_0_2   
Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_007_0_2   
You can head down from there. Thanks, Koro-chan.   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_007_0_3   
Woof?   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_11_007_0   
Koromaru-san has found a point to descend. He is asking if we'll go down.   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_11_007_0_2   
Here's a way down... Koromaru-san wants to know our next move.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_007_0   
Found some stairs. Time to move on up.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_007_0_2   
So... we headin' up?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_007_0_3   
...That'll take us to the next floor.   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_11_007_0_3   
Oh, we can go down from here.   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_11_007_0_4   
That's our way forward.   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_11_007_0_5   
Sister, I've found it!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DEFEAT_GK_MITU_00   
The enemy has been defeated. Well done.   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DEFEAT_GK_MITU_01   
The path forward is open now. Keep up the good work.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DEFEAT_GK_FUKA_00   
The enemy has been defeated! Great job, everyone!   
   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DEFEAT_GK_FUKA_01   
Now we can keep going. Good luck, and be careful!

Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_001_1   
Alright, squad, move out!   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_001_1_2   
Let's get a move on, party people!   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_001_1_3   
Alright, let's keep moving!   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_001_1_4   
...So? What now?   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_001_1_5   
...Let's go already.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_001_1   
Junpei-kun...?   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_001_1_6   
I'm just as good as him...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_001_1_2   
Junpei-kun, don't act too brashly, okay?   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_001_1   
Okay, let's head out.   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_001_1_2   
Now, what'll we run into next?   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_001_1_3   
Let's keep going.   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_001_1_4   
Best to stay on your toes here.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_001_1   
All right, let's continue exploring.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_001_1_2   
We're doing well. Let's keep up the pace.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_001_1_3   
I trust you're not tired? Then let's be off.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_001_1_4   
There's no room for carelessness. Stay alert.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_001_1   
I am ready to move out at any time. Awaiting orders.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_001_1_2   
All clear to proceed.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_001_1_3   
All systems are go.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_001_1_4   
Resuming the operation.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_001_1_5   
Let's be off then.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_001_1_6   
We're making good progress.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_001_1_7   
Please keep relying on me.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_001_1_8   
Preparations complete, moving out.   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_001_1   
Okay, let's make some progress!   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_001_1_2   
I think we're starting to get somewhere!   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_001_1_3   
Whew... Okay, time to move on!   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_001_1_4   
I'm not calling it quits just yet!   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_001_1   
Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_001_1_3   
You can do it, Koro-chan!   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_001_1_2   
Ruff! Ruff!   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_001_1_9   
Koromaru-san is very motivated. Let us follow his example.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_001_1_10   
Koromaru-san seems very motivated. Let's go.   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_001_1_3   
Arf!   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_001_1_7   
We're countin' on you, Koromaru.   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_001_1   
I'm here for you, Sister.   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_001_1_2   
We better watch our step.   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_001_1_3   
Scanning for hostiles.   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_001_1_4   
I feel a bit uneasy...   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_001_2   
Everyone ready?   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_001_2_2   
All right, let's go.   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_001_2   
C'mon, let's get this show on the road!   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_001_2_2   
Aight, just leave everything to yours truly!   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_001_2_3   
......   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_001_2_4   
...What's with the holdup? Let's go.   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_001_2   
Time to start exploring. Let's move.   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_001_2_2   
All right, let's get started.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_001_2   
Everyone, it's time to get to work.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_001_2_2   
Let's move out. Everyone stay alert.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_001_2   
Commencing exploration.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_001_2_2   
I hope to be of service today.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_001_2_3   
Shall we head out?   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_001_2_4   
I will do what I can to help.   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_001_2   
Let's do the best we can!   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_001_2_2   
I'm all ready to go. Let's get started.   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_001_2   
Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_001_2   
We're counting on you, Koro-chan!   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_001_2   
Okay, let's go.   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_001_2_2   
Let's stick together, Sister.   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_002_1   
Huh, a treasure chest.   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_002_1_2   
Wanna check that chest?   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_002_1   
Ooh, I spy some treasure!   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_002_1_2   
Hey, let's loot that chest.   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_002_1   
It's one of those chests.   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_002_1_2   
There's a chest... Wanna try opening it?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_002_1   
There's a treasure chest. What should we do?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_002_1_2   
Hm? It's a treasure chest.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_002_1   
Treasure chest identified. Will you open it?   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_002_1_2   
Object of value located.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_002_1_3   
I see a chest over there.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_002_1_4   
It's a treasure chest. Let's open it up.   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_002_1   
Oh, a treasure chest!   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_002_1_2   
There's a treasure chest over there!   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_002_1   
*sniff* *sniff* Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_002_1   
Oh, there's a treasure chest!   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_002_1_2   
Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_002_1_2   
I think Koro-chan found something!   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_002_1   
Oh, a treasure chest!   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_002_1_2   
Look, look! A treasure chest!   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_002_2   
Could be something good in there.   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_002_2_2   
Looks like a rare one.   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_002_2   
Yooo, check out that fancy chest!   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_002_2_2   
Dude, ain't that a rare chest?   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_002_2   
...That chest looks like it's worth opening.   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_002_2_2   
Hey, that looks like a rare chest.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_002_2   
That chest... doesn't look like the others.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_002_2_2   
We don't see that kind of chest often. Let's not pass it up.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_002_2   
Rare treasure chest located.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_002_2_2   
Recommended course of action: identifying the contents of that treasure chest.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_002_2_3   
Oh, there's a rare treasure chest.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_002_2_4   
We've found a rare treasure chest.   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_002_2   
Oh! That treasure chest looks pretty rare!   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_002_2_2   
I bet we'll find something good in there. Let's open it up!   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_002_2   
Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_002_2   
That chest looks valuable! Let's open it up!   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_002_2_2   
*sniff* *sniff* Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_002_2_2   
Oh! It's a rare treasure chest! Good boy, Koro-chan.   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_002_2   
There could be something good in there...   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_002_2_2   
Oh, that one looks important!   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_003_1   
We don't need to head back yet, right? Let's keep going.   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_003_1   
One teleporter sighted! It'll take us back to the entrance, but I'm down to keep going.   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_003_1_2   
...That'll take us back to the entrance, but you ain't wussin' out, right?   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_003_1   
That's a one-way teleporter... But there's no need to head back yet.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_003_1   
That teleporter can take us to the entrance. Try to remember where it is.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_003_1   
A one-way teleporter is nearby. Will you return to the entrance?   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_003_1_2   
That's a one-way teleporter. I can keep going, but what should we do?   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_003_1   
That teleporter can take us back to the entrance, but I can keep going!   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_003_1   
Ruff! Ruff!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_003_1   
Koro-chan found a one-way teleporter to the entrance!   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_003_1   
Should we go back, just to be safe?   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_003_2   
I wanna keep going, but... might be better to head back.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_003_2   
Takeba is severely exhausted. Perhaps we ought to head back.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_003_2   
Yukari-chan looks exhausted. Don't overdo it, okay?   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_003_2   
Hey, that's our ticket back. Whaddaya say?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_003_2_2   
Iori is low on stamina. Retreat could be a viable option...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_003_2_2   
Junpei-kun, are you okay? Maybe you should come back.   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_003_2_2   
We ain't headin' back, right? Dude, I'm fine...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_003_2_3   
Junpei-kun, what's gotten into you...?   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_003_2   
...That teleporter will take us to the entrance. What's your call, Aigis?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_003_2_3   
It's important to know when to fall back. I'll trust your judgment regardless.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_003_2_4   
I'm worried about Sanada-senpai... Maybe it's time to come back.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_003_2_4   
This teleporter takes us to the entrance. I'd appreciate a chance to regroup...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_003_2_5   
Kirijo-senpai looks really worn out...! Would you consider heading back?   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_003_2   
One-way teleporter discovered... Shall we use it?   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_003_2_2   
That's a one-way teleporter. What should we do...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_003_2_6   
Leader, I'm worried about Aigis. Maybe we should stop here for tonight?   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_003_2   
Oh, a teleporter! Should we head back?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_003_2_7   
Amada-kun looks tired... It might be a good idea to head back.   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_003_2   
*pant* *pant* *whine*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_003_2_8   
Koro-chan looks really tired... Aigis, do you plan to keep going?   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_003_2   
Um, maybe we should go back soon?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_003_2_9   
I'm getting worried about Metis. It might be good to head back now.   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_005_0   
Another one of those doors...   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_005_0_2   
Haven't we seen that door before?   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_005_0   
It's one of those doors. What do you wanna do?   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_005_0_2   
Oh, another one of those doors?   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_005_0_3   
It's one of those doors... Not that I care.   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_005_0   
...We opening this door?   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_005_0_2   
Another one of those doors? Wonder what's behind it.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_005_0   
Is that... one of those doors?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_005_0_2   
What should we do about the door? It's your call.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_005_0   
Unidentified door spotted... How shall we proceed?   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_005_0_2   
We have discovered a door. Will you enter?   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_005_0_3   
Oh, a door... Should we head in?   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_005_0_4   
It's one of those doors... What should we do?   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_005_0   
...It's one of those doors. What should we do?   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_005_0_2   
Oh, a door... I wonder what's behind it.   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_005_0   
Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_005_0   
Koro-chan found a door!   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_005_0_2   
Grrr...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_005_0_5   
This signal... Is one of those doors nearby?   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_005_0   
Huh... What's that?   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_005_0_2   
It looks like some kind of strange door...

We're making steady progress. Let's keep it up.   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_016_1   
So, we aren't missing anything? Then let's get going.

You sure know how to explore, Sister!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_022_1   
Keep an eye on your health.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_022_1_2

Takeba, are you all right?   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_022_2   
I dunno if I can go on...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_022_2_2   
Takeba's about to collapse. Can she be healed?   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_022_2_2   
...Sorry, could you lend me a hand?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_022_2   
Yukari-chan, are you okay?   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_022_2_3   
I can take this... No problem...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_022_2_2   
Can anyone heal Yukari-chan...!?   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_022_2_4   
Sorry, but... I think I need a break.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_022_3   
Iori's low on health. Are you all right out there?

Whew, things are getting pretty rough.

Sorry, mind helpin' a brother out?

I'm worried about Junpei-kun's health...!   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_022_3_3   
I think I might be in a pinch...   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_022_3_4   
This...? It's just a scratch.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_022_3_2   
Aigis, is there anything you can do to help Junpei-kun?   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_022_3_5   
I could use a pick-me-up if you got one...   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_022_3_6   
This is nothing... I'm fine.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_022_4   
Akihiko's health doesn't look so good...   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_022_4   
Damn, guess I got carried away...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_022_4_2   
Can anyone get Akihiko some healing?   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_022_4_2   
...This is one hard workout.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_022_4   
Sanada-senpai doesn't look so good... Heal him up if you can!   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_022_4_3   
I'm still too weak...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_022_4_2   
Sanada-senpai, please don't act so rashly!   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_022_4_4   
I'm not down for the count yet...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_022_5   
Kirijo-senpai... Are you going to be okay?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_022_5   
Ngh, I shouldn't have pushed myself...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_022_5_2   
Aigis, Kirijo-senpai is in trouble... She needs help!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_022_5_2   
Sorry... I'd appreciate some assistance.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_022_6   
Aigis's health is dangerously low!   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_022_6   
This is just a scratch... as they say.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_022_6_2   
I'm sorry. This shouldn't have happened...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_022_6_2   
Can anyone heal Aigis...!?   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_022_6_3   
...That would be welcome, if possible.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_022_6_4   
I'm sorry for the trouble...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_022_7   
Amada-kun, are you okay? Try not to push yourself too hard!   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_022_7   
Okay, but... I'm fine, really! I can handle this.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_022_7_2   
I'm worried about Amada-kun... Please heal him if you can!   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_022_7_2   
Sorry about this. Please help me out...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_022_8   
Koro-chan looks like he's in bad shape!   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_022_8   
*whine*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_022_8_2   
Koro-chan looks hurt... Someone please take a look at him!   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_022_8_2   
*whine*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_022_9   
Metis has taken major damage... Please help her if you can.   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_022_9   
No, I'm fi— Ngh! Maybe not...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_022_9_2   
Metis can't take much more... You should probably heal her.   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_022_9_2   
Sorry I'm holding you back...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_023_1   
You've lost a lot of stamina... Are you all right?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_023_1_2   
...Don't be so reckless. You won't have enough stamina.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_023_1   
Aigis, your stamina is running low. Do you want to turn in for now?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_023_1_2   
Aigis, your stamina... Please don't overdo it!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_023_2   
Takeba's running low on stamina...   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_023_2   
I think I might've overdone it...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_023_2_2   
Takeba, don't push yourself too hard.   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_023_2_2   
I'm running low on stamina...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_023_2   
Yukari-chan, are you okay...?   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_023_2_3   
I'm fine... Come on, let's go.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_023_2_2   
Yukari-chan looks really worn out. Don't push yourselves too hard!   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_023_2_4   
Yeah, I'm feeling it... Wanna stop for a bit?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_023_3   
Iori... How's your stamina?   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_023_3   
I miiight be havin' a little trouble.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_023_3_2   
Iori looks pretty exhausted. Are you all right?   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_023_3_2   
Whoops. Got a bit carried away there.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_023_3   
Junpei-kun, are you okay...? You don't look well...   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_023_3_3   
Whew... Guess I used my Persona too much.   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_023_3_4   
I-It's whatever...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_023_3_2   
Junpei-kun is almost out of stamina... Don't do anything reckless!   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_023_3_5   
N-Nah, I'm fine! I ain't done yet!   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_023_3_6   
Ha, I could do this all night...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_023_4   
Akihiko looks rather exhausted...   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_023_4   
Ngh, I might've overdone it...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_023_4_2   
Akihiko, you don't have enough stamina. Don't overdo it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_023_4_2   
It's fine... I can still fight.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_023_4   
Sanada-senpai is out of stamina...   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_023_4_3   
Dammit, I think I went overboard...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_023_4_2   
Sanada-senpai is running out of stamina! Be careful!   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_023_4_4   
...Don't worry about me. Let's go.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_023_5   
Kirijo-senpai looks really tired. Is everything okay...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_023_5   
I'm fine... But I could certainly use a break.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_023_5_2   
Kirijo-senpai's low on stamina... She's really exhausted.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_023_5_2   
Ngh, I can't quit here...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_023_6   
Aigis doesn't have much stamina left...!   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_023_6   
...I may have difficulties using my Persona.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_023_6_2   
I can still fight... Just not optimally.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_023_6_2   
Aigis, are you okay? You're out of stamina...   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_023_6_3   
There are... no issues. I can proceed.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_023_6_4   
I'm a bit fatigued... But I can keep going.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_023_7   
Hang in there, Amada-kun. Don't force yourself to keep going!   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_023_7   
I'm okay, but... I do feel a bit worn out.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_023_7_2   
I'm worried... Amada-kun's stamina is really low.   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_023_7_2   
Sorry... I'm actually kind of tired.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_023_8   
Koro-chan, are you doing okay? Your stamina's low...   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_023_8   
*whine*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_023_8_2   
Are you okay, Koro-chan...? Aigis, maybe that's enough for now.   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_023_8_2   
*pant* *pant*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_023_9   
Metis is low on stamina. I hope she'll be okay...   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_023_9   
I am experiencing some fatigue...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_023_9_2   
Metis seems worn out. You might want to consider regrouping, Aigis.   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_023_9_2   
I'm fine! I can keep going! Um... Probably...   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_025_0   
Done. Now let's get going.   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_025_0_2   
Phew, still got it.   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_025_0_3   
Nice work, everyone.   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_025_0   
Awww yeah! Who's up next?   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_025_0_2   
Alright, now, back to business.   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_025_0_3   
Aaand that's a wrap, folks!   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_025_0   
Went off without a hitch. Let's get going.   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_025_0_2   
All right, who's next?   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_025_0_3   
Heh, that was a good workout.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_025_0   
A victory well-earned.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_025_0_2   
All right, let's be on our way.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_025_0_3   
Now then, let's get back to work.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_025_0   
Target eliminated.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_025_0_2   
We have seized victory. Let us proceed.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_025_0_3   
Now then, resuming exploration.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_025_0_4   
Enemies defeated—without incident.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_025_0_5   
Good work, everyone. Now, let's keep going.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_025_0_6   
Ready to get back to exploring?   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_025_0   
We did it!   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_025_0_2   
All right, now back to exploring.   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_025_0_3   
Whew... Guess it's time to move on.   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_025_0   
Woof.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_025_0   
Good job, Koro-chan! Now let's get back to exploring!   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_025_0_2   
......   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_025_0_7   
Koromaru-san seems to be pleased. Well done.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_025_0_8   
Well done, Koromaru-san. Let's keep up the good work.   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_025_0   
Okay, let's be on our way.   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_025_0_2   
That was great, Sister!   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_025_0_3   
No one can stop me and my sister!   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_024_0   
That went well.   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_024_0_2   
All right, let's keep that up.   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_024_0   
...Nailed it! Nice going, Junpei!   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_024_0_2   
Haha, perfecto!   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_024_0_3   
...C'mon, let's go.   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_024_0_4   
...Not like it was hard.   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_024_0   
That certainly went well.   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_024_0_2   
Good teamwork, everyone. Now, on to the next!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_024_0   
Perfect. Just what we hoped for.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_024_0_2   
That was excellent leadership. Keep up the good work.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_024_0   
That was a spectacular finish.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_024_0_2   
We beat them to a pulp, as they say.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_024_0_3   
Victory is ours! Now, let's keep going.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_024_0_4   
Excellent teamwork! As always, of course.   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_024_0   
Nice! That went well!   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_024_0_2   
I'm always happy to team up with everyone!   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_024_0   
Arf! Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_024_0   
Heehee! You looked really cool out there, Koro-chan!   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_024_0_2   
Arf!   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_024_0_5   
Koromaru-san appears satisfied with our performance.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_024_0_6   
...Yes, hopefully our next battle ends just as smoothly.   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_024_0   
I'll always give my all for my sister!   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_10_024_0_2   
I'm doing better than ever!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_030_1   
These readings... Stay alert!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_030_1_2   
Be careful... Something feels wrong.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_030_1   
This reading... It's the Reaper!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_030_1_2   
Aigis, something dangerous is approaching!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_030_2   
...The Reaper's appeared! Get out of there!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_030_2_2   
Look out! Reaper's appeared!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_030_2   
Is this reading... the Reaper!?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_030_2_2   
The Reaper showed up! Be careful, everyone!   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_030_4   
Ugh, we don't have time for this!   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_030_4_2   
Let's get out of here!   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_030_4   
Crap, what do we do?   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_030_4_2   
Oh shit, we better bounce!   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_030_4_3   
Whatever, I can take 'im...!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_030_4   
Junpei-kun, don't be so reckless...!   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_030_4   
Dammit, we can't fight now... It's too risky.   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_030_4_2   
Guess our only choice is to fall back...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_030_4   
Dammit! Run, now!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_030_4_2   
We've stayed here for too long...   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_030_4   
A formidable foe has appeared. How do we proceed?   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_030_4_2   
The enemy is dangerous. I recommend avoiding contact.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_030_4_3   
The enemy is too strong...! Let's escape to a safer location!   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_030_4_4   
It's the Reaper... Let's leave this floor before it comes after us!   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_030_4   
That doesn't sound good... We better get out of here!   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_030_4_2   
We've stayed here for too long...! Let's escape!   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_030_4   
Grrr...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_030_4_2   
Koro-chan has his guard up, too!   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_030_4_2   
Woof!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_030_4_3   
I think Koro-chan can sense danger, too!   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_11_030_4   
It's too dangerous! We have to go!   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_11_030_4_2   
We need to retreat, quickly!   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_030_5   
I'd rather not fight, but we might have to.   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_030_5_2   
It'd be better to just avoid it... What do you think?   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_030_5   
We miiight stand a chance? Just barely, but we'll be fine!   
   
Junpei Iori - AST_DNG_GENERAL_03_030_5_2   
Heh, if we gotta fight, I got your back, bro!   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_030_5   
...This'll be fun. Bring it on.   
   
Akihiko Sanada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_04_030_5_2   
We're in for a fight... But I've got this.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_030_5   
We'll need to prepare ourselves if we engage in combat.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - AST_DNG_GENERAL_05_030_5_2   
I'd rather avoid fighting... But it's your call.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_030_5   
An encounter will lead to a difficult battle. Let us stay on high alert.   
   
Aigis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_07_030_5_2   
Though it may be a difficult battle... I'm prepared to meet it head on.   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_030_5   
...Wh-What's the plan? Do we even stand a chance...?   
   
Ken Amada - AST_DNG_GENERAL_08_030_5_2   
If it's that dangerous, then it'd be better to run for it, right?   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_030_5   
Grrr...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_030_5   
Koro-chan has his guard up, too!   
   
Koromaru - AST_DNG_GENERAL_09_030_5_2   
Woof!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - AST_DNG_GENERAL_06_030_5_2   
I think Koro-chan can sense danger, too!   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_11_030_5   
We should come up with a plan.   
   
Metis - AST_DNG_GENERAL_11_030_5_2   
Hm... We might stand a chance, but...   
   
Yukari Takeba - AST_DNG_GENERAL_02_030_6

Welcome!   
The competition between pharmacies is heating up.   
I've got to make my store more unique, or I'll be sunk.   
I'm doing my best to "pill" in the gaps, so drop by anytime and support my store!

Welcome!

I won't bother you with my stories. Take your time and browse.

Go on, don't be shy! Have a look around!

Welcome!   
Saturdays are our regular sale days! It's the perfect chance to stock up on supplies!

Gosh, is it sweltering. This kind of heat calls for some Aojiru Sorbet!   
...It's a product I tried pushing once, but it didn't sell. Apparently, people only used it for dares...   
But enough of that! Take your time and do some browsin'!

My pharmacy's detoxifier is famous! It sucks the poison outta ya like a healing vacuum cleaner.   
Girlfriends' pimples, wives' sharp tongues... It can cure anything!   
Got anyone around who won't stop naggin' ya? Give it a try on them! Gahahahah!

You don't want to become overly reliant on meds. Excess can turn tonics into toxins, ya know.   
Even in an emergency, make sure to follow the instructions on the label, capeesh?   
Anyway, what catches your eye?

Vitamins and mineral water are common shopping items these days.   
Things like that used to be taken for granted, but not now. Which helps my business, but it's sad...   
That's enough of that, though. Take your time and look around!

Back in the good ol' days, every household had an aloe plant for their health.   
Thanks to that, I've never been constipated in my life! Gahahah!   
Enough about me, though. Browse to your heart's content!

I hear more people have been carrying their meds around in pill cases in case they suddenly get sick.   
It's good to be prepared, but we have traditions... Don't people remember what an inro is...?   
Shoot, listen to me lecturin' you like an old-timer. Forget what I said. Have a look around!

I got this great concoction from Ken-chan, my wholesaler! They say it enhances... Heheheh...   
Well, not that I have anyone to use it on. Huh... I wonder how she's doing these days...   
Whoa, that's not the type of talk for your ears, is it? Anyway, have a look around.

This area's getting more dangerous. Someone even broke into our storage basement a bit ago.   
But I bet he had the scare of a lifetime once he saw what was inside! Heheheh...   
Now then, peruse away!

Come to think of it, Elizabeth said that   
she wanted to try some tasty aojiru...   
I might be able to find some here...   
   
Aohige Pharmacy Owner   
Hey, kid. What can I get you today?

I'd like some aojiru.   
Do you sell aojiru?   
   
Aohige Pharmacy Owner   
Oh, sorry, I don't have any for sale right now.   
I used to, but it didn't sell well and was apparently only used for dares...   
That said... I did recently come up with a new aojiru creation that I consider my magnum opus.   
And maybe I'd be willing to exchange it for the  from the antique shop next door...   
Haha, I'm joking! That thing's way out of a student's budget.   
Sorry, but you'll have to give up on the aojiru. But don't worry, I've got plenty of other fine goods!   
   
Aohige Pharmacy Owner   
......   
That  from next door would really help streamline things...   
But she probably won't sell it to me... What to do...?   
Whoops, don't mind me. Just talkin' to myself. Take your time and look around!   
   
Aohige Pharmacy Owner   
Hey, kid. What's up? Wait, is that...?   
The ! How the hell'd you get your hands on this!?

I made an exchange for it.   
Trade secret.   
   
Aohige Pharmacy Owner   
Uh, I see... Well, as long as you didn't break any laws, I'm not gonna pry.   
Anyhow, I'm impressed with your dedication. Well, I won't go back on my word... This is yours!   
   
Aohige Pharmacy Owner   
If you ever want more, just say the word. This isn't for sale, but I'll make an exception for you.   
Oh, and I'll be making full use of the  for my future research.   
Bottom line, thanks a ton! You take your time lookin' around, now!

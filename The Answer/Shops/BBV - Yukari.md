This is that one place that claims to "cleanse your soul" with healing stones and stuff, right?

Yukari Takeba
We can drop in, I guess... I mean, we already came all the way here, so might as well.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Oh, this place...

Yukari Takeba
Sure, I'll go in, I guess. They "cleanse your soul" with healing stones or something, right?

Yukari Takeba
We already came all the way here, after all. Not like I have any reason to say no.

Yukari Takeba
Surprised - Huh? This place again? You must really like it here...

Yukari Takeba
I don't mind stopping by. Besides... It means I can finally get a moment to rest.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - ...Wow, I totally just passed out. You know, it's kind of a weird feeling, considering time's not really moving forward.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - I guess I was just that exhausted. So, um... thanks for inviting me.

Yukari Takeba
Exasperated* - ...Wow, I completely passed out. Just like last time.

Yukari Takeba
You know, he brought me here before. I don't remember much from back then, though—since I was asleep the whole time.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Anyway, I don't know if my soul is actually getting "cleansed" or whatever, but... thanks for inviting me.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - That was a pretty good nap...

Yukari Takeba
Happy - No idea if it actually "cleansed my soul," though, since I was passed out the whole time.

Yukari Takeba
Happy - Well, thanks for inviting me. See you around.

It's almost nighttime... I should

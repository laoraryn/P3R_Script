Happy - Hehe, I'm so happy I get to come to a place like this with you!

Metis
Surprised - But what's this about "healing stones" "cleansing the soul"? I can't wrap my head around it...

Metis
Happy - Not that it really matters. I'm fine with anything as long as I'm with you! I'll go check it out now!

Metis
Happy - I'm so glad we get to go somewhere together again! Thank you for inviting me here.

Metis
Happy - Okay, time to head in. I'll be right back!

Metis
Sad - I feel like... I fell into a deep, deep sleep. What a strange sensation.

Metis
Is this how you and your friends usually spend time together?

Metis
Happy - It's nice to experience these kinds of things with someone else. Thank you again for inviting me!

Metis
Happy - *yawn* I was fast asleep again... But that was a really refreshing nap!

Metis
Happy - The best part is, when I wake up, I get to come out and see you waiting for me, hehe!

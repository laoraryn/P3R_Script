Kenji Tomochika   
Yo, Arisato.   
Sad - I was just about to head home, but I don't really feel up to walking...   
Happy - Hey, don't get the wrong idea. I'm not gonna go looking for an unlocked bicycle, alright?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Oh, Arisato.   
Sad - I was just about to head to cram school, but I don't really feel up to walking there...   
Happy - Hey, don't get the wrong idea. I'm not gonna go looking for an unlocked bicycle, alright?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Oh! Hey, Arisato.   
If I'm gonna buy a gift for a girl, I should probably get her a bouquet of flowers, right?   
Happy - I bet if I bought something like that, we'd get a lot closer.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Oh, what's up, Arisato?   
Hey, if you were gonna give someone a present, what would it be?   
Hm, I think Emiri would love a bouquet of roses...   
Happy - I bet if I gave her something like that, we'd get a lot closer.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Hey, Arisato. You studyin' for exams?   
Happy - I'm headin' home. It'd be straight up embarrassin' if I didn't pass.   
Sad - Yeah, yeah, I know I should study regularly, but I got other priorities, you know?   
Happy - Maybe I could study in the library, but I can't really deal with the atmosphere in there.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Yo, what's up, Arisato?   
I'm feelin' pretty good, man.   
Happy - Hey, promise me you'll do whatever you want, whenever you want while we're still young, alright?   
Happy - ...I'll always have your back, dude.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel an unbreakable bond   
with Tomochika...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Yo, Arisato.   
Sad - If you're gonna give your girl a present, it's gotta be flowers, right? Well, not like I have anyone special in my life anymore.   
Happy - But I bet if I gave a girl some kinda gift, we'd get closer in no time.   
Exasperated* - Man... If only the girl of my dreams would show up right in front of me.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Hey, 'sup? I'm gonna head out soon. How 'bout you?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It looks like Tomochika wants to hang out.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Yo...   
Sad - I wanna talk to you for a sec.   
Sad - Don't worry, it won't take long.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - Dude, this isn't good.   
Sad - I-I-I...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend some time after   
school with Tomochika?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Meet with Tomochika   
Check Social Link status   
Not now   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Huh? You comin' with?   
Cool. Let's hang out then.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Surprised - Oh, seriously?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Angry - I guess I gotta tell you this someday...   
Angry - C'mon, let's head to the courtyard downstairs.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - Thanks...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - Let's go somewhere we can talk in private...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Exasperated* - Oh, you got something planned?   
Alright, later.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Oh, Arisato.   
...I was just thinking. I bet Takeba-san has some pretty high standards, huh?   
You'd probably have to be a real Prince Charming if you wanna get her attention.   
Well... Not like it matters to me, anyway. I'm not really interested in her.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
...Oh yeah, totally random, but have you ever heard of the "Gourmet King"?   
Apparently, there's a "foodie" around here who's a cut above the rest.   
They say he's a student at our school.   
Wouldn't it be cool if he told us the best places to eat? I'd totally take a date there.   
I heard he's really into sandwiches now, so you could probably catch him eating one in town.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Tomochika gave me a lead   
on the "Gourmet King"...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Hm... I'd like to say I know my ramen, but the Gourmet King is on a whole 'nother level.   
Apparently, that guy knows about some secret menus, too. Like, he'll order rice bowls at Hagakure.   
Exasperated* - Rumor has it, he's been eating sandwiches in the middle of town... Just who the heck is this guy?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Hey... You wanna know the secret to a happy relationship with the girl you like?   
Normally, you'd just hang out, chat, and get to know each other better, right?   
But you gotta watch what you say. If you step on a landmine, it'll all go up in smoke.   
And when that happens, it's over, she's through. Usually, it won't be that bad, but still...   
If she does walk out on you... Hm, what should you do...?   
I guess you just gotta get on your hands and knees and beg for forgiveness. Even if it takes days.   
Not that I'd ever have to worry about that! Nobody knows Emiri better than me.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Anyways, I'm gonna head out soon. How 'bout you?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Oh, uh, by the way...   
Sad - I actually wanted to talk to you for a sec...   
Sad - Don't worry, it won't take long.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Uh, but never mind that. Dude, this is not good.   
I-I-I...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Whew, exams are finally over.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Oh, that reminds me! Exams are finally over, huh.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Whew, thank god. Looks like we both made it out alive!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Man, I studied my ass off for Emiri... Havin' a girlfriend sure is a big motivator, huh?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Man, I feel so tired all of a sudden...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Hey, 'sup, dude? I'm gonna head out soon. How 'bout you?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Anyways, I'm gonna head out soon. How 'bout you?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Huh? You comin' with?   
Then how 'bout we go out for ramen again? I wanna hear more about you, too.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
You headin' out? I got nothing to do today. Again...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
By the way, you headin' out? I got nothing to do today. Again...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Ooh, lucky me. Let's go somewhere then.   
...And it's gotta be you-know-where.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Hey, Arisato. You're headin' out, right?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - By the way, you're headin' out, right?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Perfect. In that case...   
Let's go to Wilduck. There's a lot I wanna talk about today.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - ......   
Exasperated* - O-Oh, Arisato. You wanna grab ramen, right? Sure.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Exasperated* - O-Oh, right. You wanna grab ramen, right? Sure.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
...Alright, let's go. Guess I'll get myself an extra-large special.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - Oh, Arisato...   
Sad - You got a sec? I need to talk to you.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - Hey, uh... You got a sec? I need to talk to you.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Thanks for makin' time for me. I appreciate it, man.   
Exasperated* - I'm not really in the mood for ramen today, so let's just head to Wilduck.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Exasperated* - ...Arisato.   
Exasperated* - If you got the time... could we talk?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Exasperated* - Oh, right. If you got the time... could we talk?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - ...Alright. Then today's ramen is on me.   
You're good with ramen, right? Yeah, let's do ramen.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Hey, 'sup?   
Happy - I got nothing to do today. If you're not busy, let's go get some ramen.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Man, I got nothing to do today. If you're free, let's go get some ramen.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Alright, let's go.   
Happy - I'mma get an extra-large special today and... Hm, should I also order a rice bowl?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Exasperated* - Oh, you have something to do, huh...?   
Alright, later.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Oh, you already got plans?   
Exasperated* - That sucks. Alright, laters.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - O-Oh, alright...   
Exasperated* - Aw man, what do I do now...?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Exasperated* - Oh, you have something to do, huh...?   
Alright, later.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Exasperated* - ...Oh, you gotta do something?   
Sad - See ya.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - Oh...   
Uh, it's cool, no worries. See you around.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - Oh, are you busy...?   
Sad - What am I supposed to do now...?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - Oh... Alright, maybe next time then.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - What, you got a date or somethin'?   
Happy - Alright, later.

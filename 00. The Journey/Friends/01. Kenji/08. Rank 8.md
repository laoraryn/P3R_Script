Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - H-Hey, man. Sorry to make you come here. I, um... Ah, damn it...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Spit it out!   
Are you in trouble?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - Ah, sorry... You're right.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Looking away - Y-Yeah. I... I...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Looking away - Dude, it's bad! I don't know what to do!   
Looking away - The school found out about Emiri and me! It blew up and became this huge thing...   
Looking away - And now she's being transferred to a school in Kyushu. What do I do!?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You should go with her.   
You two should talk it out.   
Figure it out yourself.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Angry - Yeah, yeah, that's what I was thinking! I mean, I want to...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - Only... Emiri said I can't.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Surprised - Yeah, man, that's what I thought!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - Except I feel like she's totally avoiding me...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - Wh-What the hell, dude!? You're the only one I can count on...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - It's like, all of a sudden, she won't answer my calls or reply to my texts.   
Sad - She's probably only doing this to protect me, but still...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Looking away - I can't just sit here and do nothing.   
Looking away - I gotta think of a plan. And I'm gonna need your help.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Tomochika opened up to   
me about his troubles.   
I feel like our relationship is stronger...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - I'll see ya soon. Thanks for hearing me out today.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I parted ways with Tomochika   
and went back to the dorm.

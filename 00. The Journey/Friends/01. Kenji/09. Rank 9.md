Hey, man. I was gonna wait to tell you this until we sit down to eat, but...   
I've decided to go to Kyushu with Emiri, so this'll be the last time we have ramen together.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Surprised - What the— Emiri!?   
Sad - Who's that she's with?   
   
Ms. Kanou's Voice   
...I didn't think he'd get so serious about it.   
He's just a kid. He must have misunderstood.   
   
Ms. Kanou's Voice   
I did it for my own track record as a teacher. He should be grateful...   
Seems like he's the one who spread the rumors.   
And now other students are...   
   
Man's Voice   
Just a little longer. We'll celebrate our wedding soon enough.   
   
Ms. Kanou's Voice   
I can't wait...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - Emiri...   
Sad - So I guess today was the day she was leaving.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - I had no idea...   
Sad - I was so excited about going with her that I... I...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Cheer up, man.   
Let me handle this!   
Haha.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - S-Stop it! Why are you trying to make me feel better? You should be laughing at me!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Looking away - Ugh! I'm such an idiot... A stupid, stupid idiot. I should've known this would happen!   
Looking away - It was so obvious she wasn't serious about me.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Surprised - It's fine, I'm okay! Thanks though, man.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - It's not Emiri's fault, anyway. I screwed things up.   
Looking away - Not her...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy tears* - Hahaha... It is kinda funny, isn't it? Ahh...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Crying - *sob*   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Crying - Why, Emiri...? Why!?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy tears* - Now my nose is running. Heh...   
Happy tears* - Thanks, Arisato. If you weren't here, I'd...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Tomochika is trying to tough out the pain.   
I feel like our relationship is stronger...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - Let's go home.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I decided to walk home with Tomochika.

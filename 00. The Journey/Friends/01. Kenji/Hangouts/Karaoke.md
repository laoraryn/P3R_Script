Sad - *cough* *cough* Too much singing. My throat's killin' me...   
Sad - ......   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
We won't be able to hang out like this for much longer. My school life's coming to an end...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
You know, I haven't really taken much seriously before, but... now that I'm getting married...   
Sad - Do you think I can make her happy?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You'll do fine.   
Just do your best.   
Probably not.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Yeah...   
Happy - I mean, plenty of couples are happy with their marriages, right? We just gotta be one of them.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Tomochika seems relieved...   
I learned a little more about him today.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Yeah, you're right. My best is all I can do!   
Happy - Thanks for the encouragement, dude.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Tomochika seems relieved...   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - C'mon, man! Show a little support!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Tomochika seems sad...   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Huh... This might actually be the last time we...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Uh, alright! Let's do something else! How 'bout the arcade?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
After hanging out with Tomochika for   
a while, I decided to go back to the dorm.

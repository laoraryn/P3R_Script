Happy - Dude, check it out! I finally got Mika's new single!   
Happy - Not only does she have a great voice, but she looks amazing when she's onstage, y'know?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Hey, I think this is the first time I've seen you not wearing a school uniform.   
Hmm...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Not bad... Not bad at all! But, there are some things you could do to look better...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's rude.   
Like what?   
Whatever...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Hahaha, my bad, my bad! I'm kind of obsessed with clothes.   
Happy - Some advice: make sure your school uniform is clean and pressed. That's how you look cool.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Tomochika opened up to   
me about his interests.   
I learned a little more about him today.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Oh, you wanna know?   
Well, for starters... Let's see, umm... Here, try this. Yeah, that looks better.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - You're pretty good-looking to begin with, so if you work on how you dress, you'll be good to go.   
Happy - Then, you can be my wingman!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Tomochika seems very excited.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - C'mon, man. We're in our prime right now! We shouldn't just let it slip by!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Tomochika seems disappointed...   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Maybe I'll buy something new to wear. You cool if we head over somewhere?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
After shopping with Tomochika,   
I decided to return to the dorm.

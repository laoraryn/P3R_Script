Nozomi Suemitsu   
Sad - Hurry, Minato-kun! I'm dying from hunger here!   
   
Bitter-Looking Man   
Well, look who it is. I knew you sounded familiar.   
I'd recognize that shrill, grating voice anywhere. I mean, who wouldn't?   
   
Bitter-Looking Man   
I don't have all the free time in the world like you high school kids, so let's try to keep this short.   
My son gave you money that was supposed to pay for his cram school. I'd appreciate it if you'd give it back.   
Let's just be done with this. I won't bother you again if you return the money now. Are we good?   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Um, look sir, I don't think you have the full picture here.   
Sad - Your son said he hates cram school! That's why he was hiding in the park by himself.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Angry - I was doing him a favor! If anything, you should be thanking me!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Right, Minato-kun?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's right.   
Sorry, what?   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Angry - See!? Minato-kun thinks so, too!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Angry - S-See? Minato-kun thinks so, too! ...In his heart, I hope.   
   
Bitter-Looking Man   
Well, what's this? Someone sure is bold today.   
You sure you're not gonna start screaming "emergency" and run away?   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
My, my, you really don't have a clue, do you? No wonder you don't understand how your son feels!   
Happy - Besides, haven't you heard? Minato-kun's my bodyguard now!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Suemitsu seems to trust   
me with all his heart.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Look, I should be the one forgiving you. And even if I did, there's no way you're getting into Paradise.   
People like my dead brother, nonbelievers like you—you're not welcome there!   
   
Bitter-Looking Man   
Talking to you gives me a headache.   
You know my son, right? He's still in elementary school, and yet he has a better head on his shoulders than you do.   
Your parents have my sympathy.   
I'd be ashamed if my son were as neck deep in this cult as you are.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Angry - Wh-What... What did you just say to me!?   
Angry - So that's how it is, huh!? You're just like the rest of them! You think I should've died instead, don't you!?   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Angry - You don't think I'll ever hold a candle to my twin brother, do you!?   
   
Bitter-Looking Man   
Kn-Knock it off! Damn kid...   
God, this has been such a waste of time. Fine, if that's how you want to play, then just you wait and see!   
   
Bitter-Looking Man   
Better watch yourself, kid. Hang around this guy for too long, and he'll scam you, too.   
I tell my son the same thing—choose your friends carefully.   
Now, excuse me.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Angry - Come back when you've learned a little respect! ...Ah, actually, don't come back! Ever!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Happy - We won! We fought that guy off! As long as you're here, I've got nothing to fear!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Happy - Oh, right! I was dying of hunger, wasn't I? Come on, Minato-kun!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
After eating with Suemitsu,   
I went back to the dorm.

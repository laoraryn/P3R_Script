Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The restaurant is filled with   
the familiar smell of fish.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
...Seven, eight, nine...   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Sad - Shoot, I'm coming up short on my counts. I have to find one more new person...   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Angry - Damn it all! Why doesn't anyone take me seriously?   
Angry - I'm not gonna lose to my brother again! I'll show him... I'll show them all!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Surprised - Wha—!? What's... going ooon?   
Hurt - Uggh... Hrrrghghh!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Suemitsu ran to the restroom!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Sad - It's over... The baby came out good and healthy.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Hey, c'mon, Minato-kun! It's your job to laugh at the Gourmet King's dumb jokes! Hohohohoho!   
Sad - I don't get it. I was fine up until a minute ago, then suddenly I felt sick.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Does this happen a lot?   
Did you eat too much?   
Are you sick?   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Happy - Yeah, every once in a while, my body sort of "rewinds" the meal on me.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Angry - ...The words "overeating" and "leftovers" do NOT exist in my vocabulary!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Happy - What do you mean? Look at all the nutrition I'm taking in! I'm the paragon of health... Well, except for this gut.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Happy - Hey, don't you worry about me. This is a trial I have to face before I'm reborn, anyway.   
If I want my place in Paradise after this world ends, I have to prove my worth.   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Happy - It'd mean a lot to me if you considered, uh... coming to Paradise with me, too.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Suemitsu seems comfortable   
having me as a friend.   
I feel like our relationship is stronger...   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Surprised - Gah! The noodles got soggy while my stomach was giving me trouble!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
You'll have to wait till next time to hear about Paradise!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Happy - But for now, let's just focus on our ramen!   
   
Nozomi Suemitsu   
Happy - Sir! Can I get some rice and dry seaweed!? I'll salvage this ramen by turning it into a rice soup!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I finished my meal with Suemitsu   
and went back to the dorm.

Did you get this?   
   
   
Cell phones sure are convenient, aren't they? :)   
Anyway, are you free? I'd like to invite you somewhere.   
I'll be waiting for you in the classroom.

Hey there   
   
   
I had a lot of fun this afternoon. Did you? :)   
What are you doing right now? Do you have a minute?   
I'm actually in front of your room.

Sorry for the short notice, but I need to see you right now.

Looks like Ryoji wants to hang out...   
Should I meet up with him?

Meet with Ryoji   
Not now

Let's head to where Ryoji is.

Ryoji is acting weird... I should head   
to the **music room** later.

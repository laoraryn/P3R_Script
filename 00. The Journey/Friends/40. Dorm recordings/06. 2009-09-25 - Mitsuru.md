...!?   
It looks like Mitsuru's room...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Whew...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Oh... I've gotten used to walking around without my bathrobe lately.   
Not a very good habit to fall into...   
Well. I'm away from home, so it's no big deal, I suppose...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
This fashion magazine... I thought I'd take a look after I saw Takeba purchasing one...

Mitsuru Kirijo   
"256 snazzy looks to knock the socks off of your BFFs!"...   
"Get her look! Sweet but glam do's and don'ts"...   
......   
What is this even saying?   
I don't follow fashion myself... I usually wear whatever the family stylist selects for me.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
"The cutest essentials"...   
W-Well... I would be open to trying this pink one...   
......   
Heh... Not that it would suit me anyway. I'm no Takeba.   
I should remember there's a difference between what appeals to me and what I can actually pull off.

...Achoo!   
Not good... I'm going to catch a cold.   
I should turn in... I have to be up early again tomorrow.

Now, which pajamas shall I wear tonight?

It looks like Sanada's room...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Ugh, dammit... I still can't stop thinking about what happened in Yakushima...   
Angry - You're telling me I can't carry a conversation any better than Junpei?   
Angry - How can I be on the same level as that idiot and his lame pickup lines?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
"Are you able to make others laugh with a well-timed joke?"   
Sad - Well... No specific examples come to mind, but I think I at least do that much.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
"Careful: Making others laugh and being laughed at are two entirely different things!"   
Sad - ......   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
"When people speak to you, do you tend to respond with pure logic and reason?"   
"This is a common mistake among inarticulate men. Try to consider what the other party is feeling first."   
......   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hurt - Dammit. I guess they've got a point...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
"Try practicing by imagining you're asking a female friend or colleague to your favorite store."   
"Remember, it's important to smile and have a sense of humor!"   
......   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Um... H-Hey there! Uh... What great timing to see you here! Nice one!   
Happy - I'm going to Umiushi, wanna come with?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Oh... Humor... Humor...   
Sad - Y-Y'know, the beef bowl place... H-Hey... M-Maybe we could "meat" up there... Get it!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Very angry* - Arrrgh...!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - What am I, the chairman!?   
Angry - Screw this!

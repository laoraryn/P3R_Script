Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
...!?   
It looks like Junpei's room...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
This way, Officer.   
By the time I noticed the door was halfway open, his room was already like this.   
I've left the place untouched, as you requested.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
......   
Whose room is this?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Junpei Iori. A second-year student.   
I've been trying to reach him on his cell phone, but he hasn't responded in the last half hour.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - It was careless of me to let my guard down. This dorm was attacked once in the past.   
Sad - Perhaps Iori himself is at fault here, however, if harm has fallen upon him, as head of SEES I am accountable...   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
I hate to say it, Kirijo-san, but he most likely—   
   
   
Voice from Outside   
Huh? Kirijo-senpai?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Wh-What the hell!? Kurosawa-san? What's going on here!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Iori!?   
Surprised - Where were you? I've been trying get a hold of you!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Huh? Oh, uh... It was hot and the AC was busted, so I went to the manga café, but I fell asleep.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Well, I'm just glad you're safe.   
So if it wasn't an attack, then it must have been theft. Why would the burglar target this room?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Burglar!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What else could it be? Someone clearly ransacked the place looking for something.   
Angry - Vandalizing a school dorm... When I find out who did this, I'll see to it that they face a swift execution.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
Well, son, sounds like you've got a death sentence.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
How about it, Iori? Was this room really vandalized?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Ah, uhhh, well...   
Sad - This is... how my room always looks?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Wh-What!?   
Sad - But, I mean...   
Sad - You can't possibly live like this, can you!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Wh-What about the door? It was open.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Oh, that? I was just airin' the place out while I was gone. No one we don't know ever comes around, so...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ......   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
I think this case is closed. May I get back to my duties now, young lady?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Oh, y-yes.   
Exasperated* - I'm... sorry you had to witness something so disgraceful.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - ...!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - I apologize for all this.   
Sad - It seems I grew up more sheltered than I realized.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - You're not even gonna yell at me!?   
Surprised - And what's the deal with callin' the cops over a messy room, anyway!?   
Surprised - The hell did I do to deserve this!?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Hey, wait...   
Sad - I drew that "Worst Luck" fortune on the way back...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts

Mamoru Hayase   
Glad we could meet up one more time before I take off.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
"Take off"?   
You're leaving today?   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - I told you last time, right? I'm getting a job.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Always sharp as a tack. Yup, I'm leaving right after this.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
The factory is way out west, so I'm moving into a dorm there.   
I've already sent my luggage. Now I just gotta send myself.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
My mom started crying and blaming herself.   
Happy - But I'm the one who wants to do this.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
This is a new chapter in my life.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Guess I should say goodbye to this ramen, too.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Well then, I better get going...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'll see you off.   
Let's chat a bit more.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sure, then let's head to the station.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sorry, but it's time to go.   
But how 'bout you come see me off at the station?

Mamoru Hayase   
Hey, Arisato. Here, take this.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Looks like a car key...   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
I want you to hang on to that.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What's this for?   
But I can't drive yet.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - Well, it's a car key, obviously. But it's not just any car key...   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - It's okay, there's no car to drive.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
It's the key to my dad's car. I've been keeping it for good luck.   
Sometimes I get pretty pissed that he's not around anymore.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - My life wouldn't have been so complicated, y'know?   
Sad - I could've enjoyed track more. I wouldn't have had all that pressure to be the best.   
Sad - But by blaming him like that, I was just running away from my problems.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
That's why I want you to have it.   
I don't want to risk running away again.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - But if I know you have it, I'll be able to stand on my own two feet.   
Happy - Then next time we meet, I can still be proud of who I am.

......   
Thank you, Arisato.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hayase seems to really care about me.   
I've gained a lifelong friend!

The Star Social Link reached its maximum level! You can now fuse **Helel**, the light-bearer!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
We'll see each other again someday.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I saw Hayase off and   
went back to the dorm.

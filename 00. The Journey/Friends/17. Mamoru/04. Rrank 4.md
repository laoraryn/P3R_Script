Angry - ......   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - ...All right, just one more!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What are you doing?   
Slow down and savor it.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Oh, uh, eating fast is kinda my thing.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Oh, sorry. Eating fast is kinda my thing.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - If you don't eat quick at my place, my siblings'll pick everything clean.   
Happy - Haha, don't worry, your food's safe. Take your time.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - That was almost a personal best for me!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Oh, get this, Arisato. I've got a race lined up at another school.   
A coach from a big-time athletic college is gonna be there.   
Happy - Know what that means? If I do well enough, I might score a scholarship.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That would be amazing!   
What's the big deal?   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Right!? Then I could keep doing track.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Surprised - Are you serious!? It's a scholarship!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - I get it... You do go to Gekkoukan. I guess a rich kid wouldn't understand.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
I'd pretty much given up on going to college.   
Sad - We just don't have that kind of money.   
Then I heard about the chance for a scholarship, so you can imagine why I jumped on it, right?   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Angry - I'm gonna win this thing and go to college!   
And maybe... this'll make my mom's life a little easier.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Hard to say.   
Yeah, I bet it would.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - Right... I guess we really do come from different worlds.   
Sad - You probably have a hard time relating to poor families like mine.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Yeah, you're right. It's a relief to hear you say that.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
I always think how different things would be if my dad were still alive.   
Sad - If he were here, my siblings wouldn't have to worry about whether or not they'd get to eat every day.   
Sad - ......   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Well, complaining won't accomplish anything. I'm just gonna have to try for that scholarship.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hayase is seriously   
thinking about his future.   
Hayase opened up to   
me about his problems.   
I feel like we're getting closer...   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Surprised - Shoot! The sale on chicken is almost over, and it's my turn to cook tonight!   
I'll catch you later.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I decided to go back to the dorm.

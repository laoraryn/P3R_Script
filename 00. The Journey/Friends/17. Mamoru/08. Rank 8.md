Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - This is sooo good!   
I am so lucky I get to eat such amazing food.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - Should I bring some home? If I do, I'd have to pay for it...   
Sad - Hmm...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Do it!   
I could spot you some cash.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Yeah, I will! It feels wrong being the only one who gets to eat.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Nah, it's fine. I should be able to cover it.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Oh, by the way, about my mom...   
Happy - She's gonna be out of the hospital soon!   
Just when I was finally getting the hang of taking care of everyone myself.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
And guess what else! My teammates offered to help me with the kids, too.   
They even said they'd pick my sister up from preschool.   
I guess everyone's been worried about me.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - And there I was—total tunnel vision—trying to do everything on my own.   
Sad - In the end, maybe it was my fault the team couldn't work together.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It sure was.   
Don't sweat it.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Haha, you really don't mince words, huh?   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Haha. Honestly, that's reassuring to hear from you.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
I feel a lot better about everything now that I know how everyone really feels.   
Happy - I'm having fun just running laps! My body feels light as a feather now.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Oops, guess I kinda started rambling there.   
Sorry, but I gotta get going. Take it easy, Arisato.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
And don't forget—   
   
I'm only able to focus on training again 'cause you had my back! And I feel great, so thanks, buddy.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hayase really spoke from the heart.   
I feel like we're getting closer...   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Later!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I decided to go back to the dorm.

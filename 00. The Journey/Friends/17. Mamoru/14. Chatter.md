Mamoru Hayase   
Hey, Arisato. You remembered me, huh?   
I'm gonna grab a bite to eat. Wanna join me?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure.   
Not today.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Let's see who can eat faster... The loser has to run a hundred laps around the city! Ready?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hayase is full of confidence...   
I don't have the    
to accept his challenge...   
If I were at least  enough,   
I'd feel better about my chances.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Oh, not feeling up to it? All right, just let me know if you change your mind.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
All right, see you later, then.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Hey, Arisato. You remembered me, huh?   
Happy - I'm gonna grab a bite to eat. Wanna join me?   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Yo, I've been waiting for you, Arisato.   
Happy - Come on, let's go grab a bite to eat.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure.   
Not today.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Let's see who can eat faster... The loser has to run a hundred laps around the city! Ready?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hayase is full of confidence...   
But I can feel the    
welling up within me to face him.   
I can take him on!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - All right. Later, then.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Hey, Arisato. What's up?   
Happy - Wanna grab some chow?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hayase invited me to eat with him.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Oh, Arisato...   
Sad - I've actually got some shopping to do... You wanna tag along?   
Sad - My little bro's been begging me to pick up some new tunes for him, but I don't know much about music... I could really use your help.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - ...Oh, Arisato. I wish I could grab a bite with you, but I can't today.   
Sad - I actually need to talk to you. Do you mind joining me?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend some time   
after school with Hayase?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend the day with Hayase?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Spend time with him   
Check Social Link status

Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Sweet! Let's go!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Cool, let's go! I'm going hard on the meat today...   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
...Oh, actually, you go on ahead.   
I'm not done working out yet, but I'll be right there.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Oh, great!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
There's a music store in Paulownia Mall, right? You mind going ahead?   
I'm gonna finish working out first. It shouldn't take long.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - Thanks, I owe you one...   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Let's head somewhere else. Maybe the shrine...   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
All right. Later, man.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Oh, you're down? All right, then...   
Happy - How 'bout we get some ramen? Since you're already here and all.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Hey, how've you been? I'm in top form today.   
I got in thirty laps around this area, but now I'm starving.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Sweet! Then let's get some grub.   
Happy - I'm in the mood for some meat today!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Oh, it's you.   
Happy - You look hungry. Or maybe it's just me.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Great, then let's eat!   
Oh, but I'm kinda in a hurry today, so let's just get some takoyaki.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Oh, hey there, Arisato.   
I was just about to grab a bite. How about you?   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Oh, Arisato.   
Happy - I was feeling hungry, but I wanted to wait for you. I was hoping we could eat together.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Cool, let's go!   
Happy - Let's get some takoyaki today. I want some fresh off the stove.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Hey, Arisato. Wanna grab something to eat?   
There's something I wanted to talk to you about. Are you free right now?   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Great, then let's get some ramen! Today, I'm gonna go with the special, extra-large!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Hey, Arisato!   
I've been waiting for you. Were you gonna go eat something just now?   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Cool. Now, what should we get...?   
Happy - Can't go wrong with ramen. I don't think I'll ever get tired of it.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
All right. Maybe next time.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Oh, you're busy? Well, come see me any time, then.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Oh, you already ate? Invite me next time, all right?   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
I see. Maybe next time, then.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - Oh, I see... That's too bad.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - Gotcha... That's fine. Let's try for another time.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - Guess we'll just have to try for next time.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
All right. Maybe next time, then.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - I see...   
Next time, then. It's a promise.

Mamoru Hayase   
So, uh, the big meet for that scholarship was yesterday.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Did you win?   
Did you lose?   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Are you seriously asking me that?   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Hey, who do you think you're talking to?   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - I got first place, of course!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Wow, really?   
Congrats, man!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Angry - Why so surprised? What, you don't believe me?   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Well, what'd you expect!? But really, thanks.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Guess this means it's really over. Running track, I mean.   
Kinda makes me feel empty inside.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What will you do now?   
Will you quit running?   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
I'm thinking of finding a job, actually.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Not to sound dramatic, but I wanna do it to protect my family.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Like I said, I don't have any regrets. Plus, there's something I need to do.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Not to sound dramatic, but I wanna do it to protect my family.   
So I'm thinking I'll get a job. We'll need it to survive.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
I know where, too. My dad had connections at a car factory, so I'll apply there.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Thing is, it's pretty far away.   
Sad - ......   
Go ahead and order extra noodles. It's on me.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Thanks!   
Don't put yourself out!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Yeah! Eat as much as you want!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - I knew you'd make a thing out of it. Seriously, don't sweat it!   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
You helped me figure a bunch of things out, y'know.   
I always blamed school or my family for everything. I was using it as an escape from my own responsibilities...   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
I really lucked out by meeting you. If I hadn't, I'd still be stuck in that same hole.   
And I'll never forget that.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hayase opened up to   
me about his decision.   
I feel like we're getting closer...   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - Well, I better start packing. Got a lot of goodbyes to get through and not enough time.   
We should grab a bite again after school soon. Who knows how many chances we'll get after this?   
Ramen's just too good to pass up, right?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hayase and I chatted until it got late.

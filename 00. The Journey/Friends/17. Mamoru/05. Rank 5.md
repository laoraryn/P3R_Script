Sad - *huff* *huff* Sorry I kept you waiting...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You're late.   
Are you okay?   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - ...Sorry.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - Yeah... Sorry. Guess I need to train more.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - ...Let's go in. I'm super thirsty.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
That was great. I always say food tastes better with a buddy.   
Sad - I used to come here all the time with my teammates, but...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
But what?   
I'll come back here with you.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Angry - They wouldn't come now even if I invited them.   
Angry - I don't really get along with people who don't take the sport seriously.   
Sad - We even started training at different times. Nothing's organized anymore.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Happy - You're the only one who says that anymore.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Sad - Anyway, they wouldn't come now even if I invited them.   
Sad - I don't really get along with people who don't take the sport seriously.   
Sad - We even started training at different times. Nothing's organized anymore.   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
I used to love it there, you know? I spent all my time on the track, practicing and training.   
Sad - We all loved track and had so much fun together, but then...   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Ah, never mind. It doesn't matter. We're too different, them and me.   
Angry - I'm going to reach heights they never will. I have to...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hayase's really passionate about his sport.   
I feel like we're getting closer...   
   
Mamoru Hayase   
Surprised - Sorry, that... That was a weird conversation.   
I think I'll do lunges the whole way home.   
Happy - You keep at it, too. No slowing down!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I decided to go back to the dorm.

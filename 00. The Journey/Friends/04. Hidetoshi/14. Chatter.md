Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Ah, Arisato-kun.   
There's no meeting today... My day just doesn't feel right without one.   
Don't you agree?   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Ah, Arisato-kun.   
I'm still in the middle of my investigation. Let me know if you find anything.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Ah, Arisato-kun.   
You know, I realized something recently...   
Part of my job is to think about how we can truly help the student body.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Ah, it's you.   
You know, I realized something recently...   
Part of my job is to think about how we can truly help the student body.   
...Anyway, how have you been doing? If you're ever in trouble, I'll be happy to help.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel an unbreakable bond   
with Odagiri...   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
I've been waiting for you, Arisato-kun.   
If you're planning to attend today's meeting, I could use your help with something...   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Excellent. I owe you for this.   
I'd like to do a little presentation to help raise awareness on the student council.   
Happy - I'll do most of the talking, so if you wouldn't mind supporting me.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
I see...   
Maybe another day, then. Whenever you can spare the time.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Ah, Arisato-kun. Now that exams are over, we can take a moment to relax.   
Happy - As such, the student council will be resuming their activities as well.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
I apologize for the abrupt timing, but...   
If you're going to be at today's meeting, I could use your help with something...

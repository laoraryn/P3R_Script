All right, everyone. This is who I've been talking to you about. He'll be joining us in student council starting today.   
   
Disciplinary Committee Rep.   
Ah, so he's Arisato-kun.   
I'm Hidetoshi Odagiri. I supervise the disciplinary committee.   
   
Treasurer   
I'm Chihiro Fushimi, the treasurer.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
I'm a first-year, and um, I'm still learning the ropes, so please be patient with me, Arisato-san.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Nice to meet you.   
I'll do my best.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
......   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
You must be quite talented to be hand-picked by the president herself.   
I look forward to working with you.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
I would certainly hope so.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I think I made a good   
impression on Odagiri.   
I joined the student council and   
got to know the members.   
I hope I get along with everyone here...

It's getting late. Introductions will be enough for today.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What we want from you is to assist us as necessary.   
From now on, you have my permission to enter the student council room whenever you wish.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Your time is your own after school, but try to remember the student council every now and then.   
We meet on **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays**. But we don't meet on days before tests.   
Thanks for coming today, Arisato.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I parted ways with the student council   
members and went back to the dorm.

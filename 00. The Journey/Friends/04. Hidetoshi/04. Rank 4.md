Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I spent some time working   
with the student council.   
The hours flew by as I   
worked hard on my tasks.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I don't see Odagiri. Is he absent today?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Um, no... I'm pretty sure he came to school today.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Then where is he?   
   
Secretary   
Probably busy playing Detective Asshole.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Ah, so this is what Fushimi was telling me about... I see.   
Sad - Well, his intentions are good, so you can't really blame him. But I understand how you feel.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Ah, you're all free to leave now. Good work today.

Shady Student   
You hear me!? I wanna see evidence, smart guy!   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Angry - I don't need evidence. I already know everything about you.   
Angry - Like how you were arrested for beating up that guy in the park who snitched on you, right?   
   
Bemused Student   
Whoa! He's still at it? This is the third time today.   
   
Amused Student   
My boyfriend was so pissed after he was accused. This guy's really asking for it.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Keeping quiet will only make things worse for you.   
If it's really not you, then give me some names.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
And don't worry, I won't tell anyone. You have my word as a member of the disciplinary committee.   
   
Shady Student   
Better fuck off, asshole...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This guy looks like he's   
about to hit Odagiri!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Knock it off!   
......   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Closed eyes, concentrating - Ngh...   
   
Shady Student   
God, what a shitty day.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Closed eyes, concentrating - Tch... Don't think I'll just let you get away with that!   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Determined - Oh, hey, Arisato-kun.   
Determined - What is it? Did you need something from me?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You went a little overboard.   
Looks like you're hard at work.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Determined - You think so?   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Closed eyes, concentrating - Some people will lie and stab you in the back without hesitation if it benefits them.   
Closed eyes, concentrating - People like that are a menace to society. Should we tolerate that kind of behavior? No, we should do something about it.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Determined - You bet I am.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Determined - If we turn a blind eye here, there's no stopping this from happening again.   
Determined - And once it spirals out of control, there'll be nothing we can do. We should nip this problem in the bud while we still can.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Faceplate down - ...I know what people think of me.   
Faceplate down - Then again, those who fight for justice have always butted heads with others. History speaks for itself.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Determined - So let my actions serve as a warning to other offenders. A sensible person like you should understand, right?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Seems like Odagiri's starting to trust me.   
I feel like we're becoming better friends.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Determined - I'm going to keep at it for now. You should head home before it gets dark.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I parted ways with Odagiri   
and went back to the dorm.

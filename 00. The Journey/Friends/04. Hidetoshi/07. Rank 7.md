Regarding the incident from the other day with the cigarette butt in the boys' bathroom...   
It seems the teachers want the student expelled as soon as we find out who it is.

Surprised - What?   
   
(SE) Secretary   
Well, I guess we should've expected that.

It does hurt the school's reputation.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Sad - I'll keep everyone posted on this. That's all for now.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Sad - Expulsion, huh...   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
So what do you think about all of this?   
Sad - About the smoker's punishment, I mean.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It seems reasonable.   
It seems too harsh.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Sad - I think... it's a little too harsh.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Sad - Once I catch the culprit, I'll give him a good talking-to. The goal here should be to prevent this from happening again.   
Sad - I'm not counting on it, but it'd be great if I could get people like him to change their ways.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Sad - Yes, I think so, too.

Sad - I don't sympathize with students who break the rules, but...   
Sad - Does kicking the "bad" kids out really make the school a better place?   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Sad - It's really not like me to whine about it. I guess I'm just confused because I feel so powerless.   
If I can go above and beyond this time and earn the teacher's trust, my word will hold more weight around here.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
Just you watch, Arisato-kun. I'll work my way to the top.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Odagiri really opened up to me.   
I feel like we're becoming better friends.   
   
Hidetoshi Odagiri   
I still have some work left to do. I need to compile a list of suspects.   
You can head on out of here. And take care.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I left the student council room   
and went back to the dorm.

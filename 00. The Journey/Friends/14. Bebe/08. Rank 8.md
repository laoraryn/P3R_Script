Angry - Sewing is my life...   
Sad - My wallet may be light, and my materials may be cheap...   
   
Bebe   
But I will work hard to make a beautiful kimono and save my future!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I helped Bebe work on the kimono.   
   
Bebe   
Hmm... Oui, this is starting to come together! Manzoku!   
   
Bebe   
Happy - When my uncle sees this, I know he'll agree with me about how great Nihon is!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
When will it be done?   
He'll definitely agree!   
Less talk, more work.   
   
Bebe   
It's far from being finished...   
So I must work even harder!   
   
Bebe   
Happy - I believe you, Minato-dono! Which means I must work even harder!   
   
Bebe   
Sad - I don't have the ability to stay that focused.   
   
Bebe   
Angry - But I know I can work harder than this!   
   
Bebe   
Happy - I made so much progress today! And I could not have done it without your help!   
   
Bebe   
Happy - Merci! Arigato! Thank you!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Bebe seems truly grateful.   
I feel like we're growing closer...   
   
Bebe   
Sad - Oooh... My arms are so very tired.   
Sad - I must have overworked them.   
Sad - But no matter what the cost, I will finish this kimono!   
   
Bebe   
Angry - For my future, for Nihon... I cannot give up now!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I spent the day helping Bebe   
then went back to the dorm.

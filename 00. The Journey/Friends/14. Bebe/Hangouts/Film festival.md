Let's go find our seats, Minato-dono!   
   
Wanderer Brother   
Ah, my soeur. How have you been? I'm finally back home, so how about some tea?   
   
Younger Sister   
Mon frère! You left three months ago! Where have you been, you bum?   
   
Wanderer Brother   
Oh, Mont-Saint-Michel, Versailles... I've built quite the reputation as a romantic.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
......   
That was a fun movie! And I   
picked up a little French, too.   
   
Bebe   
Happy - How nostalgic! I haven't seen my home country in quite some time.   
Well then, let us make our way home!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I parted ways with Bebe   
and went back to the dorm.

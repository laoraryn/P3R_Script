Bebe   
I am feeling a little hungry. Shall we get something to—   
   
   
Bebe   
Happy - Oh my! This wonderful fragrance!   
   
Bebe   
Happy - Just as I thought! It is takoyaki!   
Sad - Hmmm, I would like to buy some, but...   
Sad - I would prefer to first try takoyaki from its origin—in Osaka.   
   
Bebe   
Happy - ...I know! We can go there now! It is just a train ride away, is it not?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure, let's go.   
What a hassle...   
Just get it here.   
   
Bebe   
Happy - Many thanks—katajikenai! Then let us prepare for the journ—   
   
Surprised - ...Ah.   
Sad - I had forgotten I am low on funds... My deepest apologies, Minato-dono.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Bebe looks disappointed...   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Bebe   
Sad - Ah, alas...   
Sad - If you do not wish to go, then I shall forgo this dream. It would be too lonely to journey alone...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Bebe looks dejected...   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Bebe   
Sad - Alas...   
I suppose I must accept defeat this time.   
To tell you the truth, my funds have... ah, run dry. I do not believe I can make a trip...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Bebe looks embarrassed...   
I learned a little more about him today...   
   
Bebe   
Happy - I would still like to go to Osaka one day. When the time comes, I ask that you be my guide, Minato-dono!   
Happy - Now then... Let us march! To Octopia! Onwards!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
After talking with Bebe over takoyaki,   
I headed back to the dorm.

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Did you know part of the Kirijo name comes from the character for "paulownia tree"?   
I looked online, and since this mall belongs to the Kirijo Group, it was actually named after them.   
I think the Kirijo Group is also the parent organization of our school.   
Interesting, huh?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, by the way...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There's something I want to ask you...   
I was talking to the owner of Aohige Pharmacy about cooking...   
Sad - And he told me to try using dried snake meat as an ingredient... Can you believe that?   
Um... If I did make a dish with dried snake meat, would you still eat it, Arisato-kun?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure I would.   
You don't have to.   
It's up to you.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Huh...? Wait, really? D-Do I have to cook something with a snake?   
Surprised - But, if you really want me to, then...   
Exasperated* - ......   
Exasperated* - ...I'm sorry. I don't think I can do it. The thought of touching a snake, dead or alive, is terrifying.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Fuuka seems to be having fun.   
I learned a little more about her today.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Y-Yeah, I think I won't.   
Happy - I was worried you'd say that you want to try it...   
Exasperated* - I don't think I could cook snake meat, honestly... I'd be too afraid to touch it.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Fuuka seems relieved.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Then, I'd rather not...   
Sad - I mean, have you ever seen dried snake meat!?   
Sad - It has the texture of a Shadow, and it's the size of a hose on a fire truck...   
Sad - There's no way I'm bringing something like that back to the dorm with me! I can't even bear to touch it!   
Sad - ......   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Fuuka is teary-eyed...   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
What's another ingredient that could substitute snake meat? Eel, maybe?   
But the texture might still feel too similar to a snake. I don't know that I could bring myself to touch that either...   
Happy - Maybe I could find some options at a fish market. Do you want to come with me, Arisato-kun?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
We went shopping for ingredients   
before returning to the dorm.

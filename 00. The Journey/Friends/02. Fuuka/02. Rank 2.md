Fuuka Yamagishi   
I made another bento.   
Would you mind trying some of it?   
I think this one should taste better.   
Sad - ...Or at the very least, it can't be any worse than last time, right?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Judging by appearances, it   
does look like she's improved.   
I'll give it a try...   
   
Stray Cat   
Meow.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh, a kitty cat!   
Happy - Aw, he's so cute. I did hear there were lots of strays around here.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - He's looking at the bento box. I wonder if he's hungry...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Maybe I should give him some food. What do you think, Arisato-kun?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure.   
Don't do it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Okay then!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, wait. Is there anything in here cats can't eat?   
Hmm... Well, if it's just flavored rice, it should be okay.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, right. There might be things in here cats can't eat.   
Happy - But then again, if it's just flavored rice, I think it'll be okay.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Here you go, kitty.   
   
Stray Cat   
Meow.   
   
Stray Cat   
Meow!!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Huh...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Wh-What happened?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh no, not again...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - ......   
It does have some bitterness, I guess.   
I thought I struck a good nutritional balance, though.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - But I know nutrition's not the issue here.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Sorry, Arisato-kun. I can't let you eat this.   
Sad - I don't want to put you in the hospital...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I can handle a bit.   
Maybe we can use it in battle.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - N-No!   
Surprised - I'll figure out what to do with this later, b-but you can't eat it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You mean like, feed it to the Shadows?   
But... do Shadows even eat food?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - ...I'm so hopeless.   
Sad - I just wanted to do something to help everyone outside of battle.   
Sad - There aren't many chances to eat homemade food when you live in the dorm.   
Sad - So I thought it would be nice to cook for everyone, but...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I'm sorry. I'll keep trying to get better though.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I can tell Fuuka is being considerate of me.   
It seems we've grown closer...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - It's kind of hard for me to say this, considering what just happened, but...   
I hope you'll be willing to taste test my cooking again.   
I don't think I can do this alone. Can I... count on you to help?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure thing.   
Will it be good next time?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh, that's great! Thank you, Arisato-kun.   
Happy - I'm going to keep working at it. Then someday, you'll tell me you like my cooking.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - W-Well, um...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm going to try really hard! And hopefully I don't make you sick in the process.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, I didn't realize it was so late.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I need to buy more ingredients, so I should get going. I'll see you later.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I said goodbye to Fuuka and   
went back to the dorm...

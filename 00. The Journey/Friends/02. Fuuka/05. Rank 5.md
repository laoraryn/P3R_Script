...So, there's actually something I want you to try, Arisato-kun.   
And this time it isn't just for a taste test.   
I think you'll actually be able to eat it!   
...Wait, uh, maybe I said the same thing last time...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Well, now I mean it!

Fuuka presents me with a bento box.   
There are rice balls wrapped   
in seaweed inside.   
They smell good. I decide to try one...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It's edible, at least.   
The rice tastes good, and it has   
just the right amount of seasoning.   
In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's delicious.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - W-Well... How is it?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's good.   
You did a great job.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Really? Oh, I'm so glad.   
Happy - Hehe, I finally got you to say it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Really? I'm so glad to hear that.   
Happy - Thank you.

You know how I said I was having trouble with cooking?   
Well, I decided to try and find a recipe that even I couldn't mess up.   
And after a lot of consideration... I thought maybe making rice balls is something I could handle.   
Happy - But then I got really absorbed in how simple they are to make, yet still so hard to master.

I made some rice balls today in home economics class too.   
I know it's a little silly to make something so basic in high school, but it was all I could manage.   
But then, everyone in the class told me they were really good, though!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Anyways, I've been really looking forward to have you try one, Arisato-kun.   
I wanted you to see how much progress I've made.   
Because, I don't think I could have made it this far without you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'm glad I could help.   
I didn't do anything.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
...Thanks.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
But you did though. You taught me so much.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I know I've said this before, but...   
When I'm with you and the rest of the team, I'm able to see things more positively.   
And I think the most important thing is the feeling of wanting to make others happy.   
That might be the reason why I made such good rice balls. Because I was thinking about who was going to eat them.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Thank you.   
I think I get it.   
Can you make more sometime?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I'm the one that should be thanking you.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - They say, "Love is the most flavorful spice," and it turns out it was true.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Of course! Just let me know anytime you want some.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um, Arisato-kun, I just wanted to say...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Thank you so much. Really.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Fuuka seems to really appreciate me.   
Our relationship is getting deeper...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - So it turns out, there's actually a trick to making good rice balls.   
Happy - The first thing to note is while you're washing the rice...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I spend the day listening to   
Fuuka's tips on making rice balls.   
I decided to go back to the dorm...

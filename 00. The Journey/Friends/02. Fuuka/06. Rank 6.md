Fuuka Yamagishi   
...I decided I want to be able to make more than just rice balls.   
I started learning how to cook because I wanted to thank everyone for what they've done for me.   
But only knowing how to make rice balls isn't going to cut it.   
I told myself I needed to do something more, but then I started to doubt myself again.   
That's when I thought of you, Arisato-kun.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
So what I'm saying is, um... I'd like you to help me for just a bit longer.   
And I'd really appreciate it if you could keep giving me your advice.   
I promise I'm going to do the best I can. So can I count on you?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Of course.   
You sure you're not overdoing it?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Really?   
Happy - Oh, I'm so happy to hear that. Thank you!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Huh?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I-I didn't think I was...   
Sad - ......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I just want to thank everyone for helping me find my place in the world.   
I know I don't seem very reliable, but I want to make myself a useful member of the team.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's the spirit.   
Don't get too carried away.   
You're already plenty useful.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Thank you!   
Happy - It feels so reassuring to have your support, Arisato-kun.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
...Thanks for looking out for me.   
But don't worry, I'll be fine.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Personally, I don't think so.   
But thank you. You're always so encouraging.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
More than anything though...   
I want to keep learning, for your sake too, Arisato-kun.   
I'd like to be able to help you with more than just fighting.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I can sense Fuuka's powerful resolve.   
It seems we've grown closer...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um, I was wondering...   
You don't think I'm... I'm overdoing it, right?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
...Sorry, I guess I'm the only one who can answer that.   
......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm going to head back now.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I parted with Fuuka and returned   
to the dorm separately...

Junpei Iori   
Happy - 'Sup, Minato?   
...Hey, you have some time now? I'll treat you to some takoyaki.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend some time with Junpei?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Spend time with Junpei   
Not now   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Alright! Let's head to Octopia.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh... Caught you at a bad time, huh?   
Happy - Well, lemme know next time you have time to hang out.   
   
-----   
   
Junpei Iori   
You go on ahead to the shrine. I'll grab us some takoyaki.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sounds good.   
Want me to wait for you?   
Why the shrine?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Sweet, be right there!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Aw, you gonna miss me?   
Happy - It's fine, just go on ahead. I'll be there in a sec.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I wanna get away from the hustle and bustle of the city and enjoy some takoyaki in peace.   
Anywho, I'll catch up in a sec.   
   
---   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Got some takoyaki. This one's for you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Thanks!   
Oddly generous of you...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Sure thing! Be sure to thank me for every single bite.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - C'mon, look at these eyes. Why would you ever suspect me like that?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Just messin' around. To be honest, this is kind of an apology for the other day.   
Y'know, back when I blew up at you?   
One pack of takoyaki ain't gonna make up for it, but it's better than nothin', right?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I already forgave you.   
This fixes nothing.   
Is this all you've got?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Heh, thanks.   
Happy - Still, I felt like words weren't enough for an apology.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - ...Yeah, I guess it doesn't.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Uh, you want my share, too?   
Ah, I don't blame you. I'd say the same thing.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I took my anger out on you, and you totally didn't deserve that.   
It's 'cause I really wanted to take out my anger on someone else.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Remember when I mentioned I was visiting someone at the hospital?   
And how I pissed her off, but I didn't know what I did wrong? I, uh... think I get it now.   
   
Junpei Iori   
A while back, I was asked what I'd be doing with my life in two years... by Chidori.   
Sad - And being the insensitive dumbass I am, I said something like, "Beats me."   
Sad - For a long time, I didn't even understand how it must've felt for her to ask me that.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - So it's no wonder she got upset.   
Sad - She was facin' somethin' really scary, and there I was actin' like it was no big deal.   
   
Junpei Iori   
The other day, when everyone was all calm and chattin' about what Ryoji said...   
It put everything into perspective.   
When it finally hit me, I lost my shit and snapped at you.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I'm really sorry about that, man.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - H-Hey, c'mon, eat up! Don't want cold takoyaki, do ya?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Whew, that was taaasty! And it's not too bad cold, either.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, by the way. Have you decided what you're gonna do on the 31st yet?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, I have.   
I'm still thinking about it.   
It's a secret.   
   
Junpei Iori   
...Gotcha.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I hear ya. It's a hell of a decision to make.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Guess that means you have some idea.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Look, Minato. Me and the others might tell you all kinds of stuff.   
But whatever we say, go with your own gut. You've dealt with enough as it is, y'know?   
   
Junpei Iori   
I've... always been jealous of you. You're a special dude, and everyone's always countin' on you.   
But at the same time, I knew you were the one making all the tough calls.   
You're always lookin' out for everyone around you, even people like me.   
Sure, I was jealous, but watchin' you... I knew I could never be you.   
   
Junpei Iori   
So I figured maybe it's time you chose what you wanted to do for a change.   
Besides, forgettin' everything doesn't exactly sound so bad, does it?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Do you really think that?   
What about Chidori?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - ......   
Sad - I mean, I obviously wouldn't like that. It'd suck to forget everything.   
   
Junpei Iori   
But, that's just how I feel.   
You should follow your feelings. Whatever you choose, I won't let anyone tell you otherwise.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Alright! That's enough serious stuff!   
Happy - Chats like this make my throat all dry. Or maybe it's just the takoyaki?   
Happy - Let's grab a drink somewhere and head back. That okay with you, Mr. Leader?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Junpei and I chatted all the way home.   
I feel like my  has improved   
after Junpei gave me words of support...

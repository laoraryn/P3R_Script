Junpei Iori   
Happy - Yo, Minato.   
...This might seem kinda sudden, but wanna do something active?   
Happy - Let's play some catch! I brought a glove for you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend some time with Junpei?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Spend time with Junpei   
Not now   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Really? Sick! Thanks, dude!   
Happy - Let's go to the park at the shrine. I'll show you my fastball!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - You got other plans already? That's alright, we can do this some other time.   
   
-----   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - The hell's this!? It says, "No playing catch in the park"...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Kinda messed up, don't ya think?   
Sad - Playing catch is how kids're supposed to make friends. Adults can't just ban it 'cause they feel like it!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It depends where, though.   
Yeah, they can't do that!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Oh. Yeah that'd be the logical response, but...   
I'm just sayin', if more places end up like this, it's gonna be a real problem for kids who wanna play baseball.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Right? I don't like this one bit!   
   
Junpei Iori   
In any case, I didn't know it was banned here 'til today.   
When I first moved here, I'd play against the wall every now and then.   
   
Junpei Iori   
This whole catch thing... It's 'cause I wanted to get my arms back in shape.   
I've been thinkin' about maybe gettin' back into baseball again.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I still have no clue what I wanna do with my life.   
And if I keep tryin' to avoid it, I'll have nothin' but regret hangin' over me.   
Next time I'm asked what I'll be doin' in two years, I wanna have a real answer.   
   
Junpei Iori   
That's why I'm pickin' baseball back up. You, uh, think that's the right call?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sounds like a great call.   
Do you think it's the right call?   
That's such a Junpei move.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oh yeah? Heh, well that makes me feel pretty good about it, then.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well... nothin' else really comes to mind.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Heh, that supposed to be a compliment?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Anyway, here. This is for you.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Today was a bust, but we'll try again another time. Hang on to that 'til then.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Though I guess we'll have to wait 'til after you-know-what, huh.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Ahh, I don't know... Honestly, I've been feelin' like this since April.   
Sad - I can barely juggle what I've got on my plate as it is, let alone think about the future.   
Our senpais, though... They're such badasses. They're still preppin' for exams even with everything goin' on.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Man, it's been a hell of a year.   
   
Junpei Iori   
We're gonna look back on all this someday and wonder how we ever got through any of it.   
It wasn't all good, and we hit more than a few rough patches...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Guess you could say our short lives have been pretty wild so far, eh?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You said it.   
I wouldn't say that.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Haha, right!?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Dude, you're s'posed to just nod and agree. Eh, but I guess that's how you see it.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Despite all that's happened, I'm glad you became our leader, Minato.   
I know I said you should do what you wanna do, but thanks for choosin' to fight.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Well, then...   
Happy - Let's make sure this chapter of our lives ends on a happy note, alright?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - And then Hollywood'll turn our adventure into a movie!   
Happy - I'd be the lead, obviously. Dude, you'd be a shoe-in for Best Supporting Actor!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Heheheh.   
Happy - That serious crap ain't our style, is it?   
Happy - C'mon, let's head home. We'll figure out how to sweep the Oscars on the way.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Junpei and I goofed off   
on the way home.

You have forged a powerful bond with Junpei! You can now fuse **Surt**, the lord of fire!

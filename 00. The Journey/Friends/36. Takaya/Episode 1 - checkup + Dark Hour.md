Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - Ah, good evening.   
I just came by to check in on Koromaru. Do you think he'll do well?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
He'll be fine.   
I'm not sure.   
It's too early to say.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - That's good to hear.   
Happy - Well, given his reputation for loyalty, I wasn't too worried in the first place.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Now, no need to be so hard on yourself. I'll provide what support I can from my end as well.   
Surprised - Oh wait, are you more of a cat person? Well, there's not much I can do in that situation...   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
I suppose that's fair.   
No need to rush, you'll have plenty of time to get to know each other.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
If you have any concerns, please feel free to let me know anytime.   
It's only fair, considering I was the one who requested that Koromaru join the squad.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oh, I'm all for Koromaru joining us, he's totally welcome!   
Happy - I'll even throw in training lessons from the master!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Um, I'm pretty sure Koro-chan's already more disciplined than you.   
Could you even sit still if someone told you to "stay"?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Hey, don't compare me to a dog!   
I'm totally disciplined! ...I can follow directions... Kinda...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Yeah, you really sold us on it.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Aaanyway... So, Mr. Chairman, uhh... about those summer classes...   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Ah, yes, I heard about Kirijo-kun's plan.   
It sounded like a good idea, so I went along with it.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - No! Why would you agree to that!?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Oh, was I being nosy?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - I'm missing out on my passionate summer romance... She's disappearing before my eyes...   
Sad - Farewell... my beautiful city girl... awaiting me... by the shoreline...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
The city or the shores? Pick one!   
Even if you didn't have classes, you'd probably just bum around the station all day.   
Angry - You should just accept your fate.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, by the way, Mr. Chairman...   
Weren't you about to tell us something before Arisato-kun arrived?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Hm...? Ah, that's right.   
Aside from my unnecessary meddling, I do have another request for all of you.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Does everyone have a moment?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
I think it's a good time for you all to get a routine health checkup.   
You know where Tatsumi Memorial Hospital is, right?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, that's where Sanada-senpai was treated before.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
With how much you've all been fighting lately, it'd be best to stay on top of your physical health.   
It wouldn't be good if your Personas were causing any strain on your bodies, right?   
I expect it shouldn't be too much of a detour to stop by the hospital after your summer classes.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I understand. Still, this is rather sudden.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - Don't worry too much about it. Like they say, "A stitch in time saves nine." Or, your side.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
We'll be doing the checkups individually, one day at a time.   
You can decide amongst yourselves who goes when.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - Don't forget to deck up for your checkup! Haha, just kidding.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - Oh, maybe bring your Evokers in case you need to take any shots?   
   
---   
   
   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Thanks for being so patient. That just about concludes your checkup.   
Sorry yours ended up taking so much longer than everyone else's.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's about time.   
That's all right.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Exasperated* - I'm sorry, really.   
Exasperated* - If I'd known how long it would take, I would've scheduled an entire day for it.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
I'm glad to hear you say that.   
Although, we could have done it another time and taken a full day for it.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Your Persona abilities are rather unusual compared to the others', aren't they?   
That's why we had to run so many more tests on you.   
Well, based on how you've performed so far, I don't expect there to be any problems...   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Persona abilities can be dangerous, depending on how they're used.   
With that in mind, it can't hurt to err on the side of caution.   
How are you feeling about it? Do you have any concerns about your power?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
None at all.   
You could say that.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - Good to hear.   
Happy - And I don't think there will be any issues with your test results either.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
That's understandable, but I don't think there will be any issues with your test results.   
And based on what I'm hearing from Kirijo-kun's reports, you've been performing just fine.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - I truly am grateful for everything the team has done.   
Happy - Especially you.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Things have really changed for the better since you arrived.   
Our team has grown, and we've even figured out how we can eliminate the Dark Hour.   
In a way, you've sort of gotten the clock ticking for us again.   
It's almost as if... we were just waiting for you these past ten years.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - I'm afraid I can only support you from behind the scenes, but...   
Happy - I'll be counting on you to eliminate the four remaining Shadows.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Now then, it's getting pretty late. Why don't we get you back to the dor—   
   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Oops, excuse me for a second...   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Hello?   
Oh! Thanks for your help the other day. Uh-huh... Yes... It's missing from that document?   
Surprised - It's urgent...? Wai— B-By today!?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Looks like he received an urgent call...   
I should head back to the dorm alone.   
   
---   
   
   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, Arisato-kun. It looks like you're at Iwatodai Station now.   
It's so late, we were starting to get worried...   
Um, did you run into any trouble?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
My check-up took a while.   
It was nothing.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh! I see. I hope everything's all right...   
I'll let Kirijo-senpai know. We're in the command room right now.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - O-Oh, I see... Well, as long as you're okay...   
Sad - It's already past curfew though, so that's a little bit of an issue...   
Sad - Actually, um, I'm with Kirijo-senpai right now in the command room.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'll go ahead and navigate you back to the dorm.   
I'm sure you'll be fine, but considering what happened with Koro-chan, I'd rather play it safe.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Thanks.   
You worry too much.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - ...!?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Wait... I can sense a Shadow!   
Surprised - And it's really close to you, Arisato-kun! It's over at the Moonlight Bridge!   
Sad - It's too dangerous to go alone. You should stay put until everyone else gets there...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh no...! There's another reading near the Shadow! It's a person!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'll buy some time.   
Call the others, quick.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Ah, wait— Arisato-kun!?   
   
---   
   
Takaya   
Oh my, and what have we here?   
   
Takaya   
So much power, so much chaos... I'd not be foolish enough to turn my back on such a predator.   
And on top of that, we have an unexpected guest tonight.   
Not a very favorable situation, all things considered.   
   
Takaya   
So, given this little predicament, how do you intend to partake?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'm here to help.   
Stand back.   
Let's see what you've got.   
   
Takaya   
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend," is it?   
Sound reasoning.   
   
Takaya   
Happy - Very well. Let's see what you're capable of.   
However, if you're not up to the task, I might just take you out with it.   
   
Takaya   
So long as you aren't against me, I will allow it.   
I don't know what our foe is capable of, but I trust you can protect yourself?   
   
---   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The defeated Shadow seems   
to have dropped something...   
   
Takaya   
......   
   
Takaya   
Your Persona ability is truly fascinating.   
It's different from the one I saw the last time, isn't it?   
So, you can choose from multiple Personas to fit the situation...   
You must be burdened with an extremely unusual fate.   
   
Takaya   
It seems your friend has arrived.   
Then I suppose I'll have to be on my way for tonight.   
   
Takaya   
What is your name?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Minato Arisato.   
......   
   
Takaya   
I'll see to it that I remember.   
   
Takaya   
Smart. Discretion is the better part of valor.   
   
Takaya   
Enemies though we may be, I'm not one for leaving a debt unsettled.   
I shall have to repay you another time.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Are you all right, Arisato?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Did you already defeat the Shadow?   
Good work, but that was an unnecessary risk you took.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I had help.   
The situation called for it.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You can fill me in on the way back.   
In any case, I'm glad you're okay.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I explained what happened on   
our way back to the dorm...

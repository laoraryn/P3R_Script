Elizabeth   
Phew...   
Flowing stairs that pose an obstacle to those who dare to reach another floor... So this is an "escalator."   
Sad - A simple contraption at first glance, but one false step will leave one mired in an exhausting ordeal...   
   
Announcement   
To all customers: For your own safety, and the safety of others, please do not move in the opposite direction of the escalators. Thank you.   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - Oh my...   
It seems that these "customers" may come to harm. We'd best exercise caution ourselves.   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - And what is this...!?   
Please watch your step! There is a pitfall just ahead.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
...Where is it?   
I don't see one.   
   
Elizabeth   
Why, it's right over here.   
   
Elizabeth   
There, in the center of this fenced-off area.   
It's marked with eye-catching signs, proclaiming in bold print, "Do Not Enter"!   
Sad - Humans are frequently drawn to what has been forbidden...   
   
Elizabeth   
This is a crafty snare, one that defies the common notion that pitfalls must be hidden.   
Flowing stairways, pitfalls employing high-level psychological tactics...   
Human authorities truly go to great lengths in their quest to preserve the town's law and order.   
   
Elizabeth   
I'm very moved by their dedication to the cause.   
Let us carry on, our thoughts with the unsung heroes who give their love and lives to this town...   
   
---   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - Oh...?   
Surprised - This tantalizing fragrance... Can it be...!?   
   
Octopia Cook   
Whoa, you can figure out our secret ingredient with just a whiff?   
I guess you got a funky sense of smell to go with your funky sense of style, lady.   
Well, there ain't a law sayin' takoyaki shops can't cook other stuff besides octopus.   
So how 'bout it? Wanna buy some? I swear, my takoyaki's so good it'll make your jaw drop!   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - Cuisine so scrumptious that one's jaw can drop off!?   
...I imagine that would warrant urgent medical care, realistically speaking, but I would very much like a taste.   
   
Elizabeth   
Sad - Unfortunately, this is all I have on me at the moment. I do hope this is sufficient.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's not that expensive...   
You're buying that many...?   
   
Elizabeth   
No need to console me. My curiosity far exceeds any monetary—   
   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - Oh, I see... Upon closer inspection, a single serving is only 400 yen.   
Surprised - ......   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - W-Well then! Two orders of your finest takoyaki, please.   
   
Elizabeth   
I have yet to see someone who has actually lost their jaw.   
Happy - That must mean that the ordinary citizen cannot easily afford these.   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - Oh...? Upon closer inspection, a single serving is only 400 yen.   
Surprised - ......   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - W-Well then! Two orders of your finest takoyaki, please.   
   
Octopia Cook   
Thanks! Here you go, and come again!   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - This distinct texture... The firm, chewy skin... There's no doubt about it.   
I must say, I'm surprised to see this used as a cooking ingredient.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
See what...?   
How's your jaw?   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - The human mind... It is cursed to forever retain whatever knowledge it gains, whether good or ill.   
Happy - Forgive my reticence, but some questions are better left unanswered.   
......   
   
Elizabeth   
It has yet to even unhinge...   
But for the better, I suppose. There are many other delicacies I must try.   
Happy - It wouldn't do to lose my jaw before sampling each and every one of them.   
   
Elizabeth   
There appear to be several dining establishments around here... We must simply visit all of them.   
My first priority is to go to something called a "net café" where one may use something called a "soda fountain."   
Happy - This apparatus allows for an infinite combination of flavors by mixing various solutions...   
Happy - Just thinking about it gives me a sort of electric tingle across my tongue.   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - Ahhh... I see.   
   
Elizabeth   
My, oh my...   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - Oh, how intriguing...   
   
Elizabeth   
We appear to have exhausted every dining option in this area.   
Sad - ...Oh dear, is something the matter?   
Sad - Now that I think about it, you haven't eaten much since our seventh meal...   
In any event, I must thank you for your delightful company. I shall certainly savor this experience.   
If you don't mind, I'd very much appreciate it if you were to escort me again sometime.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I returned to the Velvet Room with Elizabeth.

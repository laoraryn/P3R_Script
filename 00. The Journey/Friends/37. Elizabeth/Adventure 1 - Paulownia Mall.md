Elizabeth   
Surprised - Oh my! An encounter with one of your world's exquisite treasures, right out of the blue!   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - So this... is The Fountain.   
Surprised - It makes sport of water, a precious resource and the very foundation of life. Such a sinful form of art...   
   
Elizabeth   
Sad - I've heard of its mystical powers, wherein those who offer coin may have their wishes granted...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's a superstition.   
Maybe so...   
Calm down.   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - ...Oh? Is that so?   
   
Elizabeth   
Sad - Or perhaps the offerings were far too insufficient to have attracted the fountain spirit's interest?   
Fortunately, I anticipated this and brought a hefty sum of coins.   
   
Elizabeth   
2,000 of your 500-yen coins, to be exact.   
I shall make an opening bid of one million yen.   
   
Elizabeth   
Then I must try my hand at this.

Elizabeth   
Oh, forgive me. My enthusiasm simply couldn't be contained. I even brought some coin for the occasion.

Elizabeth   
Surprised - Oh!   
   
Elizabeth   
Sad - I was so caught up in the excitement that I started tossing coins without giving my wish any thought.   
Sad - This won't do...   
   
Elizabeth   
I shall give it more careful consideration before I return here in the near future...   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - Hm? What is this facility here?   
Surprised - I see there's a gentleman inside with quite the stern face...   
   
Elizabeth   
And these photographs displayed so prominently...   
"Most Wanted"... "Reward"...   
Hm... Would it be correct to presume that these are your version of my subjugation requests?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Pretty much.   
You don't kill them...   
I'm not sure.   
   
Elizabeth   
What do they use as proof that the target has been subjugated?   
If they truly parallel my requests... then do they require a piece of the body?   
Happy - My interest has been piqued...   
   
Elizabeth   
I see... So the target must be captured alive.   
Happy - I shall keep that in mind.   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - It must be a truly mysterious process, if the particulars elude even you.   
Surprised - If they do indeed parallel my requests, I wonder how they confirm whether or not a mission has been completed.   
Happy - Perhaps they too require a piece of the body? My interest is piqued...   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - This edifice over here...   
Surprised - Is this what you call... a "club"!?   
Happy - Dancers, dictated by the sway of one's inner passions... A subterranean garden, flourishing with uninhibited desires...   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - ...!?   
Sad - Oh no... It's closed right now!?   
Sad - Oh, what a pity... I had hoped to become part of the "scene."   
   
Elizabeth   
Woooooo.   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - Well, that was quite satisfying.   
But I'm overwhelmed... Everything looks so new and inviting. Everywhere I look, something catches the eye.   
...If you don't mind, could you perhaps recommend our next activity?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's go do karaoke.   
Let's go to the arcade.   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - "Karaoke"? Could it be...?   
It appears the time has come to demonstrate my hidden talents...   
One may even challenge professional singers at the touch of a button at this "karaoke"!   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - This "arcade"... I have heard of it before.   
If I am not mistaken, it is a playground where one sports with electronic fairies in exchange for tokens...   
They may also have games where one controls a crane's claw to win prizes... I'm eager to see it in action.   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - Ah, excuse me... Would you mind waiting for a moment?   
...I hadn't noticed there was a fountain on this side as well.   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - ...!?   
Surprised - Yet another fountain, on the opposite side...   
I see... So this place plays host to a trinity of fountain spirits.   
   
Elizabeth   
...I apologize for the wait. Let us continue.   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - This mechanism...   
Am I correct to assume that I ought to punch this area with all my strength?   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - Now then... I shall perform a song of exaltation for my master. Sing along if you will... La~Lala~♪   
   
Surprised - ...Oh my. You've never heard this song before?   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - Thank you for the invaluable experiences you've shared with me today.   
I consider this mission a complete success.   
This may sound forward, but... I'd like for you to accompany me again sometime.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I returned to the Velvet Room with Elizabeth.

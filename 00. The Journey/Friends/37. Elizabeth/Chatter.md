Elizabeth   
In the wake of your recent expedition, I bear news which may be of interest to you.   
It seems that at this moment, your bonds will have a uniquely beneficial effect on the creation of new Personas.   
If you wish to take advantage of this opportunity, please visit the Velvet Room.   
   
------   
   
Elizabeth   
Your power has grown, it seems. Theurgy, was it...? An impressive feat.   
On the topic of such power, I must ask—are you familiar with the Major Arcana?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I am.   
The what?   
   
Elizabeth   
To utilize metaphor, the Major Arcana are the parent plants which will help propagate your ever-growing garden of abilities.   
After defeating particularly strong Shadows, these Major Arcana will appear to you as cards.   
It would be in your best interest to collect these cards as you find them.   
   
Elizabeth   
That aside... It seems that when you change, Tartarus changes as well.   
A number of strange doors have appeared within Tartarus.   
Where these doors lead, whether this bodes ill or well...   
Even I do not have that knowledge.   
However, I believe you have the wherewithal to find out. Take the leap. You may discover something useful.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I can do that.   
I'd rather not...   
Why?   
   
Elizabeth   
Excellent. I have faith in you.   
   
Elizabeth   
Come now, there's little room for modesty in matters such as these.   
   
Elizabeth   
Those who challenge the unknown, choosing risk over comfort, often achieve greatness.   
I believe such challenges necessarily facilitate some form of growth.   
Your courage will lead to your betterment, Minato. I sincerely hope you will continue to act on it.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Something weird's going on in Tartarus...   
These doors... Should I go investigate?   
   
Elizabeth   
I must congratulate you on your recent victory. Your power continues to grow, it seems.   
On the topic of such power, I must ask—are you familiar with the Major Arcana?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I am.   
The what?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The Major Arcana...   
That'll be a useful resource going forward...   
   
Elizabeth   
While awaiting your arrival, I sensed something shifting within Tartarus.   
A number of strange doors have appeared there, it seems.   
Where these doors lead, whether this bodes ill or well...   
Even I do not have that knowledge.   
However, I believe you have the wherewithal to find out. Take the leap. You may discover something useful.   
   
------   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Fuuka and the others are talking   
about that door from earlier.   
   
Elizabeth   
Minato, may I borrow you for a moment?   
   
Elizabeth   
It would appear you've faced the threat beyond that door.   
A door connecting to the tunnel which was created within Tartarus... Perhaps an appropriate name for it would be a "**Monad door**."   
The Shadows that congregate past such doors will prove to be a valuable means of accelerating your growth.   
I must know how you fared. Did your enemies provide you with a challenge?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It was a rough fight.   
They went down easy.   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - Excellent. I am pleased to hear that.   
Happy - I believe challenging more daunting foes will act as a sort of shortcut in your development.   
   
Elizabeth   
On another note...   
I've detected some sort of structure on the 91st floor. It emanates an energy not dissimilar to the door you entered.   
The dimensions of this structure resemble a tunnel. One might call it a "**Monad Passage**."   
Entering this passage may provide you with another opportunity to test your mettle.   
For the time being, I will log that investigation as a personal request.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I've received a new request from Elizabeth.   
   
Elizabeth   
I look forward to observing your continual progress.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
A **Monad door**... And a passage, too?   
Tartarus is never gonna stop   
being a mystery to me...   
   
------   
   
Elizabeth   
I'd like to bestow on you a reward for overcoming great hardship time after time.   
Please accept this gift.   
   
-----   
   
Elizabeth   
Oh? You appear to be harboring a new potential.   
The Personas you've acquired are resonating with one another, elevating you to greater heights.   
   
Elizabeth   
Oh my... You appear to have gained a new power.   
I believe you called it "Theurgy"?   
Now that you've become even stronger...   
You should be able to battle more efficiently and exquisitely with your multiple Personas.   
As you acquire more Personas to fill the Compendium, you'll open your mind to new battle stratagems.   
For the time being... you do seem to wield your new power quite effectively.   
   
------   
   
Elizabeth   
The number of acquired Personas is steadily increasing.   
A Persona represents one's heart and soul. Its strength reflects the effort we put in to better ourselves every day.   
It is a great pleasure to be witness to your incredible growth.   
   
Elizabeth   
The number of acquired Personas seems to have increased significantly.   
I am immensely pleased to witness you further your growth.   
   
-------   
   
Elizabeth   
Oh? Is there something I can assist you with?   
   
Elizabeth   
Did you need anything else?   
   
Elizabeth   
How may I assist you?   
   
Elizabeth   
Thank you for earlier. Now then... How may I be of assistance?   
   
Elizabeth   
If you require anything else, please do not hesitate to ask.

My...   
Happy - I've been waiting for you to ask. Shall we be on our way?   
   
Elizabeth   
Sad - I'm terribly sorry, but... I would much rather you extend an invitation during the day.   
   
Elizabeth   
Sad - I'm terribly sorry... but I'm afraid it will have to wait for another day.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
She turned down my invitation...   
I should just focus on   
other requests for now.   
   
Elizabeth   
I'm taking our next destination into great consideration. Please wait awhile until I've made up my mind.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Elizabeth is figuring out where to go next...   
Maybe if I fulfill more of her requests,   
I'll be able to invite her out...   
   
Elizabeth   
From what I've gathered, I believe your school is having a "holiday," correct?   
I wish to experience the average student's daily routine... Could you invite me on a regular school day?   
   
Elizabeth   
Sad - ......   
Sad - I... can't do that.   
Sad - As I've told you...   
Sad - It is my utmost priority to fulfill my duty.   
   
Elizabeth   
A moment if you will? There is something I must inform you of.   
Whenever you complete one of my many requests, I become ever curiouser about this world...   
And now an urge to investigate this place for myself has arisen within me.   
Therefore, I would like to request that you escort me to various locations.   
First, I would like you to guide me through the Paulownia Mall here.   
If you have the time, then please come fetch me so long as the sun is out.   
   
Elizabeth   
I've been waiting for you.   
Regarding my request to have you escort me to various locations in this world...   
I would like you to show me around this Paulownia Mall first.   
If you have the time, then please come fetch me so long as the sun is out.   
   
Elizabeth   
A moment if you will? There is something I must inform you of.   
Thus far, you have completed a number of my requests...   
And, just as I had thought, this world truly is interesting... So much so that an urge to investigate it myself has risen within me.   
Therefore, I would like to request that you escort me to various locations.   
Please come to Paulownia Mall at a later date. I will give you more details then.   
   
Elizabeth   
May I have a moment of your time?   
I humbly request that you escort me somewhere once again.   
This time, I would like to investigate a certain area known as Iwatodai.   
If you have the time, then please come fetch me so long as the sun is out.   
   
Elizabeth   
May I have a moment of your time?   
Do you mind... escorting me yet again?   
This time, I would like to go to a location known as Naganaki Shrine.   
If you have the time, then please come fetch me so long as the sun is out.   
   
Elizabeth   
May I have a moment of your time?   
I apologize if this is becoming repetitive, but... I'd like to ask you to escort me once more.   
This time, could you take me to this Gekkoukan High School you attend?   
If you have the time after school, please come by and let me know.   
   
Elizabeth   
May I have a moment of your time?   
Sad - There is yet another location I would like to visit...   
Sad - Would it be all right if, um... well, if you could invite me to your room?   
...I'll be waiting for you here.   
   
Elizabeth   
It's as if your presence emanates a far brighter radiance than before. Perhaps all your hard work is starting to show.   
Here. It may not be much, but this is my gift to you. Please accept it.   
   
Elizabeth   
I can sense that the power growing within you stems from the bonds you have forged and nurtured.   
Here. It may not be much, but this is my gift to you. Please accept it.   
   
Elizabeth   
I can see that you are living quite the fulfilling life, between nurturing your bonds and striving for self-improvement.   
This is less of a reward and more of a gift from me to you. Please, take it.   
   
Elizabeth   
I still cannot foresee the limits of your potential... I look forward to witnessing you grow even further.   
   
Elizabeth   
...I sense someone.   
There seems to be a human presence within Tartarus between floors  and .   
It would be best for you to search the tower and locate them as soon as possible.   
   
Elizabeth   
I see that you have rescued those who were trapped inside Tartarus.   
You may now rest easy... I no longer sense anyone within that tower.   
   
Elizabeth   
...It seems a little guest was feline curious and mew-andered their way to floor .   
Do keep that in mind as you explore.   
   
Elizabeth   
I don't sense any lost persons within Tartarus at this moment...   
However... it appears a little guest was feline curious enough to mew-ander inside.   
They should be somewhere around floor . Perhaps you should go find them.   
   
Elizabeth   
At long last... you will soon arrive at the top of this tower to overcome its challenges.   
I will do everything in my power to assist you up to the very end so that you may grasp victory.   
Please come see me if you feel your strength waning. I shall heal you.   
   
Elizabeth   
Very well.   
   
SYS_LAST_DAY_HEAL   
Everyone's HP and SP recovered!   
   
Elizabeth   
I see you are here to challenge Tartarus. Make sure you prepare appropriately...   
Should you have any business related to Personas, please visit the Velvet Room.   
   
Elizabeth   
If you have any business related to Personas, please visit the Velvet Room.   
However, you may speak with me about my personal requests here.   
   
Elizabeth   
I will add new requests periodically. You can expect new ones about once a month.   
Some, however, may only become available upon completion of other requests.   
Also, do pay attention to the "number" of the request.   
If there is a number missing, then there may be a request that is still hidden.   
   
Elizabeth   
As my master has said, deepening your bonds will bolster the strength of your Personas.   
I hope you enjoy a fulfilling life, one where you forge many meaningful relationships.   
   
Elizabeth   
The time has finally come.   
If you are in need of assistance, please let me know... for I intend to aid you to the very end.   
   
Elizabeth   
Oh my...   
Hehe... That is quite impressive.   
   
Elizabeth   
My, my... I see you have acquired a **Jack Frost**.   
This adorable, round figure, this mischievous countenance that makes it impossible to discern his thoughts...   
He is true perfection.   
Oh, and when paired with **Jack-o'-Lantern**, they put on quite a hysterical performance. Why, it may just knock you off your feet.   
If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend you do so.   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - My, my...   
Surprised - Your **Jack Frost**... has reached level 99.   
Surprised - I can't believe my eyes... To think you could even make this happen.   
Happy - You must have undergone incredible hardship to have him obtain such astounding power...   
Oh, how magnificent... Please, allow me to give you my sincerest praise.   
On top of his adorableness, he now has unparalleled strength.   
He has truly become an unstoppable force.   
...Weak to fire, you say? Well, that only makes him even more charming.   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - Hm, that Persona of yours... Orpheus.   
A being that was birthed only after forging a number of powerful bonds...   
I sense unfathomable strength and unrivaled potential dwelling within.   
I can hardly contain myself at the prospect of further growth...   
   
Elizabeth   
Not Used   
   
   
Elizabeth   
I wonder. When will the wish I made at the fountain be granted?   
Sad - I have yet to receive any confirmation or even a progress report...   
Sad - ...Perhaps I should have tossed in more coins.   
I suppose I'll double the amount to 2,000,000 yen next time.   
   
Elizabeth   
I thank you for allowing me to try so many delicacies the other day.   
Happy - They were all so very delectable, especially that takoyaki... It has become a new favorite of mine, one that can rival kinako.   
Angry - My interest in culinary delights has been piqued since then. However, my current position poses a bit of an obstacle.   
After much consideration, I have decided to increase the number of food-related requests.   
I am very much looking forward to seeing them fulfilled.   
   
Elizabeth   
I attempted to negotiate terms for incorporating playground equipment in the Velvet Room...   
Sad - Unfortunately, my proposition was denied. How disappointing...   
Angry - If I cannot obtain permission, then all that remains is to exploit my master's absence.   
Victory shall be mine... Please await the good news.   
   
Elizabeth   
Oh, yes... I've heard that this "high school" of yours holds festivals from time to time.   
This particular "culture festival" seems to be a very exciting occasion.   
Moreover, I hear that it could trigger distortions in the space-time continuum, transporting you back to the "teenage years."   
Unfortunately, I was unable to observe this phenomenon during my visit...   
Happy - But if the opportunity arises, I would very much like to partake in this festival with you one day.

Thank you... For the other day, that is.   
Sad - About what happened in your room...   
Surprised - ......   
Surprised - A-Ahem... Pardon me, but the memory is still... ah, quite vivid.   
I'd greatly appreciate it if you could keep what happened a secret... Especially from my master.   
   
Elizabeth   
Oh? Your aura seems very different from usual... Did something happen?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I went to the beach.   
It's a secret.   
   
Elizabeth   
Ah... The beach.   
Perhaps I am picking up the ocean's scent lingering on you.   
   
Elizabeth   
Oh, how disappointing. I don't mean to pry, but...   
Did you have what they call a "once in a lifetime experience"? I hear they tend to occur during summertime.   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - Regardless, I'm glad you were able to enjoy yourself.   
   
Elizabeth   
I noticed that you were absent for some time. Did you take a trip somewhere?   
Ah, a school trip... Where one embarks on a journey to better refine your body and soul.   
Then you must have overcome the final examination. You were once a student, but now you have become the master.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It was just a trip.   
That's not really a thing.   
   
Elizabeth   
Oh, is that so? My apologies.   
Happy - Regardless, all that matters is that it was a good experience for you.   
Surprised - ...Hm? Is something the matter? You look rather morose.   
   
Elizabeth   
Oh my... It looks as though you've forged a new bond, one that is far stronger and different from the others.   
......   
Sad - And the bond you share will deepen even further, entwining their fate with yours...   
Sad - I must admit, I'm a little envious.   
Sad - ......   
Oh, my apologies. Please, hold on tightly to that bond... That very precious, very special bond.

What's the matter?   
You look a little down.   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - My apologies.   
Sad - Ever since that bout with you, it seems I've been getting lost in my own thoughts more often...   
But you needn't worry about it.   
I believe... it is something that I will be able to overcome.   
   
Elizabeth   
The time has finally come.   
Happy - ......   
It seems you have a special strength that allows you to overcome any obstacle that stands in your way...   
Though your story may end in tragedy...   
I can say, with confidence, you will persevere for the best possible outcome.   
...May the goddess of fortune smile upon you.   
   
Elizabeth   
I truly believe that there is no hardship you cannot conquer.   
...May the goddess of fortune smile upon you.   
   
Elizabeth   
Hm... It appears you have grown spectacularly.   
I believe you will now be able to wield a veritable plethora of Personas.   
But in regard to your potential, this is only the beginning of what you can achieve...   
Happy - Hone your Personas, and reach for even greater heights...   
   
Elizabeth   
My... It appears you have undergone significant growth.   
One could say this is the culmination of your ability to attract others.   
Perhaps you may now be able to forge bonds with anyone with ease.   
   
Elizabeth   
...And with that, all requests have been marked completed.   
Which means you will not receive any more requests from me.   
Happy - To think this day would come... It's quite moving, really.   
I know I may have had some rather unreasonable requests, but you've performed so splendidly.   
Allow me to give you my formal thanks.   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - Oh, is that perhaps...?   
May I take a look at that brooch you have there?   
   
Elizabeth - MND_ELIZ_UNIQUE_TALK_18_   
I gave my  to Elizabeth.   
   
Elizabeth   
What intricate craftsmanship... And with platinum, no less!   
To tell you the truth, I absolutely adore things made of platinum...   
How exquisite... I had no idea such masterful creations are purchasable in your world.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You want it?   
I'd like you to have it.   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - Oh, may I?   
...Thank you.   
Though this is not exactly a request, allow me to bestow upon you a reward nonetheless.   
   
Elizabeth   
I will treasure this, always.   
   
Elizabeth   
Oh my, what do you have there? It looks like a doll of sorts.   
   
Elizabeth - MND_ELIZ_UNIQUE_TALK_19_   
I showed the  to Elizabeth.   
   
Elizabeth   
So... this is called the "Goggle-Eyed Idol"?   
It appears to be quite old... And I see the craftsman put a great amount of effort into the details.   
Surprised - Come to think of it... does it not remind you of a certain Persona?   
Happy - Hm... Perhaps that's why it caught my attention in the first place.   
Thank you for letting me study it. You may have this back now.   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - For some inexplicable reason... I have a sudden urge to, as you humans say, "accessorize."   
Perhaps this is the perfect opportunity to don those items you have brought me...

Minato Arisato - Selection   
Lookin' cool.   
Make it part of your look.   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - Why, thank you. I look quite stunning, if I do say so myself.   
Nothing raises the spirits more than adorning oneself with a little embellishment.   
Ah, but I mustn't get too carried away and forget my duties. That's enough distraction for today.   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - Why, mew-ci beaucoup— Ahem... I mean to say, thank you.   
Wearing these really does make you feel as if you are slowly transforming into a cat.   
But that's enough of that for now. I wouldn't really want to become a cat, after all.   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - Thank you— Achoo!   
...My apologies. I'm still getting used to how itchy this mustache is, you see.   
But that has certainly satisfied my urge, so that's enough dress-up for today.   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - Why, thank you.   
Wearing this hat has put me in a rather festive mood. The impulse to pass out presents is strong...   
Unfortunately, I have nothing to give at the moment. Perhaps another time.   
   
Elizabeth   
Sad - I don't deny that such urges do arise within me from time to time...   
Sad - However, my duty is to serve my master. I do not wish to cause trouble for him.   
Therefore... I believe that is enough distraction for today.   
   
Elizabeth   
Sad - Perhaps if my situation allowed it, I would have loved to do so.   
Sad - Alas, wearing this enables me to metamorphose into a cat in both mind and body...   
In order to fulfill my duties, I must refrain from wearing this on a regular basis...   
   
Elizabeth   
Angry - I don't deny that such urges do arise within me from time to time...   
Sad - However, wearing these causes my nose to itch quite a bit...   
I fear it would interfere with my duties. I will have to save it for a special occasion.   
   
Elizabeth   
Perhaps if my situation allowed it, I would have loved to do so.   
Sad - However, wearing this makes it difficult for me to suppress the impulse of giving out presents...   
But, in order to fulfill my duties, I will wear this whenever you desire.   
   
Elizabeth   
Thank you for indulging me.   
   
Elizabeth   
Were you able to gather beverages sold in the vending machines?   
I see... Of the different drinks available, you've managed to gather . Would you be able to collect  more?   
   
Elizabeth   
It appears you've gathered all the different drinks. May I collect them from you now?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Hand over the drinks   
No   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - I see. How disappointing. Perhaps some other time then.   
   
Elizabeth   
Oh my... There are this many!? It'd be such a waste to simply drink them.   
Perhaps tonight I will hold the ritual known as the "after-work drink" performed by laborers...   
In any case, the request is now completed. Please take this as your reward.   
   
Elizabeth   
I sense an unusual power emanating from you. Do you perhaps have one of the potatoes you have grown?

Elizabeth   
What a truly bizarre potato... I can sense an unusual power radiating from it.   
I imagine it would make a rather a-peeling meal.   
Surprised - ...Hm? Why are you giving me such a strange look?   
In any case, the request is now completed. Please take this as your reward.   
   
Elizabeth   
I see. How disappointing. Perhaps some other time then.

Elizabeth   
Surprised - Oh? I believe this is the first time I've ever had this, yet this flavor tastes rather... nostalgic.   
...I see. So this is what a "home-cooked meal" is.   
   
Elizabeth   
Though simple and rustic in presentation, you can tell it was made with care.   
This thoughtfulness must be an important element in what makes a dish truly "home-cooked"...   
   
Elizabeth   
The concept of "home" itself evokes a feeling of warmth and comfort—allegedly.   
Though this coffee has a bitter taste, its warmth exudes a sort of comforting feeling as well.   
Happy - In other words, something that's been "home-cooked" can be... soothing to the soul.

Ah, so this is what "home cooking" tastes like...   
An elegant, rich flavor. One with a luxurious mouthfeel.

Surprised - Oh my! A presentation that showcases both the charm and appeal of the dish...   
Surprised - An innovative combination of flavor profiles that deceives one's mind into savoring this taste for all eternity...   
Happy - Oh, how divine, absolutely divine! I never would have thought food could stir one's emotions...

I believe I now understand why people crave the taste of home cooking...   
Thank you very much for sharing this culinary delight. Please take this as your reward.

I see. How disappointing. Perhaps some other time then.

Oh? Is something the matter?   
Ah, I see... So there are people in your world who seek these materials.   
This  you seek can be found in the second block of Tartarus, Arqa.   
I've heard the **Lustful Snakes** that appear in the latter half of the block are quite fond of collecting them.   
A material that captivates both Shadows and humans... How remarkably peculiar.

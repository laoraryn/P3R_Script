Elizabeth   
So... this is your current domicile, the student dormitory?   
......   
   
---   
   
Elizabeth   
Surprised - So this is your room... I've never seen many of these items before.   
......   
   
Elizabeth   
If I might be permitted to ask... when I made the request to visit your room...   
Sad - Did it... make you a little suspicious?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, a little.   
Not really.   
   
Elizabeth   
Sad - In truth... there is something I wanted to tell you.   
   
Elizabeth   
Sad - I see...   
In truth, there is something I wanted to tell you...   
   
Elizabeth   
During my forays into your world, I encountered a great many things.   
Every single one of our outings is a treasured memory... Each one a polished, glittering gem.   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - Walking around the crowded Port Island streets... Sampling the local cuisine...   
Happy - Idling the hours away at the shrine... Even visiting your school for a day...   
And... I came to a realization.   
   
Elizabeth   
I had been subconsciously requesting to visit locations that were... more and more central to your life.   
And today, I endeavored to visit the one place in your world where I could learn the most about you...   
That is the reason as to why I requested to visit your room.   
   
Elizabeth   
If I may be so bold...   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - Do you recall the day you gave me a tour of your school?   
Happy - There was a moment where I mentioned that I "felt very fulfilled" when I touched you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I remember.   
Doesn't ring a bell.   
   
Elizabeth   
It was the first time I'd ever felt that way.   
   
Elizabeth   
Sad - ......   
It was the first time I'd ever felt that way.   
   
Elizabeth   
Sad - I thought to myself, why did I feel so fulfilled?   
But after coming all the way here, I finally found my answer.   
   
Elizabeth   
I believe it's because I had the chance to walk in your shoes.   
Happy - Those of us who reside in the Velvet Room wait with great anticipation for our "guests"...   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - Their arrival is our only link to the outside world, and gives us a reason for being.   
When I'm together with you... I can have that all for myself.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I think I get it.   
I don't really get it.   
   
Elizabeth   
Let me put it more plainly.   
I'm rather naive to the ways of your world, and there must have been many times when I behaved quite strangely...   
Happy - However... even I understand the significance of inviting a gentleman into his own room.   
   
Elizabeth   
Sad - If you wouldn't mind...   
Sad - I'd love for you... to guide me through it.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Boldly accept   
Gently decline   
   
Elizabeth   
Thank you...   
   
-   
   
Elizabeth   
Sad - ......   
I understand.   
I will refrain from asking any further.   
   
-   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
......   
I spent some time alone with Elizabeth.   
   
---   
   
Elizabeth   
I feel as if I've become an entirely different person compared to when I first set foot in your world.   
......   
   
Elizabeth   
Sad - If I stay on this side any longer, I fear I will forget my duties entirely...   
Sad - But I understand that wouldn't be ideal for you.   
   
Elizabeth   
That is why... I am drawing the line—no more visits here. I shall remain on my side.   
   
Elizabeth   
...Thank you very much for acting as a guide on my journey of discovery.   
Happy - I am truly grateful...   
   
Elizabeth   
Now then, though the sorrow may be sweet... let us part.

I returned to the Velvet Room with Elizabeth.

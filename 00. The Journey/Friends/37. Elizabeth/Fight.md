Elizabeth   
I've been waiting for you.   
   
Elizabeth   
The adversary I'd like you to defeat is currently standing before you.   
Yes, to put it simply, I am referring to myself.   
   
Elizabeth   
I have always longed to understand who I am...   
My master understands this desire of mine—as do you, I'm sure.   
Those who set foot in the Velvet Room are all destined to embark on a journey of self-discovery.   
Happy - Perhaps you could guide me to the answer I seek.   
   
Elizabeth   
Would you do me the honor of engaging me in battle?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yes.   
Hold on a bit.   
   
Elizabeth   
You have my thanks.   
Now, shall we dance?   
   
Elizabeth   
Then I shall wait here until you are ready.

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Who is that...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Uh... Is it just me, or does it seem like she wants to fight...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - What!? Her power readings... They're off the charts! ...Who IS she!?   
   
Elizabeth   
I make my living as an elevator attendant, but...   
   
Elizabeth   
I know several effective ways to inflict pain.   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - Don't worry, I'm not as fragile as I look. Try to kill me... if you can.   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - Magnificent! Your power is every bit as impressive as I'd hoped...   
   
Elizabeth   
But, the curtain has just risen... Show me your best performance!   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - Marvelous... You wield such power.   
   
Elizabeth   
The performance is underway. I shall give you something to remember!   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - And now, I give you the grand finale!

Elizabeth   
Thank you for a wonderful time.   
Now, please make your way to the entrance.   
I have some thinking to do.   
I shall see you again in the Velvet Room.   
   
Elizabeth - MND_000   
   
Elizabeth - MND_001   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yes   
No   
   
------   
Elizabeth   
I...   
   
Elizabeth   
I believed I could find my answer by challenging someone stronger than me...   
Alas, I was mistaken.   
I have received no such revelation as to who I am, not even in defeat.   
   
Elizabeth   
No... Perhaps I was too hasty. Perhaps I've already found my answer.   
Only I can understand who I am.   
And only I can decide who I am.   
   
Elizabeth   
Now, I believe congratulations are in order...   
You have overcome the most difficult obstacle I've placed in your path.   
You shall receive your reward in the same manner as always.   
And... please accept this as well.   
It is no reward, but a token of my gratitude.   
   
Elizabeth   
Happy - Well then, good day...

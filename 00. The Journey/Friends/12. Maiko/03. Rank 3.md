Maiko   
Hey, hey!   
Have you seen Stripey?   
Angry - We were playing tag, but... I dunno where he went.   
   
Maiko   
Happy - Oh! Stripey! There you are!   
   
Thin Young Man   
......   
   
Maiko   
You don't look so good... Are you sick?   
   
Thin Young Man   
Yes... I'm surprised you could tell.   
   
Maiko   
Sad - Huh...? You really are sick?   
   
Thin Young Man   
Happy - Haha, no. I was kidding. You're so easy, Maiko.   
   
Maiko   
Angry - No fair, I trusted you! Don't tease me just 'cause I'm a kid!   
   
Thin Young Man   
...And who are you?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'm Maiko's friend.   
Just a random passerby.   
   
Thin Young Man   
Ahh... So you're the one she was talking about. I was wondering what you were like...   
Do you see yourself as her guardian, or are you simply two children playing together?   
   
Maiko   
Happy - Hey, I'm hungry now! I want takoyaki! Takoyaki!   
   
Maiko   
Happy - You can eat with us too, Stripey!   
   
Thin Young Man   
No... I'll pass, thanks.   
See you later.   
   
Maiko   
Angry - He's gone...   
I usually see him around **the shrine** on **Sundays**.   
I pass by on the way to cram school.   
Happy - Okay, it's takoyaki time!   
   
Thin Young Man   
It's rare to see people pass by this shrine.   
Usually, it's as quiet as the grave around here.   
......   
   
Thin Young Man   
Well, I'd better be going. It's starting to get cold.   
   
Maiko   
Angry - Huh? Did he already leave?   
I usually see him around **the shrine** on **Sundays**.   
I pass by on the way to cram school.   
Whew, running makes me hungry!   
Happy - Let's get takoyaki!   
   
---   
   
Maiko   
Happy - Whew! It's so hot, I almost burned myself!   
I remember one time my dad burned his mouth on this stuff!   
...'Cause I put too many in his mouth at once.   
He was like, "Gyaaaaaah!"   
Angry - ......   
   
Maiko   
Angry - ...Dad hasn't been coming home much these days.   
Angry - But it's my birthday soon...   
Angry - Do you think he'll come home and see me?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
He'll probably forget.   
I really can't say.   
Don't worry, he'll be there.   
   
Maiko   
Sad - Yeah... I bet he forgot...   
   
Maiko   
Sad - I don't know what to think...   
   
Maiko   
You really think so!?   
   
Maiko   
My mom always gives me presents on my birthday.   
Angry - But she hasn't asked me what I want this year yet...   
Angry - ......   
   
Maiko   
Angry - If they really loved me, they wouldn't get a divorce.   
Angry - You're the only one who spends time with me...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Maiko seems to have taken a liking to me.   
I feel like we're growing closer...   
   
Maiko   
Oh, I have to go home! Today's laundry day.   
If I don't do laundry, the house gets really messy!   
Happy - See you later, okay?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Maiko headed off, and I   
returned to the dorm.

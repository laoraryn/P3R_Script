Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
No sign of Miyamoto.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Hey, Arisato-kun, I just got a text from Kaz.   
It's for you, but he wanted you to know ASAP, so he texted me, too.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Angry - It says, "Come to Iwatodai Station." What is that guy thinking? He skipped practice today, too!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
After practice, I made my   
way to Iwatodai Station.

Kazushi Miyamoto   
Surprised - Whoa, Arisato! Where's the fire!?   
Sad - Yuko was pissed, wasn't she? I've missed a lot of practice lately.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - I should've told you last time, but um, my X-ray results...   
Sad - The muscles and tendons around my knee are inflamed.   
Sad - The doctor said if I keep pushing it that I... won't be able to walk anymore.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
He said I strained it too hard during practice. So freakin' stupid...   
Sad - I want to win, so I have to practice.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
There's nothing you can do.   
Show some guts, man!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Angry - That's not an excuse!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Y-Yeah! You're right!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Angry - Every minute—every second counts! I can't waste any more time!   
Angry - I promised I'd win at next year's meet and become the number one athlete in Japan.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You promised?   
Why go so far?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Yeah... I made a promise.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Well, because it's not just about me.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
My nephew got into an accident, and his legs got messed up.   
And now he can't walk.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
But if he goes through rehab, he might be able to recover!   
He says the rehab hurts too much, though, so he doesn't want to do it.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
He's only five, y'know? There's still so much he hasn't done yet.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
So I made a deal with my nephew. Just, uh... don't laugh, okay?   
If I become number one in Japan, he'll agree to go through rehab.   
That's why I have to win this meet—so I can make it to nationals!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Do you think you can win?   
What about your knee?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - To tell you the truth... I don't think I can do it.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Thanks for caring, man... but I can't worry about that now.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Sorry for all the trouble I've caused. And for all the depressing conversations.   
Sad - It's really tough keeping it all bottled up. You were the only one I could talk to.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Miyamoto opened up to   
me about his troubles.   
I feel like we're becoming closer...   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Yuko has good instincts when it comes to this stuff, so she might say something to you.   
Tell her to come talk to me if she does. I don't wanna drag you into this any deeper.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I parted ways with Miyamoto   
and went back to the dorm.

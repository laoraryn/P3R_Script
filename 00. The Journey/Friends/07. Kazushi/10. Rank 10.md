How're you holding up, Kaz?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Hurt - My knee's not so good. I can't put too much weight on it.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Okay, then let's take an early break.   
You mind giving Kaz's leg a quick massage?   
   
Second-Year Club Member   
No problem. Let's see that leg.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Sorry. You're missing practice because of me.   
   
Second-Year Club Member   
Hey, don't be like that! This is for your nephew, right?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Still, I'm really sorry.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I started on my way back   
to the dorm after practice.

Kazushi Miyamoto   
Heeey, Arisato!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Do you have a minute?   
There's something I wanna talk to you about.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Okay, let's hear it.   
What is it about?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Ah, actually, let's go somewhere else. I don't want anyone from the team hearing.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Plus it might take a while, so...   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Ah, actually, I don't want anyone from the team overhearing.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Let's go somewhere—anywhere.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The scent of broiled fish fills   
the air inside the restaurant.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Ahh, where do I even start...? It's all a mess in my head.   
First things first—this is for you.

My nephew gave it to me. He said it's a good luck charm.   
Happy - He gave me more than I'll ever need.   
Happy - If you get hurt during practice, now you can tape yourself up.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
I wanted you to be the first to know...   
I've made up my mind. I'm going to have surgery to fix my knee.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What about the big meet?   
What about your promise?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - I don't think there's enough time for me to recover by then. But that's okay.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - I probably won't be able to keep it. Guess I'll owe him an explanation.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
I don't mean to pout or anything. I'm just trying to stop making selfish choices.   
I don't think it's right for the whole team to suffer because of my knee and my nephew.   
Even if I managed to win, I don't think I'd feel good about it afterward.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Up until now, all I could think about was winning.   
Happy - But my eyes opened up after Coach grilled you about my knee.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - It was such an obvious thing—I realized I can't keep thinking only about myself.   
Winning still means a lot to me. That's part of who I am, and that's probably not going to change. But for now...   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - I'm not gonna worry about winning races. I'm gonna focus on winning back my health instead!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You've got this!   
You've really grown up.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Haha, well I can't exactly force myself to heal, y'know?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Y-You think so? In a good way, right? Like I'm more mature?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Anyway, I can't just keep asking for your help all the time.   
Happy - That said, thanks for everything you've done for me so far.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Between practice and rehab, I'll have a lot going on. But I'm gonna kick butt at both of them.   
Happy - And someday, I'll kick your butt too, Arisato.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Miyamoto shared how   
much he cares about me.   
I feel like we're becoming closer...

The Chariot Social Link reached its maximum level! You can now fuse **Thor**, the mighty god of thunder!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
I'm gonna go tell my nephew what happened and offer to go through rehab with him.   
Happy - I wonder which one of us will recover first. He's a tough one, you know. Just like me.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I passed the time chatting   
away with Miyamoto.

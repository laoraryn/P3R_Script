You've probably all heard already, but Miyamoto's knee is in bad shape.   
If you see him having a hard time, I want you to stop him immediately.

That's it for today!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Let's grab a bite before we head home.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I left school with Miyamoto.

Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Sorry I needed your shoulder again. And I was the one who suggested we go eat...   
Sad - I'm sure you love lugging all this dead weight around, huh?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I don't mind at all.   
No, not exactly.   
It's fine—I'm tough as hell.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Really? Well, I guess you haven't been complaining.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
I mean, I've always known you were tough.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - H-Hey, you don't have to go saying that.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
I mean, I know you're a pretty tough guy.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Yeah. Maybe, but...   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - I've realized that being tough isn't always the answer.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sometimes when I go to my sister's to play with my nephew, I help him into the tub.   
Sad - Even though he's only five, he's still pretty heavy. It must be hard having to do that every day.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - If I can't walk, then I won't be able to go to school or bathe by myself.   
Sad - I won't even be able to go to the bathroom on my own. And I don't want to do that to my mom.   
Sad - This all hit me on our walk over here with you helping me the entire way.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Hey, let me know if I become a burden on you, will ya?   
I'm not gonna hide anything from you, so I hope you feel like you don't have to, either.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Miyamoto really cares about me a lot.   
I feel like we're becoming closer...   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - I feel guilty for making the whole team worry.   
Sad - But first, I have to win at the regionals no matter what. For their sake, too.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Miyamoto and I finished eating   
and walked home together.

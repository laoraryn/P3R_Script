Happy - Alright! One more time!   
Happy - I'll show you what I'm made of!

...Huh?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Hurt - Hngh!   
Hurt - D-Dammit, seriously!?

Anemia?   
   
Second-Year Club Member   
C'mon, we're counting on you to be captain next year.   
   
Third-Year Club Member   
The big meet's next year, so you've got time. Just don't overdo it.

Hey, Arisato, why don't you leave practice early and take him home?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - ...Sorry.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Angry - What are you looking at? I'm fine.   
Sad - It's just, um... my anemia's acting up.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sorry, that sounds awful!   
Are you going to be okay?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Oh, no, no. I-It's nothing serious...   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - O-Of course. It's just, you know, a touch of anemia...   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Angry - Argh, dammit! I can't do it! I can't lie to you!   
Sad - Look, the truth is...   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - It's my knee. It hasn't felt right ever since that day you first came to practice.   
Sad - I tried medicine, I tried wrapping it, but the pain won't stop.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Will it heal?   
Take a break from practice.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Of course it will! But I can't afford to stop training, so I'll play through the pain!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Angry - No can do. And there's no way you're gonna make me.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Next year, there's a national competition.   
Athletes from all over Japan will be there. The regionals don't hold a candle in comparison.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
And if I want to win, then I have to spend the next year training!   
Sad - A lot of guys on the team are nosy as hell. If they find out about my knee, they won't leave me alone.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - So please, keep it a secret, okay? We gotta look out for each other!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Miyamoto seems to be counting on me.   
I feel like we're becoming closer...   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
If I go easy on it, I can make it home by myself.   
Don't worry about me. You get on back to training.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I parted ways with Miyamoto   
and went home after practice.

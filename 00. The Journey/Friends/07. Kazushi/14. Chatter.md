Jersey-Wearing Student   
Happy - Whew, all done! Guess I'll go run some laps now!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Ahh... That felt great.   
Happy - It takes guts to sleep during class. If you get caught, you might get a piece of chalk to the forehead.   
Happy - But if you've got **the courage to doze off** anyway, I guess you've got nothing to fear at that point.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Well, since I'm already wearing my jersey...   
Happy - ...I think I'll try to race the monorail today!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Yo, Arisato!   
The past is history! I'm looking forward to the future!   
Happy - You too, right?   
Happy - ...But, if you ever need help, don't be afraid to ask! You can count on me!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel an unbreakable bond   
with Miyamoto...   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - 'Sup, Arisato!   
You headin' to practice today?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Oh, Arisato... You goin' to practice today?   
Sad - ...Sorry, man. Just go on ahead without me.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Miyamoto is acting strangely...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend some time   
after school at track practice?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Go to practice

Sad - ...Yeah, I'm gonna head over, too. Just gimme a sec.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Huh? You're not going today?   
Dude, how are you gonna get on my level if you're slackin'? You'd better shape up.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
...Alright, see you around.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Looks like it's about time to head to practice.

Kazushi Miyamoto   
Whew... What's the plan for today?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Hey, you headin' to practice? Better hurry and get changed.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Oh yeah. You headin' to practice? Better hurry and get changed.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Nice, let's go!   
Happy - Today, let's see what you're made of. But don't overdo it, alright?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
'Sup? Class finally let out, huh?   
Happy - You leavin' for practice now? Wanna head to the track together?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Oh, right. You leavin' for practice now? Wanna head to the track together?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - That's what I like to hear!   
Can't have you showin' me up all the time. Time to put my game face on!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Hey, Arisato. You gonna head to practice?

Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Gotcha, see you in a bit.   
...Let everyone else know that, too, would you? I'm not skippin' or anything.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Hey, how you doin'? I'm gonna get a ton of laps in today.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto

Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Alright, let's go!   
Oh, hold up, I forgot to swap out the cleats on my shoes.   
I'll catch up with you in a bit.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Yo, you headin' to practice?   
Happy - ...Oh, c'mon, don't give me that look. I'm fine!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Oh, you headin' to practice?   
Happy - ...Oh, c'mon, don't give me that look. I'm fine!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Nice, let's get pumped up! Today's gonna be the day I beat you!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Hey, you're headin' to practice, right? I'm feelin' pretty good about myself today.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - You're headin' to practice, right? I'm feelin' pretty good about myself today.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Awesome! I can't get psyched up without you there, you feel me?   
Sad - I've been slowing down lately, so I gotta go twice as hard now.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
You up for some running, Arisato? Let's head on down to the track.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Oh yeah, you up for some running, Arisato? Let's head on down to the track.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Well, I can't push myself too hard, but at the very least, I gotta be there to support you.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Hey, there you are. Let's head to practice, Arisato!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Whoops, I almost forgot. Let's head to practice, Arisato!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sweet. I'll race you downstairs—!   
Happy - ...Juuust kidding. Let's save that for the track, yeah?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Huh? You're not going today?   
Dude, how are you gonna get on my level if you're slackin'? You'd better shape up.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Huh? You're not going today?   
You're gonna eat my dust if you don't shape up. At least practice in your own time.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Not Used   
   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - ...Oh, alright. See you then.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
...Oh yeah? Well, get some running in whenever you can.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Huh? You're not going today?   
You better hope you're not getting rusty! 'Cause I don't plan on losin' to you!   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - What? You're not going today...?   
I totally get it if you're busy, but... you better not be running from a rematch.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Oh... I was kinda hopin' I'd see you there.   
Well, try and show up next time, alright?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Huh? You're not going today?   
Happy - You're never gonna beat me in the future if you're off slacking around!

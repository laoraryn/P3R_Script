Kazushi Miyamoto   
Angry - I swear I usually don't go jumpin' into fights or anything...   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Angry - Man, can you believe they were startin' shit? Talk about being a sore loser.   
Angry - Did they seriously think they could stand a chance against me in a real fight?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
If you didn't stop me back there, I probably would've beaten the crap outta them...   
Anyway... Sorry about all of that.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You'd be in trouble.   
I was worried about you.   
Gotta pick your battles.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Angry - Guess you're right. Not like I'd lose to a bunch of tantrum-throwing nobodies anyways.   
Sad - But yeah... It's pretty stupid to risk injury when we've got a competition soon.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Looks like Miyamoto's cooled his head off.   
I learned a little more about him today.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Angry - What, you think I'd lose to those guys? They're just a bunch of tantrum-throwing nobodies!   
Angry - Or is it because of my knee? Ha, they would've needed that handicap!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Miyamoto looks angry.   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Y-Yeah, you're right... It doesn't mean shit if I win against those guys.   
Sad - It's just my knee, man. I've been on edge lately 'cause of it...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Miyamoto seems impressed.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Guess I owe you one. C'mon, I'll treat you. Let's get some food.   
Happy - I'm pretty fast at paying people back. Almost as fast as I can run!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
After enjoying a meal together,   
I headed back to the dorm.

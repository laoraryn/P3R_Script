Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Hey, sorry for dumping some real heavy stuff on you last time, but you think you could help me out again?   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
I'm going to my sister's place today, and I wanna get something for my nephew...   
I'm pretty bad at picking out presents and stuff, so I figured I could ask you for a second opinion.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - What should I get a five-year-old kid who's injured his leg...?   
Sad - Any ideas?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Running shoes.   
A video game.   
Clothes.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - Dude, I just told you... His leg is injured.   
Sad - Were you even listening to me? Man, did I go to the wrong guy for help?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Miyamoto seems disappointed by my answer.   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - That makes sense... That way, he won't be bored at home.   
Happy - But games can be pretty expensive— No! This is for my nephew! Anything for my nephew!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Miyamoto seems to be having a lot of fun.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Sad - So we, two high school students, are gonna go shopping in the KIDS' section?   
Sad - Uh, wouldn't that look kinda weird? But I'm doing this for my nephew... Guess it's time to put all that mental training to the test!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Miyamoto seems to be taking this seriously.   
I learned a little more about him today.   
   
Kazushi Miyamoto   
Happy - Alright, let's get going! I'm countin' on you, Arisato!   
Sad - And, uh... if I don't have enough money... you mind spottin' me?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
After going shopping with Miyamoto,   
I headed back to the dorm.

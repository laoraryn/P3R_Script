Yukari Takeba   
I think I'm just going to go out and find something to eat.   
Sad - Sorry... I'm not in much of a cooking mood today.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari seems upset...   
I should work to repair our relationship   
first, then maybe we could cook together.   
   
-------   
   
   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I got enthusiastic about cooking for myself for once... but I bought way too many ingredients.   
Sad - I am gonna have a lot of leftovers on my hands...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Since we're getting closer to the day of our mission, I wanted to cook something healthy, but... I bought way too many ingredients.   
Sad - I am gonna have a lot of leftovers on my hands...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
The moon will be full in two days, so I figured I'd cook something hearty...   
Sad - I kind of overestimated how much I would need and bought too many ingredients. Looks like I'll have a lot of leftovers...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
The next battle is going to be our last, so I wanted to cook myself something healthy in preparation.   
Sad - I might have gone a little nuts and overstocked the fridge, though. I'm gonna have a lot of leftovers...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Looks like Yukari wants   
me to cook with her...   
Should I spend the evening with Yukari?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Arisato-kun, will you help me out?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure, I'll help.   
Sorry, I'm not hungry.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, you got a sec?   
You know that sautéed chicken I messed up last time? I figured out what went wrong. This time, I'm gonna do it right.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You got a sec?   
You know that sautéed chicken I messed up last time? I figured out what went wrong. This time, I'm gonna do it right.   
Happy - Plus, the next full moon's less than a week away... We deserve to eat something hearty, don't we?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, Arisato-kun, do you have a minute?   
You know that sautéed chicken I messed up last time? I figured out what went wrong. This time, I'm gonna do it right.   
...Also, it's almost a full moon, and I could use a task to distract myself.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, hey, Arisato-kun.   
I'm thinking about trying my hand at that chicken sauté I messed up last time.   
Happy - And maybe cooking will help me de-stress a little about our final battle coming up. I could use a sous-chef, though.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Sounds like Yukari wants to cook together.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Wanna help? Come on, anyone can do it.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's get cooking.   
Maybe later.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, Arisato-kun. Did you eat dinner already?   
I'm thinking about making some food...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, hey. Have you eaten yet?   
I was just about to get some dinner ready.   
Happy - The full moon's less than a week away, so I thought I'd make something a little healthier.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, did you already eat dinner?   
I was just about to start cooking...   
Our mission is coming up, so we gotta make sure to eat well.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, did you already eat dinner, Arisato-kun?   
I was just about to get started in the kitchen...   
The next mission is gonna be our last. Eating something healthy seems appropriate, all things considered.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari is all fired up.   
Yukari might gain a new ability soon...   
Should I spend the evening with her?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
If you've got time on your hands, do you want to make some food together?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure, let's do it.   
Maybe another time.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I'm thinking about putting some food together...   
Happy - If you've got some time on your hands, do you want to cook with me?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Since our operation is coming up, I'm trying to think of something healthy to make.   
Happy - Did you wanna cook together?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I was thinking about getting to work in the kitchen to take my mind off of things.   
Happy - If you've got some time, we should cook together. What do you say?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
The next battle will be our last... I gotta start preparing myself. Admittedly, I'm pretty nervous.   
Happy - As much as I want some comfort food, I should probably make something healthy. Wanna give me a hand with food prep?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It doesn't seem like Yukari will gain any   
more new skills even if I cook with her...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
How about it? Sous-chef gets the leftovers.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure, I'll help.   
Maybe another time.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Awesome. Let's go make something tasty.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
All right. I'll be here if you change your mind.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, hey. Did you want to make something?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend the evening with Yukari?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I'd love it if you could lend me a hand.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey there. Did you want to spend some time in the kitchen?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It doesn't seem like Yukari will gain any   
more new skills even if I cook with her...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
If you wanted to help out, I'd really appreciate it.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts

Yukari Takeba   
If you wanted to help out, I'd really appreciate it.   
   
-----   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari looks serious...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
We spent time cooking together...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Mmm... Putting in the effort to cook a homemade meal always makes it taste extra good!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Well, shall we start cleaning up?   
   
-----   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I picked up the ingredients to make chicken sauté today, but...   
I might have bought too much. I think my eyes are bigger than my stomach.   
I always end up having leftovers. What about you, Arisato-kun? Would you say you're a big eater?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I eat like a bird.   
I eat like a pig.   
Depends on the taste.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Really? Aren't you a growing boy? I thought you'd be eating a lot.   
Sad - Then again, you are pretty slim, so I guess it makes sense.   
Hmm... Today's portion might be too much, then.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Ooh, sounds like a healthy appetite! You're in luck, because we've got plenty!   
Sad - I hope it tastes all right, but...   
Sad - Don't get your hopes too high, okay? I haven't been cooking much lately.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Come on, you're worried before I even make it?   
Sad - I'm sure it helps if it tastes good, but don't set your expectations too high...   
Um, let me just apologize in advance.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Well, either way... it'll be packed full of nutrients, so don't worry about that!   
Happy - They say your health is your most valuable asset, y'know? I figured we should think about what we're putting into our bodies.   
Happy - And if I could lose some weight while we're at it, I'd kill two birds with one stone... But let's put that aside for now.   
Happy - Anyway, why don't we start with veggies? Arisato-kun, can you cut the tomatoes for me?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I made chicken sauté with Yukari...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - Urgh...   
Looking away - I chose breast meat because it was cheap, and I heard it's good for a diet, but...   
Looking away - It's kinda dry... Okay, very dry. I can barely chew through it...   
Looking away - Man, that was unexpected... I don't usually mess up this kind of thing.   
Angry - H-Hey! You're doubting me, aren't you? I'm serious!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - I'll make up for it next time, so let's cook together again when you get the chance!   
Angry - It'll be so delicious, you can't help saying "yum!"   
   
-----   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - All right. This should be enough!   
Happy - There was a program on TV the other day showing how to make tender chicken breasts.   
Happy - Slice against the grain, marinate it in sauce, and then cook gently at a low temperature...   
Happy - I'm gonna reclaim my pride today! Just you wait!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Good luck.   
Guess we'll see.   
I have concerns.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Thanks! You can count on me.   
Happy - I'll make it so good you'll be asking for seconds!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Come on, have a little faith! I did some serious research, y'know.   
Happy - I'll show you what I'm really made of. Just forget about last time, okay?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Hey, that's just mean. But I guess after what happened last time, I can't really blame you...   
Angry - That's why I'm gonna go all out today. I'll prove that I've learned from my research.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - So, we have to wash our hands first, and then... Arisato-kun, you're in charge of the rice and veggies.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I made chicken sauté with Yukari...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Mm...!   
Happy - It's so tender and juicy... Way better than last time!   
Happy - See!? This is what I'm capable of! I knew I could do it if I tried.   
Happy - Hehe, I can tell you like it too, Arisato-kun.   
Happy - That look on your face says it all! I couldn't help but laugh when you started wolfing it down.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, but... you didn't actually say "yum"...   
......   
Happy - Anyway, let's eat up! We still have cleaning to do after this.

-----   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I'm thinking of using the cabbage in the fridge to make a cream stew.   
Happy - I've heard it's healthy from leaf to core, so I'll go ahead and use the entire thing!   
Happy - As you can see, I've done my homework. Did you come prepared?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Prepared for what?   
Looking forward to it.   
I have my doubts.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You know, uh... Well, whatever.   
I'll ask you again once you've eaten it.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I'm back on my game after making that perfect chicken sauté.   
Happy - This'll be no problem at all!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Geez, you have no faith...   
Sad - That chicken sauté I made was pretty good, wasn't it?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Okay, less talking, more cooking!   
I'll handle the main dish with the cabbage, so how about you start on the rice and stuff?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I cooked together with Yukari...   
......   
The cream stew is mild and delicious...!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Whew, I'm stuffed! We made short work of that, huh?   
Happy - So, Arisato-kun? How'd you like today's meal?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yum!   
Not too shabby.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Oh! You said it! You actually said "yum"!   
Finally! I just had to get you to say it today.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
C'mon, there's no need to hold back. Either way, I'm satisfied with it.   
Happy - While we were eating, I could see "yum" written all over your face!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Hey, remember what I said the very first time we cooked together?   
Happy - That I'd make it so delicious, you couldn't help saying "yum"? I'm pretty stubborn, you know.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - But I gotta say, it's nice seeing the look on someone's face when they're eating something they really like.   
It's not just about proving myself. It's that I really wanted to see that smile again.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
What, did that make me sound selfless? Sorry, but this is still a two-way street!   
Happy - Next time it's your turn to do something for me! Let's make some yummy memories together.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
After the successful meal,   
Yukari is smiling warmly...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Thanks for today. Let's do this again when you have some time.   
Okay, let's hurry and get this cleaned up.

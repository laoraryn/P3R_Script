Sad - I was going to watch this DVD I borrowed, but I don't think I'm up for it today...   
Sad - Maybe some other time...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari seems upset...   
Maybe if I worked to repair our relationship   
first, we could watch a DVD together...

Yukari Takeba   
One of my classmates lent me a DVD of this show she's been watching.   
I've been curious about it for a while, and apparently it's gotten some pretty good ratings.   
I could use a break, so I was thinking about sitting down and giving it a watch.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, Arisato-kun.   
One of the girls in my class let me borrow a DVD of this show she's been watching.   
I was thinking about watching it in my room, but it might be better to watch it out here since the TV is bigger.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Watching this DVD with Yukari might   
help improve my ...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, what's up, Arisato-kun? Did you wanna watch with me?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, let's watch together.   
Maybe later.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Right now, the Temperance Arcana   
may help me grow even more...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I haven't been able to stop thinking about how that show ended last time, so I borrowed the next DVD.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Watching the show with Yukari might   
help improve my ...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
So, how about it, Arisato-kun? You up to watch more of this zombie show with me?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's do this.   
Maybe later.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
This is it. I borrowed the last volume of the series you and I have been watching.   
It's been a wild ride, and while I'm sad the story's ending, I can't wait to watch how they wrap things up.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari is really looking forward to this...   
Watching with her might help   
improve my ...   
Yukari might gain a new ability soon...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Well, Arisato-kun? You ready for the finale?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's do this.   
Not now.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I borrowed a DVD of another show. I hear this one's supposed to be kinda scary, too.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It doesn't seem like Yukari will gain any more   
new skills even if I watch a DVD with her...   
But watching this show with her might   
help improve my ...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
How about it? Wanna watch with me?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Absolutely.   
Maybe another time.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - All right, then. Let's get into it!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Gotcha. Talk to me if you change your mind.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, what's up? Ooh, are you actually interested in watching that DVD?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Watching the show with Yukari might   
help improve my ...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I'll go ahead and get it set up.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey there. Did you still want to watch that show?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It doesn't seem like Yukari will gain any more   
new skills even if I watch a DVD with her...   
But watching this show with her might   
help improve my ...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I'll go ahead and get it set up.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Watching the show with Yukari might   
help improve my ...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I'll go ahead and get it set up.   
   
-----   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari seems to be having fun.   
We enjoyed watching a DVD together...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Phew, that was fun!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
By observing the main character, I've begun to   
understand the  of an adult...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Well, we should probably head to bed. Have a good night!   
   
-----   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Whoa, that teaser was so dramatic! It's like the stuff from overseas.   
Happy - This series is known for having a strong female protagonist.   
Sad - I've been curious about it for a while, but I heard it also has horror elements...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sounds exciting.   
Are you scared?   
Yikes...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Wait, really!? You're totally fine with that stuff?   
Happy - That's actually perfect! I'll try to push through, then.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - N-No way! I've been totally looking forward to this!   
Happy - It's just... this kind of thing is way more fun to watch with someone else, y'know?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Wait, you're bad with horror too?   
Happy - I-I mean! I'm totally cool with that stuff. You'll be fine as long as we watch it together!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Oh wait, it's starting! Man, the tension is palpable...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
That cliffhanger really made me wanna know what happens next! I guess it was more zombies than horror, huh.   
Happy - The main girl was just an ordinary person, but she stood so strong in the face of adversity... I love that!   
Happy - I feel like I was able to focus on the story thanks to you, Arisato-kun. I'll let you know when I borrow the next one.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
By observing the main character, I've begun to   
understand the  of an adult...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Whew... I'm gonna head off to bed. Good night!   
   
-----   
   
Yukari Takeba   
This series always has such crazy plot twists.   
Angry - When the main girl's best friend betrayed her... I was like, "WHAT!?"   
Sad - Being backstabbed by the one person you trusted most is just horrible.   
What would you do if that happened to you?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's whatever.   
I'd never recover.   
Forgive and forget.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Ahaha... You're not bothered by anything, huh? But that's just something special about you, Arisato-kun.   
Sad - I find it quite difficult to think like that...   
Sad - It wasn't really a betrayal, but I was reminded of a time a girl I was close to suddenly started avoiding me.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Yeah... Even without a dramatic betrayal, I'd be hurt if a friend started treating me differently.   
Sad - That happened to me once. A girl I was close to suddenly started avoiding me.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Arisato-kun... That's awfully admirable. You sound just like the main character.   
Sad - To be honest... there was once a girl I was close to who suddenly started avoiding me.   
Sad - It wasn't a full-blown betrayal or anything, but I was so hurt by that. It's hard to forgive and forget.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Shoot, it's starting! It's so fast-paced, we really need to pay attention.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - No way! It's just gonna end like that!?   
Exasperated* - Ugh, it happens every time, but they're so good at leaving you hanging...   
Angry - I need to know how it ends. Let's watch more next time, okay?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
By observing the main character, I've begun to   
understand the  of an adult...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - It's getting pretty late... We'd better head back to our rooms.

Yukari Takeba   
Angry - We're finally at the last episode... I wonder how it's going to end.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Y'know, about this series...   
I mentioned before how it caught my attention, but I was afraid it might be too scary for me...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very happy* - But I'm glad I watched it! Guess it's important to break out of your comfort zone sometimes.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Do you ever try watching things from genres you don't normally get into?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Bring it on.   
Not really.   
If I'm with someone.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Oh, wow. I could learn a thing or two from you.   
Happy - Trying out all kinds of shows seems like a good way to find hidden gems.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Haha, I'm like that too. Like, what if you try it and it turns out to be horrible?   
Happy - But as we've seen, you never know when it might pay off to break out of your comfort zone.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I'm the same way. Isn't it easier to try something new when you have someone with you for the ride?   
Happy - It's also nice to be able to comment on it and see the other person's reaction.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Watching this together made me realize how much I appreciated the main character.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Like how she can't turn a blind eye to people in need, and extends her hand to almost anyone...   
Happy - And of course, the way she kept pressing forward, no matter what happened. It was so inspiring.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Come to think of it, isn't she just like you...?   
Happy - Hehe! That might be a stretch.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Remember how I told you about that girl I was close to who started ignoring me one day?   
Sad - It's not like I did anything to make her hate me.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - We'd been friends for a long time. But one day, out of the blue, she just said...   
Sad - "My mother told me I can't play with you anymore."   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - It's because there were rumors floating around about my parents.   
Sad - I kind of get it now, looking back, but... at the time, I was just... sad.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Uh, what I'm trying to say is...   
Happy - This show made me realize I'd like to be a little more like the main character.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I want to be the kind of person who'd help anyone, at any time. Someone who's kind and strong.   
It might be silly to say I look up to a fictional character, but there's no harm in following her example. At least that's what I think.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari has been inspired by the protagonist   
of the show we watched on DVD...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Oh! The last episode's starting!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very happy* - That ending was so good! I hope they'll make a sequel...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
By observing the main character, I've begun to   
understand the  of an adult...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I'll bring more DVDs I'm curious about next time!   
Happy - It's about time we head back to our rooms. Have a good night, okay?

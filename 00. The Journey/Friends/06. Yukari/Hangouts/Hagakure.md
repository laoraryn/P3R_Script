Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Whew, thanks for lunch. This place never disappoints.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Oh...   
Um...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - I...   
Sad - Yeah, I have a pretty big appetite, huh? Haha...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You're like a black hole.   
Do you want mine, too?   
It's a healthy appetite.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - W-Well, I can't help it. I get hungry after practice!   
......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - But, I still don't wanna eat too much...   
Um, I'm not hungry anymore... Thanks.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari seems anxious...   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - Uh... Well, to be honest, I do, but...   
I wouldn't wanna take your meal from you...   
Happy - Ugh, no... I can't resist... Okay, I'll have some! Thanks!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari seems to be enjoying herself.   
I learned a little more about her today.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Y-You think?   
...Hey, what's with that smirk?   
Happy - A "healthy appetite," huh... Heh.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari seems happy.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Hey, wanna take the long way home today? I gotta work off that meal.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
After eating, we walked around for   
a bit before returning to the dorm.

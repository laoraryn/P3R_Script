Yukari Takeba   
Happy - It's kinda weird hanging out here on our day off, don't ya think?   
Someone might start a rumor if they see us...   
Happy - ...Oh well. I guess it's too late to worry about that now... Haha.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, by the way, what do you usually do on your days off?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - I-I'm not trying to pry or anything. I was just curious...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Hang out with a friend.   
Stay in my room.   
I never remember.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I-I see. Just like what we're doing today, huh?   
Happy - Of course, I'm sure everyone likes hanging out with you, Arisato-kun.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari is nodding her head.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Really? How come I never noticed? We live in the same dorm.   
Happy - Then, um... you should come look for me. Aren't you lonely all by yourself?   
Happy - Yeah, I think that'd be fun.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari is nodding her head.   
I learned a little more about her today.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - What? There's no way you can't remember something like that.   
Surprised - Or maybe you just don't want to admit that you stay in your room doing nothing.   
Exasperated* - You know, living like that is a shortcut to aging poorly.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari seems worried about me.   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Huh? It's already this late? Time only flies when it's our day off...   
Happy - Let's stop by one more place before going back. We have to make the most of our time!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The two of us hung out for a while   
before going back to the dorm.

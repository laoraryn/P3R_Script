Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Hey...   
Sad - Do you remember when those guys stole my wallet, and you came to help me?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Um...   
Sad - Sorry I got so mad at you.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - I was just frustrated...   
Looking away - I don't like having to depend on other people... But it ended up happening anyway.   
Looking away - ......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You know, I couldn't say it at the time, but...   
I'm actually glad you came.   
Maybe because it's... you, Arisato.   
So, I want to thank you properly.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Thanks for your help back then. I really appreciate it.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You're quite welcome.   
Anytime.   
Thank you, too.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Well, well, look who's being so polite now. Ahaha.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari seems relieved to have   
gotten that off her chest.   
We appear to be growing even closer...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - It was honestly kinda cool.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari seems relieved to have   
gotten that off her chest.   
We appear to be growing even closer...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Haha, what are you thanking me for, Arisato-kun?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari seems relieved to have   
gotten that off her chest.   
We appear to be growing even closer...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Whew! That's a big weight off my shoulders.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Let's head back down.   
The roof doesn't get a lot of foot traffic, so I think it's a good place to have serious conversations.   
But... couples tend to sneak up here too. If anyone sees us, the rumor mill might go crazy again.   
Wouldn't that be annoying, Arisato-kun? Y'know, if people assumed we were dating...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I wouldn't mind.   
Yeah...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Ahaha, really? I'm not sure if you're being brave or oblivious...   
Still, that's something special about you. You don't get bogged down by what other people think.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I know, right? Rumors are seriously no joke.   
Exasperated* - When people saw us coming to school together, it took forever to set the record straight.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Achoo! Uh-oh, they say a sneeze means someone's talking about you. Well, it's probably nothing...   
Happy - Let's head on home, yeah?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari and I returned to the dorm...

Sad - I'm so nervous for some reason...   
Sad - The others are here in the dorm too... I hope no one finds out I snuck you into my room.   
Sad - They'll hear me if I'm too loud...

Surprised - ...!   
Surprised - Wait, I didn't mean it like that! Don't get the wrong idea, okay!?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Too late.   
I didn't say anything.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - H-Hey! You don't need to say it! Geez...   
Angry - Whatever!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - A-Ah, right... Nothing at all.   
Exasperated* - ...Am I always this crazy?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, right... I wanted to give you something.   
This is for you.

NOT USED   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You know what it is, right? It's the strap from my cell phone.   
I got it at the opening ceremony for the Moonlight Bridge.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It's been my special keepsake for years now...   
Because my dad bought it for me.   
......   
I used to talk to the little charm attached to it when I was alone in my room.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Haha... You must think I'm nuts, huh?   
But ever since I got to know you, I've stopped talking to it.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Um, it means a lot to me, so I should explain why I'm giving it to you...   
Sad - I'm only gonna say this once, okay?   
Sad - ......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I... I love you.   
Happy - ......   
Surprised - Th-That's it!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari has professed her love for me,   
and seems to want mine in return...

Yukari Takeba   
Hey, when this is all over... Maybe we can spend some time together, just the two of us.   
I-In fact... would it be all right if I jumped the gun a bit, and... took some of that time right now?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I'm not ready to say goodnight yet.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I-I'm blushing, aren't I...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I shared a special evening with Yukari.

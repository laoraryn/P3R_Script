Yukari Takeba   
I was actually kinda nervous when I got on the monorail this morning.   
Sad - I can't stop thinking about how we really cut it close that time...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, Arisato-kun...   
Sad - You know, those rumors... They are a little creepy.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Did you find out anything about the ghost story?   
Angry - I'm gonna prove to everyone that it was just a rumor.   
Sad - ...And I'm not scared, all right!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, Arisato-kun, don't forget about today, okay?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Seems like Yamagishi-san is still asleep.   
Sad - I can't help but worry about her...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Yamagishi-san is leaving the hospital soon. Isn't that great?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I'm glad there won't be a full moon for a while, but still...   
I can't help thinking about it.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Arisato-kun...   
Sad - It's still not clear to me... My head hurts from thinking about it.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...I thought about everything, Arisato-kun...   
Angry - I don't think we have a choice. We have to do this no matter what.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It's almost time for exams...   
Sad - The third-years are really smart, so we better score well if we don't want them to laugh at us.   
Exasperated* - Hm... Maybe I should study in the library. I get so tired when I study late at night...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Whew... We're finally done with exams.   
Very happy* - They were sooo hard! Right now, all I wanna do is kick back and relax.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, Arisato-kun. I saw the exam results...   
Sad - Well, um... it's okay. Test scores aren't everything in life, right?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, Arisato-kun. I saw the exam results...   
Happy - I don't think that was your best work. Were you having a bad day?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, Arisato-kun.   
Happy - I saw the exam results. You did pretty well.   
Happy - I bet our senpais will be happy to see that.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, Arisato-kun.   
Happy - I saw the exam results. You were really high up on the list!   
Very happy* - Kirijo-senpai seemed impressed. Maybe she'll even give you some kind of reward...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, Arisato-kun.   
Happy - I saw the exam results. You were really high up on the list!   
Very happy* - Mitsuru-senpai seemed impressed. Maybe she'll even give you some kind of reward...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, Arisato-kun.   
Surprised - I saw the exam results. I can't believe you came out on top!   
Very happy* - I bet Kirijo-senpai is impressed. Maybe she'll even give you some kind of reward...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, Arisato-kun.   
Surprised - I saw the exam results. I can't believe you came out on top!   
Very happy* - I bet Mitsuru-senpai is impressed. Maybe she'll even give you some kind of reward...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, Arisato-kun.   
Have you heard that the art club is accepting new members?   
Come to think of it, wasn't Fuuka in the art club...?   
Happy - Maybe you should go check it out if you're interested. See how they operate and all that.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, Arisato-kun.   
I heard you joined the track team. They said you showed a lot of promise.   
Happy - I'm on the archery team, but let's both do our best, okay?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, Arisato-kun. Are you heading home?   
I thought you might like to know that the track team is recruiting new members.   
Happy - They have a pretty good rep from what I've heard. Maybe you should go take a look?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, what a coincidence. Are you here to shop too, Arisato-kun?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's right.   
I'm just wandering around.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - This mall is pretty convenient. You can buy almost anything here.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It's always a good idea to get more familiar with the city.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, hey, what are you doing here by yourself? Well, I'm by myself, too.   
Hanging out with friends is nice and all, but it's important to get some alone time, too.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, Arisato-kun...   
Exasperated* - Feels like summer is totally in full swing now... God, it's so hot.   
Summer school starts tomorrow, so I'm gonna spend what little time I've got left having fun!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It's almost May. Coordinating outfits is real tricky around this time.   
Like sometimes you think it'll be hot out, but then it suddenly gets cold.   
That's one reason uniforms are so convenient. Plus, adding a personal touch can be pretty fun, too.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Unused   
Very happy* - Koro-chan is so awesome! He was so brave that day! I don't know how he was trained, but he's amazing!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Another hot day... You could get heatstroke just standing outside for a little while.   
Exasperated* - I'd better hurry up and finish my shopping, so I can get home.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
So... have you finished all your homework already?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah.   
No.   
I lost it.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Wow, way to go! You're one responsible guy, Arisato-kun.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Yikes... We should really get it done soon. I still have a lot left, too...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - The teacher's not gonna buy that excuse, you know. You'll end up working on a new assignment after class...   
And if that happens, you won't be able to go to Tartarus. It's less trouble to take care of it now.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I'm gonna see a movie with my friend later. It just hit the theaters today.   
Sad - She's running late though. Hm, I wonder where she is...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I wanted to pick out a new swimsuit, but none of them caught my eye.   
Sad - I wonder why, though. It's not like the selection was bad or anything.   
Sad - Maybe I'm just not in the mood for shopping...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Unused   
It's hard to describe how... but have you noticed that Sanada-senpai acts a little different around Amada-kun?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Unused   
なんとなく・ぜんぜん   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Unused   
I wonder why... Maybe he doesn't get along with kids? He does seem a bit socially awkward.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Unused   
Do you just not notice that kind of stuff? Anyway, I wonder what it is... I've never seen him like that before.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Oh, Arisato-kun. Let me introduce you to Amada-kun.   
   
Ken Amada   
Nice to meet you. My name is Ken Amada.   
Are you friends with Yukari-san and Junpei-san?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Yep, you got it.   
Happy - He lives in the same dorm as me and Yuka-tan.   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - Really? I didn't know boys and girls could live in the same dorm.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Um, uhhh, well... It's like...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - We're exceptions! We've got good reasons for sticking close...   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Uh-huh...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I've been talking to Amada-kun here a lot lately.   
Happy - I'm surprised at how reliable he is. And he's so much more mature than Stupei.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, hey, Arisato-kun.   
   
Ken Amada   
Hello, Arisato-san.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I was just chatting with Amada-kun again. Did you come here to visit him, too?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's right.   
I'm here to see you, Yukari.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very happy* - Hey, isn't that great, Amada-kun? Arisato-kun wants to be your friend, too.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Thanks for coming to see me!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Me...? But we see each other at the dorm every day.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - There goes Stupei again, being a bad influence. He can be such a kid...   
But, you know, it's nice to do this sort of thing once in a while.   
Happy - Let's think positive thoughts and hope for the best.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...Are you heading home, Arisato-kun?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's walk home together.   
Yep. See you.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Um...   
Sad - N-No thanks. Maybe next time.   
Sad - Sorry... I guess I'm just not in the mood. I'm not sure how to explain it.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It seems like there's something   
on Yukari's mind...   
If I want her to open up to me,   
I need to work on my .   
If I were , she might be   
willing to talk to me about her problems...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, okay, see ya.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, Arisato-kun...   
Sad - ...Could we maybe take some time to talk?   
Sad - Um... In private?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It seems that, because of my ,   
Yukari thinks I look reliable.   
This might be my chance   
to get to know her better...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
So, uh... can we go to the rooftop?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure.   
I can't today.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Thanks, I wanted to talk to you.   
All right, let's go then.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, okay... Maybe some other time, then.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, Arisato-kun.   
Are you walking back by yourself? I'll come with you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It seems Yukari wants   
to walk home with me.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, Arisato-kun...   
Looking away - S-So about the other day...   
Sad - Sorry, um... Do you have some time right now? I'd like to talk things out with you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend some time   
after school with Yukari?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Spend time with her   
Check Social Link status   
Not now   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very happy* - Great! Let's go somewhere!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Th-Thanks...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Then, can we go to the rooftop?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - I-In that case...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very happy* - Do you... wanna come to my room?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Huh...? S-Sure, okay.   
Happy - Well... Wanna come to my room?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Oh, are you busy? Well, maybe some other time.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - ......   
Angry - Wh-What do you want?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - ...Again?   
Angry - If you've got something to say, then spit it out already.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's walk home together.   
I'm sorry.   
It was nothing.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Fine...   
I mean, I guess I was kinda harsh, too. Sorry for acting that way.   
Maybe we can go somewhere together like before...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The two of us made up!   
I should be able to invite her   
out the next time I'm free...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - ......   
Angry - I get the feeling you don't really mean it...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari still won't open up to me...   
I might have to try talking to her over a few   
days before I can mend our relationship.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - ...Oh really.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - ...I thought you had nothing to say.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, Arisato-kun.   
Happy - ...I'm okay now, thanks.   
Very happy* - I'm here for you too, so don't forget that, okay?   
......   
Sad - D-Don't stare at me...   
Sad - If someone sees us, they'll start spreading rumors.   
Looking away - ......   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel an unbreakable bond   
with Yukari...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Not Usedメッセージだよ。   
   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very happy* - Great, time for some window shopping! I wonder what's on display today.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, Arisato-kun.   
Happy - I'm okay now. I've got you and the rest of the team with me.   
Very happy* - And we're all here for you too. Don't forget that, okay?   
Sad - You're not actually keeping your problems bottled up, are you?   
Happy - If you ever need help, you can always count on us.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel an unbreakable bond   
with Yukari...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
By the way, are you heading home now?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - ...Could we maybe take some time to talk?   
Sad - Um... In private?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, by the way...   
Are you walking back by yourself? I'll come with you.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - H-Hey, about the other day...   
Sad - Sorry, um... Do you have some time right now? I'd like to talk things out with you.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, hey, Arisato-kun. Looks like we're finally done with exams.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - That's a load off our shoulders, huh?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very happy* - Man, I'm beat from all that studying, and I'm sure you are, too. Let's give ourselves a pat on the back.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Whew, we can finally relax now. Let's give ourselves a pat on the back and take a breather.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Great! Why don't we head somewhere fun?   
Happy - Oh, right... There's this place I wanted to check out.   
Very happy* - Help me pick out something nice, would you?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, Arisato-kun.   
Happy - If you're heading out, do you wanna stop by Paulownia Mall together on the way home?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Oh, hey! If you're leaving, do you wanna stop by Paulownia Mall together on the way home?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Okay, then let's get going.   
I wanna have a quick little shop trip first, then check out the music store...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, Arisato-kun.   
Happy - I was thinking of dropping by Paulownia Mall today. Wanna join me?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I was thinking of dropping by Paulownia Mall today. Wanna join me?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very happy* - Cool! Let's go!   
Happy - Was there anywhere you wanted to stop by? Maybe we could get some tea first, then go shopping after?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey there. You heading home now?   
Happy - I was thinking of swinging by the strip mall just now. Wanna join me?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, are you heading home now?   
Happy - I was thinking of swinging by the strip mall just now. Wanna join me?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very happy* - All right, let's get going then!   
I'm not really in the mood for ramen... What else can we get to eat?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - I'm finally done...   
Exasperated* - I spent all of lunch cleaning up for the archery team, so I didn't have time to eat anything.   
Exasperated* - Maybe I'll stop by Wakatsu or something on the way home...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - I felt so swamped with work today...   
Exasperated* - I spent all of lunch cleaning up for the archery team, so I didn't have time to eat anything.   
Exasperated* - Maybe I'll stop by Wakatsu or something on the way home...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very happy* - Haha, thanks. It feels kinda weird eating by myself, you know?   
Happy - All right, let's get going! Hmmm, what should I order...?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, hey there, Arisato-kun.   
Happy - Are you heading home? I was thinking of going out somewhere first.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - By the way, are you heading home? I was thinking of going out somewhere first.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Oh, you're coming, too? Great!   
Hm... Let's head to Paulownia Mall then. There were a few things I wanted to check out.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...Arisato-kun, are you heading home?   
Sad - Um... I was hoping that you had the time to talk right now.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh... Are you heading home?   
Sad - Um... I was hoping that you had the time to talk right now.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - ...Thanks.   
This isn't the best place for that though... Let's go to the roof.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh... Arisato-kun.   
Sad - Um... Are you busy right now?   
Surprised - It's nothing important, but... there's something I need to tell you.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Um... Are you busy right now?   
Surprised - It's nothing important, but... there's something I need to tell you.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Great, in that case...   
Let's go to the roof. Sorry, I'll try to make this quick.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very happy* - Oh, hey there.   
Happy - I'm about to head home. What about you?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very happy* - Oh, by the way, I'm about to head home. What about you?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Hey, what's up?   
Happy - I'm gonna stop by Paulownia Mall on the way home. Wanna join me?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Oh, right.   
Happy - I'm gonna stop by Paulownia Mall on the way home. Wanna join me?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, that's too bad. See you later, then.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, all right then. I'll see you later.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, are you busy? Maybe next time, then.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, bad timing, I guess. See you later, then.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - Oh, okay...   
Sad - Sorry, I guess it was pretty sudden. I'll see you later, then.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, that's too bad. Maybe next time.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, you already had plans? Maybe next time, then.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh... Maybe next time, then. I'll see you later.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Even though I gathered up the courage to invite you... Oh well, maybe next time.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, did you already have plans? Maybe next time, then.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, okay. I'll just see you at the dorm, then.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - Wh-What? I think we're done for today.   
Happy - ...Maybe some other time.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Okay, I'll see you at the dorm. Feel free to talk to me at any time.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - ...Here we are, on summer vacation, but I still have to deal with Junpei's usual antics.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, have you seen Kirijo-senpai? Maybe she's still in her room...   
She's been acting like... a shadow of her former self. It's as if she's become a different person.   
I get what she's going through, but... I can't bear to see her like this.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
There's little we can do.   
I'm worried about her.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I guess you're right... There's no point in venting to you either.   
Maybe... I should go talk to her.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, same. You can't help but worry...   
I guess... I should go talk to her.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I made a promise with Mitsuru-senpai...   
...That we would get rid of the Dark Hour together.

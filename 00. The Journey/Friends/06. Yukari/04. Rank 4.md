Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Let's see... I'd like to stop by the drug store before we head home. Do you mind? It'll just be a little longer.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hang on, I've got a phone call.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - Oh...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...Hello.   
Yeah... What?   
Angry - ...So? Get to the point already.   
Sad - Huh?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
[cut 2 2 1]   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very angry* - That's not funny!   
Very angry* - What!? How do you think that would make Dad feel?   
Angry - ......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Fine. Do whatever you want.   
Angry - Just don't call me again!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - ......   
Looking away - Sorry.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Who was that?   
What was that about?   
Are you okay?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - That was... Um...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - It was my mom.   
Looking away - She said she wants to get remarried.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Very angry* - None of your business!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Sorry. Um...   
Sad - My mom... She's saying she wants to get remarried.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Oh, yeah... I'm fine. Thanks for asking.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You know who I was on the phone with, right...? Yeah, it was my mom.   
She says she wants to get remarried...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I don't really care if she wants to get married again. What I can't stand is how she chose to live her life.   
Looking away - Running away from things, jumping from guy to guy...   
Looking away - I don't think that's fair to my dad.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari seems pretty upset.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I quietly stood by her side   
until she calmed down...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Sorry. I'm okay now.   
Really. Thanks.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - I'll never be like her. I'll never give up standing on my own two feet...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Running away from your problems by clinging onto others is the worst thing you can do.   
Angry - I've decided I'll make it through on my own.   
Angry - I'll show her that I can be happy that way.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yukari has shared her innermost feelings.   
I understand her a little better now...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Thanks for listening.   
Happy - For some reason, I feel like I can tell you anything, Arisato-kun...   
Happy - Let's head back now. I'll do the rest of my shopping some other day.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I left the mall and went back to the dorm...

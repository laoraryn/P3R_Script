Akihiko Sanada   
Oh, did you need something from the police station, too?   
I just finished saying hi to Kurosawa-san. Took a look at some weapons while I was there.   
I know you're in charge of our equipment, but it doesn't hurt to check out what's in stock every now and then, you know?   
Happy - Well, I'm looking forward to seeing a new haul of equipment.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - I'm in great condition.   
Happy - All I need is some equipment to match, and I can't lose.   
   
---   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
By the way, Officer Kurosawa can't experience the Dark Hour; he's just an ordinary policeman.   
But he knows what we do—at least in a broad sense—and helps out where he can.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Why does he help us?   
How did you meet him?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well, I don't know how he knows about our situation, but regardless...   
He seems to be simply following his own convictions and doing what he thinks is right.   
Happy - He's a good man. You should be glad to have him on our side.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well... He helped me out a while ago.   
Trust me, he's someone you can count on.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You can rely on Officer Kurosawa to provide good equipment. Just remember to get it from him.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
The doctor told me to rest, but I don't want to risk losing my edge.   
I was thinking that getting back into training could be a good way to rehabilitate, but...   
If Mitsuru finds out, being told to rest will be the least of my worries.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
*sigh* I wish I could at least get back to training for the boxing team after school...   
Oh, speaking of after-school activities, I heard you joined a club.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - You better give it your best, all right?   
Happy - It might be hard to participate regularly, but it'll be worth it if you can find the time for it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
*sigh* I wish I could at least get back to training for the boxing team after school...   
Oh, speaking of after-school activities, have you thought about joining any clubs?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
A lot of clubs won't accept new members partway through your second year.   
But I recommend looking for any ones that do.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
They say it'll still be some time before my injuries fully heal.   
*sigh* Well, I hope I can get back to fighting sooner rather than later. Guess we'll see...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
What's up? Are you going out?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, I'm about to.   
Nah, I'm staying in.   
What about you?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Well, what're you standing around here for? Go have some fun.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well, it's your time to spend.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
No, I'm being "well-behaved" today.   
I can't do much with my injury, but I don't have anything in particular to take care of anyway.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hey, don't worry about me. Go spend your time however you want.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
So, I heard Mitsuru asked you to join student council.   
Sorry if it feels like you're being forced to, but I'm sure she could really use your help.   
Well, anyway, it's ultimately up to you, so give it some thought.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Tons of people all playing the same game together...   
And it's online, right? I imagine that makes it even harder to know who you're playing.   
I guess not knowing your enemies makes it easier, in some respects.   
As for me, I prefer to look my opponent straight in the face before we compete.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Let me tell you something.   
In both boxing and actual combat, speed is key.   
Whether you're landing an attack or evading one, you won't succeed if you can't move quickly.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'm sure you're tired of hearing this, but make sure you're fully prepared before going to Tartarus.   
You never know what'll happen there.   
There are some aspects to battle that we simply can't manage with an unprepared leader.   
I'm sure you don't want to put everyone else in danger, so keep that in mind.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well, it's just about Golden Week...   
I was looking forward to improving on past years' Golden Week training regimen.   
But I guess that won't be happening this year...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Maybe taking a day to do nothing once in a while isn't so bad.   
If nothing else, I've learned some new ways to kill time.   
That said, this is just one day. I don't know about spending multiple days in a row like this...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I feel like I'm doing all right enough at this point that I can at least do some light exercise.   
Happy - But as long as Mitsuru's watching me, I can't even do a single squat.   
She hardly even trusts me to go to the restroom without trying to sneak in some training.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If you're looking for Mitsuru, she's in the command room, training her detection skills.   
But she says you can still let her know if you want to head to Tartarus tonight.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I get the urge to do some boxing practice whenever I'm at school.   
Maybe I should just get back to it when I feel like I've gotten better? What do you think, Arisato?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
No way.   
I guess you could.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I was joking, I was joking! Don't give me that face.   
And anyway, even if you approved of it, there's no way Mitsuru would, too.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Oh, you think so? Well, I was just joking.   
If I did something like that, there's no way Mitsuru would keep a lid on it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - You probably think I'm making a big deal out of nothing, but this downtime is driving me nuts.   
Seriously, why do bones take so long to heal...?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
As Mitsuru says, this quiet is certainly odd.   
I have a feeling something big is on its way... Arisato, get as ready as you can.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Oh yeah, Junpei was whining about weapons being so expensive earlier...   
But if you've got something you don't use, Kurosawa-san might buy it off you, if you ask.   
Well, it's not like he buys everything, but if you're low on cash, you should hit him up.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - Well done yesterday. Also... sorry.   
Sad - If I had gone, you never would've been exposed to such danger, but...   
It's frustrating, but there's nothing I can do now but bear it. I'll definitely be back within the month, though.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's fine to take a breather every so often, but don't forget about Tartarus.   
Although, it won't be too late if you wait until after I return. I'll leave that up to you.   
Happy - I don't mind if you go without me, but I'd definitely appreciate the opportunity to show my stuff.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Whatever the battle, it's always important to face it with a level head.   
However, there are also opponents who'll try to play mind games with you...   
Shadows may look mindless at times, but you absolutely can't take them lightly.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hey, not that you were thinking of pulling one or anything...   
But all-nighters are completely pointless.   
Whether it's training or studying, daily practice is what really provides results.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That Junpei... Will he be all right come exam time?   
Every time I'm in here during a study break, he's here too...   
But, I don't think he ever leaves... That's quite a break he's taking.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's a bummer how Yamagishi can't join us in fights, but don't worry, I'll be back in no time.   
Or... did you want to team up with her instead of me?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Don't be crazy...   
......   
If I'm being honest, yes.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Really? Because Junpei was pretty down when he heard she wouldn't be going with us...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You don't have to answer that... Are you really that worried about how I'd respond, though?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Haha! Honest, aren't you? Although, the situation isn't changing any, so you might as well give up that hope.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
To really get my feel for battle back, a trip or two to Tartarus won't cut it...   
I feel like I'm gonna want to go every day.   
Well, if you're going tonight, give me a shout. I'm raring to go.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - My scores on this latest round of exams were quite a bit higher than usual.   
I guess it's only natural, considering how I used my training time to study instead.   
Oh, right—Mitsuru told me she'll be back late tonight...   
So, according to her, Tartarus is a no-go.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Kurosawa-san deals in a variety of weapons for us...   
But my weapons? I've always got 'em on me, heh...   
Happy - I dive right into the fray and dish out the pain... These might not be as flashy as some of your weapons, but they're my pride and joy.   
Just tell me if you ever wanna fight with your fists too—I'll whip up a solid training regimen for you.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
In my eyes, Tartarus is the best place we can find for training the mind and body.   
Although I do understand Mitsuru's concerns about the place... Is there even a top floor to that thing?   
If so, what's at the top...? Oof, just thinking about it gives me the shivers.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Our efforts probably won't be appreciated by the people in town...   
But if we don't fight, then the city'll eventually be overrun with the Lost.   
That's why we need to enjoy the peace and quiet whenever we find it—that's the result of our hard work.   
Make sure you don't forget that.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...Even so, the Lost are more prevalent than ever right now...   
They may go away for a bit after we beat a Shadow, but that sure doesn't last long.   
I guess we really have to clean house in Tartarus to take care of the issue for good, huh?   
Well, running our mouths about it won't do us any good. For now, all I can do is train properly.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Apparently, Tartarus is off-limits today.   
Mitsuru's in training, and Takeba "has a bad feeling" right now...   
Sheesh... Could she be any more mysterious about it?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If you're looking for Mitsuru, she's in the back of the reception area.   
Apparently, she's uploading the dorm's records or something to the school server. She's gotta do it every so often.   
I know it's her job, but still... She's really got a lot on her plate.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Takeba seems pretty serious...   
Well, it's good to be that invested in things.   
If you're free, how about lending her a hand?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well, good luck.   
Whatever the reality is, this definitely sounds like it'll be interesting.   
Happy - I'm looking forward to the results.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
The level of gossip at school is getting pretty out of hand...   
Today, there were three girls going on and on about a certain rumor...   
Sad - I really hope this gets taken care of sooner rather than later.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Man, is Takeba something...   
Don't you get tired of these rumors?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I sure do.   
I can live with it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah, that's what I thought. Well, good luck with your research.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Ooh, aren't you the tough one? Well, good luck anyway.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Where there's smoke, there's fire... I'm interested in finding out the truth too. Good luck there.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
What are you planning this time? Don't do anything too crazy...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Seriously—going to a place like that, there are limits to how reckless you can be.   
I mean, I'm proud of you guys for trying to gather information, but be a little more careful next time.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hm? What is it? If you're looking for Mitsuru and Takeba, they're on the third floor.   
It sounds like they're getting Yamagishi's room ready, so I doubt we'd be of much use.   
Unless, like... they find a cockroach or something.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Originally, Yamagishi was supposed to move in on Sunday...   
But the plans got pushed forward at her request.   
Happy - I'm glad she's so motivated. I'd better make sure I'm at the top of my game.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
An enemy that only appears on a full moon...   
Maybe I should reorganize my training regimen while I still have the time.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'm sure you're already feeling it, but the enemies are steadily growing more powerful.   
Don't be satisfied with how you are now—work on improving your strength. If you wait until after a tough battle, it'll be too late.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'm sure you're already feeling it, but the enemies are steadily growing more powerful.   
Don't be satisfied with how you are now—work on improving your strength. If you wait until after a tough battle, it'll be too late.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
No matter the battle, a proper balance is key to winning.   
Not just power—mental strength, agility, and some luck, too.   
It's not easy to train up each aspect, but if you keep experiencing what life has to offer, you'll get the training along the way.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It really does seem like the Shadows are progressively getting stronger...   
Although, that's not something to be too concerned about.   
If we put in enough effort, we'll win. If we don't, then we lose. Pretty simple stuff.   
That means there's nothing for us to do right now but keep climbing Tartarus and building up our strength.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You always seem so... unbothered.   
Do you just have no regrets or something?   
Ah, sorry. I was just curious—I didn't mean anything by it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Stories about the Lost have really picked up at school...   
My guess is that there's a Shadow making its move out there.   
Happy - I guess our full moon theory was right. Hm, things are getting even more interesting...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I know Mitsuru said it already, but it'll be a full moon in just a week.   
Once you think about our timeframe, the tension really starts rising, doesn't it?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Our next battle may be drawing near, but don't get too nervous.   
If you do, you might find yourself freezing up.   
Try and stay as relaxed as you can.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
So, full moon's nearly here...   
Heh, things are about to get exciting... I can't wait to see what we're taking on.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Two days left... Don't slack on your training until the last minute, okay?   
I know people sometimes feel like they've hit their limit...   
But for most people, that's just an excuse. In reality, they've just given up.   
No matter how much you're suffering, pushing through it is the only path to real progress.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Mitsuru's not here, so we're skipping Tartarus tonight.   
Just take it easy for now.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You're really making a name for yourself as our leader.   
Especially with this latest operation—excellent commanding there.   
Next time, the enemies will probably get stronger again, but if you keep up the effort, I know you'll do fine.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I gotta say, I didn't expect Ikutsuki-san to come bearing good news.   
I figured he was here just to share more of his lame jokes...   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - Hahaha... Well, this isn't the time for that.   
Happy - I am happy to see everyone with smiles on their faces, though.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - Amada's going to live here...   
Sad - ...with us.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
A lot of people are joining the team, huh...?   
Big difference from a while back.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
So, it's finally summer vacation...   
I have to change up my training when these longer vacations pop up.   
Care to join in? It'd make the summer extra worthwhile...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Just one little kid, stuck living with a bunch of high schoolers... Well, I suppose it's not the worst thing to happen.   
Arisato, try to make an effort being nice to the kid.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'm not saying it's bad or anything...   
But when you've got a little kid staring at you, it can be kinda awkward.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Koromaru... That is one tough customer, huh?   
He protected what he needed to...   
Sad - What a good little guy.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Since it's the day before the competition, don't go overdoing any last-minute training.   
You could end up matched with that Hayase guy...   
Happy - Give your body some time to relax today so you can face the challenge in your best condition.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Placing in the top rank of a team that you just started in... Well done.   
Wish we could go take on some full moon Shadows while you're still in the zone.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Junpei is in quite high spirits, huh?   
Maybe he just doesn't want to lose to Koromaru... Well, I certainly understand that feeling.   
I don't like the idea of some dog swooping in and hogging all our glory.   
If you're heading to Tartarus, I'll join you. I wanna go wild tonight.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Training during this season is really exhausting...   
I'd like to wring a bit more range of movement out of my body, but maybe I should stop and rethink my pacing.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Why go that far?   
Maybe chill out for the summer.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...To become even stronger.   
After all, the Shadows are getting tougher.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Don't be stupid.   
The Shadows are getting tougher, no matter what we do. There's no time to rest.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I get the sense that there's quite a bit going on behind the scenes, but... the idea is simple enough.   
Their goal and ours have crossed...   
But the next time they get in our way, we'll take them down. That's all there is to it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sports and school work the same.   
No matter how strong you are, those who don't put in the effort fail.   
It's the same with school. If you don't study, you won't pass your tests.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Oh right, today was the summer festival.   
Me and Mitsuru, we're not really good at that sort of stuff...   
But if you're interested, don't worry about us—go have a good time.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Apparently, Tartarus is a no-go today.   
Aigis dragged Mitsuru to the summer festival...   
Happy - Man, Aigis's restraint technique is amazing. Now there's an anti-Shadow weapon for you.   
Happy - Although, I did just realize, she's probably in a lot of trouble for that, too. I wonder what they're up to right now...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Speaking of Koromaru's meals—sometimes, he looks like he wants to eat a beef bowl...   
But I guess it'd be better to just give him dog food.   
I know there are some foods that are dangerous to dogs, and it's not like he needs the stuff for his diet, right?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Junpei's not around again, huh?   
I've never seen that guy do any homework... Is he gonna be all right?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It certainly is hot, this place...   
Even outside of training, this is a temperature where if you don't make sure you hydrate, you'll collapse...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It sounds like we're able to go to Tartarus tonight...   
But Mitsuru says she's going to pass. Some kinda business she has to take care of, I guess.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That Junpei, talking nonsense again...   
Did the heat finally finish off his final brain cells? Eh, I guess I'll just leave him alone.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's finally the end of August.   
Once school starts back up again, you won't have much time for anything else.   
If you have anything you need to do, you'd better take care of it now.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Just because it's hot out doesn't make it a reason to skip training.   
So, for Tartarus—if you're going to go, give me a shout, all right?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If you ask me, it's just like Ikutsuki-san said—Amada has a strong will.   
Even if he's just a kid, I guess his determination is the real deal...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Ah, about Amada...   
Would you mind looking after him? For me?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure.   
I don't really want to...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Good. I'm counting on you.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'm asking you, please?   
Sad - I'm not very good at that kinda stuff...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'll leave Amada to you. I think you'll handle things with him well.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I had nothing to do with this, all right? It was all Mitsuru.   
If anything happens at school, I'm not gonna be held responsible for it.   
Sad - *sigh* What is Ikutsuki-san thinking?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - At this point, there's nothing left to say about the group's fighting strength...   
Happy - But yours hasn't dulled, right? Heh, I'm already excited for the next full moon.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Geez. You're the same as always...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
The full moon's close. Make sure you've got our plan of attack hammered out.   
If you're not set yet, you should rely on Shinji for the time being.   
Happy - He's got a pretty strong arm, this guy.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Huh? Ah, don't listen to him. I'm nothing special.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well, tomorrow probably won't be an easy fight...   
But that's fine. I prefer when they make me sweat a bit.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We probably won't be going to the hospital again, huh?   
It seems like that Chidori person wasn't all that compatible with us...   
Except for one person.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Tell me, what do you personally think of Shinji?   
I know how he can come across, but he's not a bad guy. Yeah, he can be a nag, but still...   
Well, feel free to put him to work on the team.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We've got three Shadows remaining, huh?   
Phew... Just thinking that makes my body tense up. Maybe I'll beef up my training a bit.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Now we've got a typhoon headed our way...   
Still not sure if it's going to lay us out or not, though...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
This building was damaged by that Shadow back in April.   
I wonder if there are any leaks...   
I hope this place didn't get damaged as badly as I did, heh...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Is your body totally healed up?   
The physical health of a fighter is very important... Be careful.   
Happy - No matter how strong you are, if you don't feel well, you won't last long in the ring.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Mitsuru is saying all that, but we only have three Shadows left.   
Once we defeat them, there won't be any more news about the Lost...   
We just have to give our best for a bit longer.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Welp, that time's coming around once again.   
After a few more full moons, we'll have eliminated them all... It's almost disappointing.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
There's still a bit of time until Sunday.   
But I won't lecture you on how to spend your time anymore. I'm sure you've got your own approach at this point.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I wonder how many Shadows there'll be this time.   
At most, I think there'll be two...   
But, if it's two powerful ones, it's going to be a tough fight...   
How about we spend our last bit of time before that on some strength training?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
*sigh* Nothing lasts forever, huh?   
...Shinji was satisfied. He got out while he was ahead.   
Let him rest in peace. We should be focusing on what we need to do now.   
There's less than a week until midterms...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You've got the face of someone who can't focus on their schoolwork right now.   
I definitely know how you feel...   
But still, make sure you do what you've got to do. I mean, if he saw how you're acting, he'd get upset.   
For now, just focus on your studies. All right?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
One more Shadow left... A lot's happened, but the next one is the last.   
We've finally made it. For us, there's nothing left except winning.   
Try to keep it together, all right?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Every time I come in here, Junpei's here too.   
He'll always tell me, "I'm takin' a break too" or something, but... how much rest does the guy need?   
I mean, for it to be called a break, you have to actually do something else to take a break from it...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Uh... We just happened to be taking our breaks at the same time, Sanada-san!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Now that we're done with exams, I can finally put all my focus on training.   
First, I need to increase my weekly workouts...   
If I don't keep pushing myself, I just won't feel like I'm being as useful as possible.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Is the machine in the command room still acting up?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yes, it hasn't been repaired yet.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
So we don't know the cause? Then, how'll we ever fix it...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'll check it out later. If you have time for it, could you check it too, Arisato-kun?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
How were your results for the exams? Mine were the usual.   
Well, we can't be wasting time worrying about exam results right now...   
Happy - Our priority should be to train as much as we can for the final battle.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - I made some changes to my training regimen recently...   
Happy - I'd heard that imagining someone watching your back while you work out is supposed to be effective.   
Happy - I had my doubts at first, but turns out, it works pretty well.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
This theory applies to sports tournaments as well...   
When a person is made aware that the next match will be their last one, there are two types of responses.   
One: they get nervous and stiffen up, preventing them from displaying their true capabilities. Two: they get even more fired up.   
Happy - Needless to say, I'm the second type. Sometimes I even get fired up while I'm just training.   
Happy - Well, my point is, the more you train, the more you'll clearly recognize when victory is within your grasp.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We don't have many opportunities left to go to Tartarus.   
It'd make sense if I beefed up my own training so I could take full advantage of each Tartarus visit...   
All right, I'm going to start planning it out now.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Mitsuru says we'll probably come across Strega in the next battle.   
Personally, I hope we do...   
I've got some payback to deliver.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Mitsuru says we'll probably come across Strega in the next battle.   
Personally, I hope we do...   
I'm gonna wreck them for what they did to Shinji.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - As you already know, Mitsuru's a very strong person...   
Sad - But this is just too huge...   
Sad - ......   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Mitsuru will be gone a little bit longer.   
Sad - There's so much she has to deal with on her own now...   
Sad - I wish there was more I could do for her.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - Mitsuru's back, but like anyone would expect...   
Sad - I'm sure there's nothing we can say to actually make her feel better.   
Sad - All we can do is let time heal her wounds.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
So, we're back on track for Tartarus again, huh?   
I know she'd prefer we weren't so considerate towards her...   
Sad - But still, look out for her, will ya?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - Mitsuru's still not 100% yet, and I don't know what we should be doing...   
Sad - Dammit... How long is this situation gonna last?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Mitsuru finally decided to go on the school trip too.   
I was really worried she wouldn't, so that's one piece of good news.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You guys need to grow up more. If we'd gotten caught...   
Sad - ......   
We would've experienced hell on earth...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'll just say this: the main offenders were Junpei and Mochizuki.   
Sad - We were forced to do it against our will! We're victims too here.   
Sad - ......   
Sad - Could you just leave me alone now...?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Boring work, huh?   
Well, too bad... That's what a job's like.   
It's fine to complain, but just make sure you finish what you're supposed to do, too.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
How's Junpei holding up?   
I'm sure he knows what he has to do...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
He knows what he needs to do...   
He's just afraid to do it.   
He just needs something to push him into taking that first step...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Heh... Now that's the Junpei I know.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Junpei's got his smile back.   
Happy - It's good to see the classic Junpei in action again.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Mochizuki asked Mitsuru out...? Heh, I'm surprised he's still alive.   
I used to think he was all talk. I guess he's got guts of his own...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - An unavoidable end...?   
Sad - This can't be happening! I won't accept it...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We have to stay calm.   
If we panic, we won't be able to make the right choice. First, we should go over all the information we have...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
The Shadows' purpose...   
What's the Appriser?   
Who is Nyx?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Shadows are pieces of Nyx...   
And their sole reason of existence is to revive her.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
The Appriser is the one who summons Nyx.   
The appearance of the Appriser is a sign that the Fall is near...   
And all humans will become members of the Lost.   
...I guess everything that's happening right now is just the beginning.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
According to Mochizuki, it was Nyx who brought the concept of death to this planet.   
Nyx will turn every human being into a member of the Lost...   
And because the Lost cannot survive without someone taking care of them, everyone will die.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Thinking about it isn't going to change anything...   
So I'm going to train.   
That's all I can do at this point.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - I can't seem to calm down.   
Sad - Dammit... What can we do?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You make a schedule so you can achieve a goal...   
But without a future... a training schedule is pointless.   
Sad - Dammit! I don't know what to do...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
What would he do at a time like this...?   
......   
He'd probably fight the end of the world with all he had...   
Yeah, that's what he would do.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah, she said we should just act like everything is normal...   
But that probably refers to keeping our emotions in check. It doesn't mean you don't have to study for exams if you normally don't.   
You'll be fine though, won't you?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Of course.   
Not really...   
What about you?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Well, that's good.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - I understand how you feel, but just try to focus on what's right in front of you for now.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Oh, I'm good to go. I've gotten in the habit of studying every day.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's about time for the Christmas mood to start setting in...   
Let's try to have some fun, huh?   
After all, we don't know if we'll live to see next Christmas...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I wonder what Mochizuki is doing right now...   
Maybe he's cursing fate. Why does he even care about life on earth?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - I don't really wanna think about it...   
Sad - No matter what we do, we can't stop it from happening.   
Sad - It's just not fair...   
   
Koromaru   
Sad - *whine*   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - I wish I could just forget about it, too...   
But the Promised Day will eventually come—there's no escaping it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Oh, I was just thinking about something...   
Now that our exams are done, I can't stop thinking about the decision we have to make.   
This is even harder than studying for exams...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Oh, there's no school tomorrow, huh?   
I'm not really doing anything. What about you?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I have plans.   
Same here.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Oh yeah?   
Happy - Well, we don't get many days off, so spend them wisely.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Is that right? It's nice to just relax once in a while, huh?   
Well, make sure you spend the time wisely.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's totally up to you how to spend your time. Just try to make it worthwhile.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hey, did you know...   
That the moment you meet eyes with your opponent, the fight's begun?   
And the first one to look away loses.   
That's why I'm not going to look away anymore. I'm going to stare right into Nyx's eyes...   
Angry - ...and defeat it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's going to be winter vacation soon...   
Have you decided what you're going to tell him yet?   
Wait, don't tell me now. I want to hear it when the day comes.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's finally winter vacation.   
I wonder what we'll be doing once it's over...   
Whatever it is, I hope we won't regret it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's time for our decision...   
It kinda feels like when I'm stepping into the ring before a match...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Heh, looks like we're gonna be facing Nyx head on...   
Well, I say bring it. I'm going to give this everything I've got.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
After all that's happened...   
Happy - It's good to be starting a new year.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
"If you believe, you will be saved"...   
Tch... What a joke.   
Who would buy that line?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
"Mysterious cases"... That's all they're talking about on the news.   
Up until now, the reports on Shadow incidents had been altered before being publicized, right?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yes, that goes the same for the victims. The public receives a watered-down version of the truth.   
If a person is found unconscious, it's framed as a mugging. If a person goes missing, it's reported as a kidnapping. That's how they've been handled.   
However, the problem is that these incidents are sporadic, and the culprits are never identified...   
In the end, they're classified as mysterious cases because everything about them is unexplainable.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hmm... So it's the sheer number of cases that's arousing suspicion...   
Things are getting pretty serious...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Everyone at school thinks this is just a normal third term.   
They have no clue that this may be their last third term ever.   
I don't know how to feel...   
Even though we're in the same classroom, it feels like we're living in different worlds...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Even if I wasn't in SEES, I still wouldn't join the cult.   
How about you? Do you think you'd ever fall down that rabbit hole?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
No way.   
I might.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Heh, that's what I thought you'd say.   
The cult can't influence those who are true to themselves.   
Boxing helped me find my true self, and it seems like you have your own activities to keep you focused.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hmm. Sounds like you might need to do some introspection. Can't give the cult any chance to root itself in you.   
Boxing helped me to face myself. Maybe you could find an activity to help you find your true self, too.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Facing yourself and having strong values will help free you from a cult's deceptions.   
I wish those who have been deceived could do that.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Studying for the college entrance exams got me thinking about where my life's going.   
So, I'll say this again...   
We've all got our futures ahead of us, and we're not going to let Nyx stand in our way.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - For me and Shinji, our goal was to find a way to rid the world of the Dark Hour.   
Sad - And now, he's passed the torch on to us to fulfill that goal...   
I'm gonna put an end to this, whatever it takes.   
   
Ken Amada   
Yeah... For Aragaki-san's sake...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Don't you worry, Sanada-san! We're gonna kick Nyx's ass!   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Oh yeah? Then I'll hold you to your word.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I've been thinking that we should start incorporating more nutritious meals into Koromaru's eating regimen.   
How about horse meat? I hear it helps relieve fatigue, and it's high in protein.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sounds good.   
That's over the top.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf arf!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Sounds like he agrees.   
He's gonna need his strength for the battle ahead.   
   
Koromaru   
Sad - *whine*   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You think? He's gonna need all the energy he can get.   
Dogs don't have the luxury of choosing what they eat. We should at least provide him with something tasty.   
And, considering the circumstances, I don't think it'd be asking too much to splurge on a nice meal for him.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Now Junpei's got all the more reason to give it his all. No way he'll let us lose.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Your career consultation is next week, right?   
I've got no advice for you. This is something you're gonna have to figure out on your own.   
If you let someone else tell you what to do with your life, you might end up resenting that person if things go south.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Only one more week...   
All things considered, this bears repeating.   
**Once we enter Tartarus on the 31st, there's no going back.**   
Spend this time wisely. Can't leap into the unknown with unfinished business, now, can we?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
The future is like train tracks...   
And defeating Nyx may be our next stop, but it's not our ultimate destination.   
It's up to us to figure out what that'll be.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You've probably had this thought already, but after all this is over, SEES won't be needed anymore.   
Happy - It's hard to wrap my head around it...   
I guess it's too soon to get emotional over it. Better to spend that energy focusing on defeating Nyx.   
Well, why don't we go to Tartarus and train? Can't be too prepared.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Ramen, eh? Good choice.   
Happy - A fighter needs their energy if they're gonna go all out in battle.   
Happy - And it doesn't hurt to share a meal that's so full of precious memories...   
Happy - Well, eat up! Don't want you going into tonight's battle on an empty stomach.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Here we are. It all ends tonight.   
Happy - Don't look so worried. We're going to win.   
And Shinji will be fighting alongside us tonight... I can feel it.   
   
---   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Ah, Arisato.   
You look bored. Not that I can claim any different...   
I actually want to switch up my workout plan, but the heat is killing me...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Sanada seems bored...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I invite Sanada to the film festival?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Invite to the movies   
Don't invite   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You look bored. Did you finish your homework?   
...Well, you're one up on Junpei.   
Happy - All right...   
Happy - The film festival, huh? I didn't know about it till Junpei told me.   
Happy - C'mon, let's go.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Arisato, do you have any ideas for my new workout plan?   
I need to figure out a way to dish out punches like the ones in the movie...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Sanada is thinking hard...   
I should leave him alone.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I changed my workout plan. This one should keep me from being bored for a while.   
Let's see... According to the new plan, I have to...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Sanada seems busy... I doubt he's   
in the mood to go to the movies.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Summer vacation's going to be over pretty soon.   
Once school starts back up again, you won't have much time for anything else.   
So, if there's something you want to do, you should do it while you're still on break.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If you ask me, it's just like Ikutsuki-san said—Amada has a strong will.   
A kid's resolve can be much stronger than an adult's...   
Sad - ......   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Sanada is lost in thought...   
I doubt he's in the mood   
to go to the movies...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Right now, the Temperance Arcana   
may help me grow even more...

Akihiko Sanada   
Oh, hey, Arisato.   
   
DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_5_0   
Come to think of it, Elizabeth asked   
me to get a specific item for her...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...You want some protein?   
Gonna start bodybuilding, eh?   
Heh, I'm proud of you. I can give you something meant for beginners.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Here, it's called Amateur Protein.   
Happy - It's specially formulated for people like you.   
   
---   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...I'm glad everyone's having fun out there.   
Our operations during the Dark Hour are taxing on both mind and body. You should relax a little, rest up.   
If you need to take a break, the best spot to kick back is underneath the parasol.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
The way she just darted off is odd... I'm not sure what you said to her, but you better clear up the misunderstanding.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Honestly, staying at an inn like this doesn't feel much different from our everyday dorm life.   
I think I'll just head to bed. Hopefully my run tomorrow proves to be more exciting.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It seems like Mitsuru's overcome her pain.   
I don't know what happened, but I'm relieved to see that she's feeling better.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Junpei was looking for you downstairs.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hm... Come to think of it, isn't this the first time we've all gone to the baths together?

Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Right now, the Temperance Arcana   
may help me grow even more...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yo, Arisato.   
Did you see my text message? Wanna go grab a bite?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Sanada has invited me to join him.   
This might be a good opportunity   
to get to know him better.   
Should I spend the evening with Sanada?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Oh, Arisato. If you've got time, wanna get some food now?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts

Minato Arisato - Selection   
Spend time with Sanada   
Not now   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Great! Let's go.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All right. I guess it is pretty late already.   
Lately, I'm only free at night... Let me know when you have some time to hang out.   
   
-----   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I've gotten a lot of my edge back since I've been able to focus on my training.   
Happy - I've been meaning to thank you for that. You've really stepped up as our leader.   
Happy - So tonight's on me. You've got enough responsibility as it is.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I can handle it.   
I'm barely getting by.   
Good, I'm starving.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Hahaha, you really are something else. I knew I had a good feeling about you.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Really? I'd say you're doing great. As long as you make sure to get plenty of food and rest, too.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Heh, so you've got talent and an appetite. I think you'd make a pretty good athlete.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Just don't push yourself too hard. Things'll get easier with experience.   
And if you need anything, let me know. I'll do whatever I can to help.   
   
Young Woman's Voice   
Excuse me...!   
   
Excited Fan   
Ah, I knew it! You're Sanada-san, from Gekkoukan High!   
I heard you lived in Iwatodai, but wow, I never thought I'd run into you here!   
   
Noisy Fan   
We're big fans of yours! Please, can we get a picture with you!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...I'm busy. A-And I don't like having my picture taken.   
   
Excited Fan   
I kept hearing rumors that you were injured. Are you okay now?   
   
Noisy Fan   
Do you need any help? Is there anything I can bring you?   
   
Passing Woman   
Ooh, who do you think that is?   
   
Intrigued Man   
Not sure. A celebrity maybe? Wanna go see?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - ......   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Let's go, Arisato.   
   
Excited Fan (SE)   
Wait, Sanada-saaan!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - ...I've had this problem at school, but I didn't think it'd happen out here, too.   
Sad - It's probably because of those interviews, or the rumors online. I've gotten all kinds of attention as I've kept up my winning streak.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sounds rough.   
I'm jealous.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You can say that again. I'm not some panda in a zoo for everyone to gawk at.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - I've heard Junpei say that, but I wasn't expecting it from you, too.   
Well, I appreciate their support, but I don't have time for them right now.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All I want is to be as strong as I can. I wanna train hard and feel real pride in my strength.   
Sad - ...But all I ever seem to get is more trouble.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All right, looks like they've given up.   
Let's head out to eat, for real this time. We only have so many hours left in the day.

Unfriendly Man   
...Hey, don't be like that. I know a place that'd be perfect for us, girl.   
   
Fan from Earlier   
Please, just leave us alone! We're not interested.   
   
Man Showing Off   
One drink, that's all we're askin'. C'mon, it'll be fun.   
   
Scared Fan   
We said no, okay!?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's those girls from earlier.   
Are they being hit on...?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - ......   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - ...Hey.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Leave them alone. You don't want the police to get involved, do you?   
   
Unfriendly Man   
Huh? Who the hell're you?   
   
Man Showing Off   
What, you wanna call the cops? Quit tryin' to act like a big man, you little punk.   
   
Unfriendly Man   
Yeah, it's time for you to piss off!   
   
Man Showing Off   
You piece of—!   
   
Tough Guy   
...Hold up.   
   
Tough Guy   
You got some slick moves. I bet you know how to fight, that right?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - So what if I do?   
   
Tough Guy   
How about you and I go a few rounds? If ya ain't too busy, there's a spot around back.   
   
Tough Guy   
Whenever I see guys who think they're hot shit, all I wanna do is put 'em in their place.   
I bet a lotta people call you a tough guy, so how 'bout we put it to the test?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - ......   
   
Lackey   
What, is he scared now? Hahahaha!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...See? I told you—nothing but trouble.   
Angry - Stay here. I'll be done in a minute.   
   
Tough Guy   
What!? You think you're gonna beat me just like that!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Don't worry, I won't go all out against an amateur. It's gotta be a fair fight.   
   
Tough Guy   
Agh...!   
   
Voice from Police Car   
Hey, over there! Break it up!   
   
Tough Guy   
...Tch. Let's beat it!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - ...I told you, officer. They were the ones antagonizing us.   
   
Young Officer   
And I told you, we'll hear all about it down at the station.   
   
Middle-Aged Officer   
You're high school students, aren't you? We'll need your contact information to notify your parents about this.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
If I could butt in...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Kurosawa-san!   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
I'll handle these two. I've already cleared it with the brass.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
...I don't know what's going on here, but you better not be starting any trouble.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
There was no trouble.   
It wasn't our fault.   
That was a close call.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
Then why'd we get a report from two ladies saying you were attacked by a group of punks?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
They wanted to test my strength. I was just giving them what they wanted.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
In the middle of a public street? You really need to think things through.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Heh, you didn't think we were in actual trouble, did you?   
Even if things got tense, I'd never put you in danger.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
Then why'd we get a report from two ladies saying you were attacked by a group of punks?   
If you want to show off to your buddy, there's a time and place for it.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
Listen, I'm an officer of the law. I don't care who you are—anyone who disturbs the peace is gonna have to deal with me.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
As you can see, your friend here is a bit of a hothead.   
I know it won't be easy, but try and keep an eye on him, would you?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Leave it to me.   
I'm not sure I can.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Those are some bold words. But thanks.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Don't worry about it. I know how to pick my battles.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
My arm's healed, and we've got way more dependable people now. There's no better time to test my strength.   
Especially now that we have someone like you. We really lucked out on that one.   
So I'm gonna keep honing my skills. That way, I can put down anyone I face with my own two hands.   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
You really haven't changed at all...   
   
Officer Kurosawa   
In any case, don't get in over your heads.   
I have a hunch the guys you ran into were from a gang that's been active around here recently.   
Just be careful. You don't wanna get on their bad side, because once you're on it, you'll never get off.   
All right, it's late. You'd better head on home.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
So much for eating out. It's been nonstop interruptions all night.   
Kurosawa-san's right, though. We should probably head home. Sorry about this—I'll treat you some other time.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'm gonna do some jogging on the way back. You wanna join?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure...   
No thanks.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Good answer. It's dark, so watch out for cars.   
I'm gonna run ahead. You just follow at your own pace!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
......   
I ran back to the dorm.   
I feel like my stamina has improved   
after running that long of a distance...   
   
SYS_HPUP_0_0   
Max HP increased by 5.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You sure? You'd get home faster if you did.   
Well, I'm goin' ahead. Be careful on your way back!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I saw Sanada off, then   
went back to the dorm.   
My mind feels sharper after   
seeing Sanada's stoic expression...   
   
PFM_SPUP_0_0   
Max SP increased by 3.

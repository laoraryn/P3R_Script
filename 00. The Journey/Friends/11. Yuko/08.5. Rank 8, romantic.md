Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - Um, sorry that the party ended up being at my place...   
Sad - I was out buying stuff that might be useful for running practice, and I ran out of money.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's fine.   
This is a nice room.   
Stuff for the kids?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - ...Thanks.   
Happy - I could've taken stuff from our school's storage, but I knew the sizes would be slightly off.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Oh, r-really? Good thing I took the time to tidy up.   
Happy - Feel free to eat as many snacks as you want, okay?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Yeah. It's nothing that exciting though.   
Just things like supporters and ice packs. I know the ones at school wouldn't fit them quite right.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - It was a lot of hard work, but I'm glad we decided to coach those kids in the end.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
What do you think—   
   
......   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Surprised - ...Um, sorry!   
It's just, I never noticed how long your eyelashes are. I don't think I've looked at you this closely before...   
Sad - It's only the two of us here now. Maybe that's why I'm a little nervous.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Uh... H-How 'bout we change the subject. I'll ask you a question!   
Hmm... Oh, do you like children?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I do.   
Not really.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Really? Me too! I like how they're so pure and always try their best. It just makes me want to support them as much as I can.   
Happy - I realized recently how much I like to look after other people.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Hmm, I see.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Well, those kids said they like you, y'know.   
Happy - I think there's something about you that draws people in, Arisato-kun.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - I mean, even I—   
   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Surprised - ...Uh, I-I mean, never mind!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Let's see... Okay, next question!   
Let's say you get married and have a kid.   
Would you want it to be a boy or a girl?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
A boy.   
A girl.   
I don't care.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
I see... A boy, huh?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Boys have so much energy that they can be a handful, but I'm sure they make a house more lively.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Me too! We must be on the same wavelength!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - I would dress her up in all kinds of different outfits. She could be my little helper!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Is that really how guys think?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
...Oh! If you mean you don't care as long as the baby is healthy, then I agree with you.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - Either way, I would just hope that the baby didn't take after me. You could say I'm a little rough around the edges.   
Happy - But if they took after you, Arisato-kun, I'm sure they'd be super cute!   
Happy - They'd probably be athletic too. I wonder if they'll take an interest in sports...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko seems to be deep in thought.   
I feel like our relationship has grown...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - By the way, do you look more like your dad or your mom?   
Sad - I've been told that I'm the spitting image of my dad.   
Sad - It's not that I mind, but I do have mixed feelings about it.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - I mean, we don't look that much alike, right? My eyebrows aren't as bushy for one...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I chatted with Yuko for a while,   
and then returned to the dorm.

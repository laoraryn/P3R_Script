Happy - Oh, look, a yukata! Hm, maybe I should've worn one too...   
Happy - Don't you think I'd look good in one?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'm sure you would.   
I like your usual clothes too.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Y-You think so?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - I guess yukatas really are a must for summer festivals then!   
Happy - Although, they are kinda stuffy and hard to move in. They're more inconvenient than most people might think.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
The last time I wore one was when I was just a child. I remember taking it off right away because it was just too hot.   
Happy - ...Oh wait, that was a kimono.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - R-Really?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Wouldn't a yukata be better since it's the summer festival though?

Happy - Mmm, something smells good...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Hey, are you hungry, Arisato-kun?   
Happy - Let's eat some takoyaki! I'll split it with you.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - One order of takoyaki, please!   
Wait, this takoyaki... Is there no octopus in it?   
   
Takoyaki Vendor   
That's for you to eat and find out.   
Hang on a sec. I'll make one for you now.   
Just don't try to peek at what I'm putting inside!   
   
Takoyaki Vendor   
...Here you go, one order of takoyaki!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Here, have some, Arisato-kun.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Phew... Mm... Mm! Ack! Ooh, hot! Hot, hot!   
Happy - Mmm! It's so good! And so tender inside!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
But there's something really tough and chewy in the middle...   
Hmm... I wonder what was in it.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Look at all the different masks!   
Happy - My parents used to buy them for me when I was little. I always got the ones from that superhero TV show.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Oh look! They still have the same ones as back then! This really brings me back...

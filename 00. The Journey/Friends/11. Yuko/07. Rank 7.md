Meek-Looking Girl   
Coach! We raced 'em all one-on-one, and two of us actually won!   
   
Spunky Boy   
That means we tied the sixth graders! Can you believe it!?   
They said they're gonna let us use the schoolyard now! And they want to be friends with us!   
They think we're pretty fast for fourth graders, and told us we should play together sometime!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Aww, you guys...   
Happy - I never had a doubt! I know how hard you all worked!   
   
Spunky Boy   
Wow, thanks! Um... B-Big Sis!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Oh, you don't have to call me that if you don't want to. Auntie Yuko is fine.   
   
Spunky Boy   
One, two, three...!   
   
Kids   
Good luck with your boyfriend!

Happy - They called you my boyfriend till the very end...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Wanna make that true?   
It's embarrassing.   
They're just joking.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Surprised - Oh, okay... W-Wait, huh!?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Angry - H-Hey! Don't laugh! Joking like that is bad for my heart!   
Sad - You really got me. Saying something like that out of nowhere...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Right? I know they're just being kids, but still...   
Happy - Something about it gives me goosebumps.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Yeah, I know that.   
Sad - Those kids even call Kaz my boyfriend when I'm with him...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
......   
You know what this feels like?   
The end of some cheesy high school drama series.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - ......   
Sad - It's like the kids have left the nest...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Are you sad?   
Are you relieved?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Now that it's suddenly so quiet... Yeah, a little.   
Happy - Although, it was pretty tough at the beginning.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Angry - Well, of course! I was constantly worried someone would get hurt.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - To be honest, it was tough at the beginning, but now that they're gone, it feels kinda lonely.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Teaching those kids how to race... It was pretty fun.   
Happy - They looked so happy every time they got faster, and it made me happy too.   
Happy - That feeling of wanting to help them just kept growing bigger and bigger.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
You know, this might've been the first time I really put my heart into something.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
And it's not that I've been slacking off as a team manager...   
Happy - But, maybe helping and teaching people is more of my thing?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
It kinda made me think. About the things I should do for my future, I mean.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Oh! By the way, I wanted to thank you, Arisato-kun.   
Happy - Maybe we should throw a little party. You know, to celebrate our first attempt at coaching.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's do it.   
Why?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Yay! I can't wait!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - I mean, it took a lot of work to pull it off... Don't think it's a good idea?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Hmm, now where should we have the party at?   
Happy - I kinda want it to be somewhat fancy. I'll look around for a place!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko is full of enthusiasm.   
I feel like our relationship has grown...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
I didn't have much confidence at the beginning, so you being here with me was really—   
   
Happy - ...Well, let's talk about that next time. We'll have plenty of time at the party.   
Happy - Shall we head home?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I left school with Yuko.

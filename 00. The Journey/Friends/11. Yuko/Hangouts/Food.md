Sad - I'm so sorry about the other day. I shouldn't have forced you to be a coach.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Today's on me. Eat as much as you want.

Yuko seems motivated.

Y'know, I've kinda been second-guessing my decision... Maybe I should've thought about it more carefully before agreeing.   
Sure, I'm team manager and all, but I dunno if I'm ready to be a coach... What do you think?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You were a bit hasty.   
You're too nice.   
You're very responsible.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - So, you think so, too, Arisato-kun?   
Sad - My friend said the same thing...   
Sad - But I can't break my promise to those kids... Guess I better do some reading.

Yuko seems depressed.   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Oh, stop it. It's not like that.   
I'm just not very good at telling people "no."   
Happy - That's why everyone on the team keeps asking me for favors. You included.

Yuko seems happy...   
I learned a little more about her today.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - ...Thanks. I really appreciate that.   
Happy - I'm gonna read up on how to get better at running. I mean, I want those kids to win.

Yuko seems very happy.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Well, I better get my daily nutrients, too.

The two of us talked for a while longer   
before I headed back to the dorm.

Happy - Getting the cake set was definitely the right choice. That cheese tart was sooo good...   
Happy - I feel so refreshed! All that coaching left me exhausted. Nothing beats a helping of sweets...

I've had no time to myself lately between being team manager and a coach for those kids.   
But depending on how things go, we might be done with track around this time next year...   
Because we'd be busy as third-years and everything.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
I wonder what I'll be doing then...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Studying for entrance exams.   
Looking for a job.   
Nothing new.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Yeah, probably... Honestly, it seems like college is easier than high school.   
Happy - I mean, the hard part of college is passing the entrance exam and getting in, right?   
Happy - It's really all about long breaks and partying hard every night... Actually, that sounds awesome! Maybe I should go to college.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko seems to be having fun.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Going to work right after high school? Well, I guess that's always an option...   
Plus, if I live with my parents, I'll have plenty of spending money...   
...But I'm not sure I'm ready for that just yet.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko seems to be considering her options.   
I learned a little more about her today.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Angry - Hey, what's that supposed to mean? Are you saying I won't be any more grown up?   
Sad - I've been thinking about my future, too, you know...   
Sad - N-Not that I've really settled on anything, but... Anyways, I'm not always gonna be the same... I think.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko looks a little depressed.   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - ...You know what? I think I'm gonna get another cake! They say sugar can help with anxiety.   
By the way, what's your favorite type of cake, Arisato-kun? You like them less sweet?   
Happy - I personally like them with plenty of cream and fruits...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko and I talked about cakes for a while   
before I headed back to the dorm.

Happy - My throat is so dry! I think I overdid it.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Just so you know, this is just a pre-celebration for the end of our coaching duties!   
We still need to have a real celebration!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - You still have some time, right? What do you wanna do now?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's go to your place.   
Let's go to a café.   
Let's go to Wakatsu.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Surprised - Huh!? Are you serious!?   
Sad - Uh, my room is a mess right now! Maybe some other time, after I've cleaned up.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
How 'bout the café? It's not far from here.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko's excitement seems   
to have died down.   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Perfect! I was thinking the same thing. I could use a cold drink right about now.   
Happy - Let's go.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko seems very happy.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, are you hungry?   
Sad - Oh, hm... I'm not that hungry though.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - ......   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - All right, sure, why not! I feel like I'm getting a little hungry anyway!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko seems to be enjoying herself.   
I learned a little more about her today.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - You know, when we hang out like this and go to cafés or get food, it feels kinda like we're dat—   
   
Happy - Haha, I mean, uh... C'mon, let's go!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - You know, when we hang out like this and go to cafés or get food, it's almost like we're dating or something.   
Happy - Haha, I'm just kidding! C'mon, let's go!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
After hanging out with Yuko,   
I headed back to the dorm.

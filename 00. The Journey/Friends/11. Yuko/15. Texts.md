Hey there *thumbs up*   
   
   
Sorry for messaging you even though there's no track practice.    
I actually wanted to ask you a favor. Could you come see me if you're free?   
I'll probably be in the hallway on the second floor.   
   
-----   
   
You free today?   
   
   
Hello!    
Since there's no practice today, do you wanna hang out again? I wanna know how you're doing, too.  Aren't I the perfect team manager?   
I'll be at the second-floor hallway for a while. *thumbs up*   
   
-----   
   
Today's the day!   
   
   
Sorry about the other day.  I'd like to make it up to you.   
Wanna walk home together again?   
I'll be at the usual spot. Come see me if you can, okay? <3

Coaching!   
   
   
How's it going?    
Do you remember how I agreed to coach those kids for their race? I know they've been waiting for me, but do you have time to tag along?   
I don't know if I can do it alone... I'd love some of your advice!   
   
-----   
   
'Sup!   
   
   
'Sup, Coach Arisato! Lol :)   
It's about time to supervise the kids again.   
If you can make it, I'll ask for permission to use the practice field, so just let me know, okay?   
   
-----   
   
Get this!   
   
   
The kids finally raced against those sixth graders! :o   
They wanna tell me how they did, so... will you come with me?

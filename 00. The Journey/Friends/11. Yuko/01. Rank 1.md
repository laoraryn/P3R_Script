Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - It's tough being a team manager. You really don't get any respect.   
Sad - And the guys on the team all act like little kids.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Angry - "Where's my towel?" "Can you wash this for me?" Ugh, I'm not their mother, you know?   
At least I don't have to worry about gaining weight, since I'm always running around taking care of them.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
...How about you, Arisato-kun? Are you enjoying track and field?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's fun.   
I'm not sure yet.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Oh yeah? That's good to hear.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - Thought it might be boring for you, since you're so much better than everyone else.   
I can tell just by looking. It's like... you've got your own style, and you don't waste much energy.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Well, you did just start, so that makes sense.

Well, if you have any questions, just ask Kaz. Um, you know, Kazushi.   
You guys are in the same class, so I'm sure he'd be willing to help you.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - You can ask me too, if you want, since I'm the manager.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko seems to be looking out for me.   
I feel like the two of us   
have gotten a little closer...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, I've gotta run. There's a show I wanna catch.   
Happy - See you at school.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
After saying goodbye to Yuko,   
I decided to go back to the dorm.

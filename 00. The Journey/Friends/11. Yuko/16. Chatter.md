Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, hey there, Arisato-kun. Not much to do when there's no practice, huh?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, Arisato-kun.   
Happy - I was wondering what I should do since there's no practice today.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It seems Yuko wants   
to walk home together.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Hey, Arisato-kun. You heading home?   
Happy - We were interrupted last time, so if you're down, wanna try hanging out again?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Ah, hey, Arisato-kun. Are you free right now?   
Those kids had their race, and they said they wanna talk to us.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Not Usedラベルだよ。   
   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, Arisato-kun...   
Happy - Are you doing anything today? If not... maybe you could join me?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Heya, Arisato-kun. Are you about to leave?   
Happy - Wanna chat outside for a bit? The weather looks nice.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend some time   
after school with Yuko?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Spend time with her   
Check Social Link status   
Not now   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Oh, cool! Thanks!   
I can't rely on the other team members at all... You get it, right, Arisato-kun?   
Happy - Okay then, off to Paulownia Mall we go!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Sweet! Then let's go hang out somewhere fun.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Great! Then let's hit the town and have some fun this time!   
Happy - How about we head to Paulownia Mall? Maybe we could get some cake from Chagall, too!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - No backing out now, okay?   
Sad - Hm, where should we go...?   
Sad - ...How about my place? Don't worry, I tidied up beforehand!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - No backing out now, okay?   
Wanna grab a bite? I've got a few places in mind, but you can make the final choice.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Unused   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Really? Oh, perfect...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
U-Um, do you wanna come over again? I wanted to give you something...   
Surprised - That's all, really! Just wanted to give you a little something, no big deal! Right?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Thanks. You go on ahead to the field.   
I'm gonna stop by the faculty office to go over some notes.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh my god... You're kinda needy, aren't you, Arisato-kun?   
But I don't mind it...   
Happy - ...Wanna come over? But we better be quiet, so my parents don't find out...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, did you already make plans?   
I guess you do seem busy... Well, see you around.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, hey there, Arisato-kun.   
Ever since you helped me discover my dreams, I've been studying really hard, trying to make them come true.   
Happy - So whatever you decide to do, give it your 100%! I'll always be there for you, like how you were for me.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel an unbreakable bond   
with Yuko...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, hey, Arisato-kun.   
I've been studying really hard lately. You helped me discover my dreams, so now I'm gonna make them a reality.

Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, Arisato-kun.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
You know about the nightclub at Paulownia Mall, right?   
I've never really cared for it since the place seems kinda sketchy. I hear a weird crowd hangs around there.   
Like, there's some guy dressed as a monk partying hard every night.   
Sad - There's no way he's a real monk, right...? Are monks even allowed to drink alcohol?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I got a lead from Yuko about a monk   
who "parties hard" at a nightclub.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, yeah. Those kids have really been getting on my case about this whole coaching thing.   
Happy - The track's open since there's no practice today, so I'm wondering if I should just do it...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
By the way, are you heading out soon?   
I was thinking about what to do since there's no practice today.

Happy - By the way, are you about to leave?   
Happy - Wanna chat outside for a bit? The weather looks nice.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, hey, Arisato-kun. Exams are finally over, huh?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh yeah. Exams are finally over, huh?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Congrats on surviving. Hopefully, you're not too beat from all the studying?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Congrats on surviving. Now we have time to do whatever we wanna do.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Congrats on surviving. Man, it feels like a fog has lifted—like I can finally see what's in front of me.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, Arisato-kun.   
I've actually gotta head out now to do some shopping for the track team. Like, buying athletic tape and stuff.   
Happy - There's a lot, so it'd be nice if I had an extra hand or two to carry everything... Hint, hint.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, are you free today?

Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - There's no practice today, so it's the perfect time to relax. If you're leaving, wanna hang out?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Cool! Hm, where should we go then?   
Happy - Should we get something to eat? Or maybe do some karaoke? Let's decide on the way out.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh hey, are you free today?   
Happy - We were interrupted last time, so if you're down, wanna try hanging out again?

The track's open since there's no practice today, so I'm wondering if I should just do it...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Okay, great! I'm gonna ask the teacher for permission to use the track then.   
Happy - I'll see you at the field! Countin' on ya, Coach!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, Arisato-kun. Are you busy today?   
Happy - I was thinking of coaching those kids some more. They were really looking forward to it.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Great! Thanks.   
I did a bunch of research on my end for this, so let's give 'em a real workout!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, okay. I'll go call them over, then.   
Sad - I wonder how they did... Now I'm getting nervous.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, Arisato-kun. Are you free today...?   
Happy - I'm pretty much ready to throw that party, so I thought today might be a good time...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, by the way... are you free today?   
Happy - I'm pretty much ready to throw that party, so I thought today might be a good time...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, Arisato-kun. Are you free today...?

Oh yeah... Are you free today?   
Happy - I figured today might be a good time to throw that party...

Happy - Oh, Arisato-kun.   
Happy - If you're leaving, wanna hang out somewhere? We all need to take a breather sometimes, right?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
If you're leaving, wanna hang out somewhere? We all need to take a breather sometimes, right?

Oh, did you need to take care of something?   
Happy - Sorry, I had no clue you were busy. I'll catch you later.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, did you already have plans? All right, see you around.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, that's too bad... Maybe next time, then!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - Oh, you can't do today, huh...   
Happy - All right, maybe next time. See you then!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - Oh... You can't?   
Guess there's nothing we can do about that. Maybe next time.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - Oh, you already had plans, huh... That's too bad.   
Happy - I'll try again some other time then. See you later.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - Oh... I guess that was too sudden.   
Happy - Dang, I was really looking forward to it, you know. Well, see you around.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - O-Oh... That's too bad.   
Happy - You're busy, right? I'll see you around, then.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - ...Oh, gotcha.   
Happy - Sorry for asking so suddenly. I'll try again some other time.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, you can't do today?   
Happy - Hm, guess I'll just head on home, then. Let's try again some other time.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, you're busy?   
Happy - Let me know when you're free, okay? See you.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, all right. Next time, then.   
Happy - Maybe I'll just head home and do some studying. Catch you later.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Let's work hard! Seriously! I'll be cheering you on, too, Arisato-kun!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, hey, Arisato-kun. Even though we were just on a train the whole day, I'm feeling pretty tired.   
Happy - But you know what? I've been totally psyched for this trip!   
Happy - I wanna sample the local food, hit the hot springs, shop for souvenirs...   
Happy - Oh, and I'm a pro at pillow fights! I sling 'em so fast they'll never see it comin'!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Then after lights-out, we girls get together and gush about who we like...   
Happy - ...And this year, I've got a lot to say.   
Surprised - O-Oh, by the way, have you checked out this vending machine?   
You don't really see these drinks back home.   
Maybe I should buy some as a souvenir...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
The drinks in this vending machine aren't sold anywhere back home.   
Happy - This might be the only chance you get to buy 'em... It's pretty tempting, huh?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Oh, you're wearing a yukata! Lookin' good, Arisato-kun!   
It's a different look than usual. Maybe I should go get changed, too!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Oh, you're wearing the yukata! It looks good on you, Arisato-kun!   
...You look kinda different than usual. Good different.   
......   
You know... my group actually passed yours earlier today.   
Sad - I guess you didn't notice me, though...   
Sad - I thought about calling out to you, but I just couldn't.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Why?   
Sorry, I didn't realize.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - Well... I don't really know why, but...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Surprised - No, it's okay! Don't worry about it!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
It's just... when you're with your friends from the dorm, you're like a different person.   
You wear certain expressions around them... that I never get to see when you're with me.   
Not that it really matters or anything...   
Sad - ......   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Angry - Urgh... Sorry, I didn't mean to be all weird about this!   
Angry - So basically, I was feeling lonely, and all I wanted was for you to notice me!   
Whew... Glad I got that off my chest.   
Happy - I just... wanted to walk around Kyoto with you.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Sorry for getting all weird like that. But... I really did want to spend time with you in Kyoto.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, hey, Arisato-kun.   
Sad - This trip went by in a blur. I can't believe we're already heading home tomorrow.   
Sad - I don't really care much for temples, but I still had a lot of fun.   
Happy - Let's hang out after we get back!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Oh, hey, Arisato-kun.   
This trip went by in a blur. I can't believe we're already heading home tomorrow.   
Sad - But since we were in different groups... it was also kind of a bummer.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I feel the same way.   
Our hands were tied.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Y-You do? So we both felt the same way...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - True... The teachers are keeping an eye on us since it's still a school activity.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
......   
You know, when I visited the temples earlier today, I kept thinking about you.   
Happy - Like what it'd be like if you were there... Or if you'd like this keychain I got for you.   
Happy - I even saw a Buddhist statue that reminded me a little of you, Arisato-kun.   
Happy - Haha, but now that I've gotten a good look at you, I don't really see the resemblance.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
You know what, Arisato-kun...?   
I think... I like it best when I'm with you.   
Sad - ......   
Happy - Let's go on a date once we get home, okay?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Sorry for taking up so much time. Let's go on a date once we get home, okay?

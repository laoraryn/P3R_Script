Yuko Nishiwaki   
...So then I went to ask about it after class, and you know what happened?   
Miyahara just wouldn't stop talking! He wrote out some weird math formula and said, "It's beautiful, isn't it?"   
Sad - All it did was make me more confused than I originally was. Guess I'll have to go ask again tomorrow.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You're so hardworking.   
Why go through all that trouble?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Y-You think so?   
I guess it just feels wrong to not try and understand something.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - I mean... doesn't it feel wrong to not try and understand something?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Anyways, I decided to start being serious about my future.   
Remember when I told you about what happened to me at school?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
It was when I handed in a blank answer sheet for that pop quiz, and I got yelled at by Ekoda...   
Back then, I just wanted to graduate and go to a community college or something.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
But after coaching those kids, I started to realize something.   
I enjoy helping people who are willing to give it their all. So, I've finally figured out what I wanna do with my life.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Can you guess what it is?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
A track and field star?   
An instructor?   
A nursery teacher?   
No idea...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - No, not that. I'd rather just teach. Being a professional athlete is too hard.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Hmm... Close! You almost got it, Mr. Ex-Assistant Coach!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
I did consider that one too, but I decided I should focus on one thing specifically.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Come on, Arisato-kun, are you really that dense? Or did I not spell it out enough?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
I'm thinking of becoming an athletic trainer.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
It's their job to monitor each athlete's diet, and help them plan their training routine.   
So I'll go to professional school once I graduate, and then work towards earning my certification when I turn twenty.   
Between the general education requirements and the classes for my major, it's gonna be over 350 hours.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
That's why I'm gonna start studying right now.   
Improving my writing is my first goal. It took me all night to finish that three page essay.   
But those kids had a huge influence on me. I know I only agreed to coach them on a whim, but teaching them really made me think.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - I started wondering what I could teach my own kids one day... And I realized I didn't have the slightest clue.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
If you hadn't been there with me, I don't think I could've stuck it out until the end.   
And I definitely never would've thought about my future, either.   
Happy - So... thanks.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko seems appreciative.   
I feel like our relationship has grown...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - A-Also...   
Sad - I know I'm always asking you to stick around and help me with stuff.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - I just... I kinda feel bad about it. I'm sorry.   
Sad - I realized now that I might've been relying too much on you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I don't mind.   
You can rely on me even more.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Sad - ......   
Sad - Wh-Why...   
Sad - Why are you... so nice to me?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko seems restless.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I better choose my words carefully here...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I better choose my words carefully here...   
Come to think of it, **I have a special**   
**relationship with another person already**...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Are you like this... just with me? N-No, no, th-that can't be it, huh...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's because I love you.   
It's because you're a close friend.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
......   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Surprised - Huh!?   
Surprised - What? Y-You mean, me...?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Surprised - A-Are you... Are you sure!? I'm not girly or anything like that, y'know?   
Surprised - What's happening...? Is this a dream?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I love you, Yuko.   
It's not a dream.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Surprised - U-Um...   
Surprised - Me... Me too...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko's face is bright red...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Surprised - Y-Yeah, guess not!   
Sad - My heart is pumping so fast, there's no way it could be a dream.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko's face is bright red...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - I... feel the same way as you do, Arisato-kun.   
Happy - That's why... I'm so happy.   
Happy - ...Thank you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I have entered a special   
relationship with Yuko...   
There's no going back now...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Surprised - ...Uh, I have to go. I've gotta study!   
Happy - ......   
Happy - Um, I'm looking forward to... us.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
After saying goodbye to Yuko,   
I decided to go back to the dorm.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Y-Yeah, of course!   
Happy - I sure am lucky to have such a good friend who's so kind and reliable.   
Sad - Although, sometimes you worry me a little...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Arisato-kun, sometimes you say suggestive things with a straight face, y'know?   
I get the feeling you might give someone the wrong idea.   
Angry - So you should really be careful about that. It could land you in some hot water.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Okay, I will.   
Why?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - That's the way. Take my advice to heart!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko seems relieved.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Surprised - Wait, are you seriously asking me that?   
Sad - Um, just watch your back out there, okay? Seems like you're headed for trouble.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko seems to be worried about me...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - ...Sorry, this isn't what I wanted to talk about.   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Um, Arisato-kun...   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Thank you again for coaching with me. I'm glad I had someone like you to rely on.   
......   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - Next time, I'll be there to support you!   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
Happy - If there's anything I can help with, just let me know, okay? We're friends, aren't we?   
   
Yuko Nishiwaki   
I'm gonna head out. I've got to work on my modern literature and English today.   
See ya!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yuko left the café in a hurry.   
I should head back to the dorm...

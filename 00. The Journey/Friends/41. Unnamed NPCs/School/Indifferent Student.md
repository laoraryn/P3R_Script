New school years sure are rough.   
New teachers, new classmates... It's exhausting having to start over every year.

Being on a diet sucks.   
Maybe you didn't notice, but I look different than I used to.

When you go to a new school, you have to worry about where you'll sit, too.   
It would suck if you ended up in the front row.

It sucks trying to make new friends when you transfer...   
You have to remember everybody's name, and you can't really say no to their offers.

Exams suck, don't they?   
You have to study so much and your score gets posted...   
And if you do bad, everyone will laugh at you.

Rumors suck, man.   
That one about the girl who collapsed is already all over the school.   
I hope no one spreads any rumors about me.

It must suck to be a bully...   
You have to pretend to be nice so no one gets suspicious.   
And if someone finds out, you'd have to be even nicer to them.

It must suck being unconscious...   
I mean, you don't even know if you'll wake up or not.

Summer sucks, man.   
I sweat so much my shirt gets drenched.   
   
Indifferent Student   
It must suck to be the "new girl."   
All the guys hit on you and pressure you right away.   
But Aigis-san seems fine...

The culture festival kinda sucks, don't you think?   
I mean, there's always that one person who's so gung ho, and makes everyone else get involved.   
By the way, that person is NOT me.

It sucks when a student passes away...   
No matter what really happened, there's always rumors.   
   
Indifferent Student   
Exams suck, man.   
People completely forgot about that guy Aragaki now that they're studying.   
Or maybe they never cared about his death in the first place.   
   
Indifferent Student   
It must suck being from such an influential family.   
I bet some people aren't sad at all about what happened... They just want to make a grab for power.   
By the way, did you know the Kirijo Group built this school?   
I hope nothing bad happens...   
   
Indifferent Student   
It must suck to move here from another country.   
You're always the center of attention.   
But Mochizuki-kun seems to be enjoying it.   
   
Indifferent Student   
So many things happened during the school trip...   
People got all crazy and did things they wouldn't normally do.   
For example, peeking at girls in the hot springs. That wasn't you, was it?

What did you just say?   
Say that again. Go on.

H-Hey, lighten up... I was just joking.

Christmas sucks, man.   
Behind all those presents, there's a vicious sales war raging.   
I wonder how many people commit suicide during Christmas.   
   
Indifferent Student   
New Year's Day sucks, man.   
Everyone expects you to make a resolution...   
...even though there's no way you'll keep it.   
   
Indifferent Student   
Choosing a career sucks, man.   
...I'm serious this time.   
Shit, what should I do...?

Changing years sucks, man.   
It's such a hassle to learn the new routine.

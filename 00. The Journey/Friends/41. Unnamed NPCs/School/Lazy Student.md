It's already a new school year? Ugh, going to school sucks...   
The monorail, too. I was stoked to ride it at first, but now it's just boring.

Everyone I know is in a club, but...   
...I just can't be bothered to join one.   
They all say I'll make a lot of friends and all that, but...   
...I say, whatever.   
   
Lazy Student   
I can't understand why people are freaking out over those ghost stories.   
I mean, running around school screaming and spreading rumors...   
They all need to just grow up.   
   
Lazy Student   
It's almost summer vacation.   
I used to love summer vacation when I was a kid...   
But now it's like, whatever. I just don't get excited about it anymore.

Culture festival this, culture festival that...   
Everyone just loooves the culture festival!   
But not me, dude. I think it's a waste of time.   
I hope there's a typhoon or something so they'll have to cancel it.   
...Maybe that's a bit much, huh?   
   
Lazy Student   
Wh-What!? I haven't done anything wrong!

I didn't say you did.   
Okay.   
It's all your fault.   
   
Lazy Student   
Wait, you're not here about... that?   
Phew... Don't scare me like that.   
   
Lazy Student   
Yeah, that's right. No one has to know.   
   
Lazy Student   
I... I mean, I did wish for the typhoon.   
I even hung voodoo dolls upside down with lots of needles stuck in their heads.   
But I didn't think a typhoon would really come! It was an accident!   
It's not my fault!   
   
Lazy Student   
Man, Kirijo-san is impressive.   
Her dad just died, but she still went to a meeting about the future of the Kirijo Group.   
She's a real go-getter, that one.   
I wish I could be like that... Ah, who am I kidding? I like being lazy.   
   
Lazy Student   
Dude, what's the deal with career experience?   
They made me carry cardboard boxes around all day...   
My arms are friggin' killing me.   
   
Lazy Student   
Man... I don't feel like doing anything.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Me neither.   
You should, though.   
   
Lazy Student   
You know what I mean, right?   
It's like everything is this huge waste of time now... I think the world should just end.   
   
Lazy Student   
But doing things is hard... How do you do it?   
   
Lazy Student   
As long as you pass your exams, you'll be fine.   
But I never study for my exams 'cause I'm too lazy.

Last time I was hanging out at the strip mall, I saw a dude with a wild fashion sense.   
Long, wavy hair, no shirt, and tattoos all up and down his arms.   
I know it might be unseasonably warm, but he kinda went overboard...   
But hey, maybe it's cool to let your freak flag fly.   
If I was more like him, not givin' a rip what people think, I wouldn't have a care in the world.   
   
Lazy Student   
Everyone's making friends these days... I dunno. It seems like a lot of work.   
I know there's an upside to having friends, but...   
I wish there was a way to do it without all that "bonding" stuff, y'know?   
   
Lazy Student   
Man, I'm so lazy these days.   
Think I've got that Apathy Syndrome thing?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I doubt it.   
Maybe.   
Get better soon.   
   
Lazy Student   
Yeah, I guess it's just plain ol' laziness.   
   
Lazy Student   
Dude, I was just kidding. Don't take it so seriously, man.   
   
Lazy Student   
H-Hey, I was just kidding!   
   
Lazy Student   
On hot days like this, you gotta go to the manga café. It's nice and cool, and you can read all the manga you want.   
They have PCs to access the Internet there, too.   
Oh, that reminds me... Sometimes I see this weird guy there...   
He's always banging away on that little laptop of his, muttering to himself...   
And he's always got that briefcase, too... Is he, like, a day trader or something?   
   
Lazy Student   
Isn't the town messy these days?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure is.   
Is it?   
I like it this way.   
   
Lazy Student   
Right? Right? The people are weird these days, too...   
I'm already lazy, but I think I'm going to get even lazier...   
   
Lazy Student   
I'm telling you, man...   
   
Lazy Student   
Dude, you're messed up. Did something bad happen to you?   
   
Lazy Student   
Man, school has started... I'm so lazy.   
Why? Listen, I don't need a reason to be lazy. Besides, everyone gets like this after days off.   
It's the truth, man.   
   
Lazy Student   
I heard some guy made friends with some workers, but isn't that a waste of time?   
I'm fine being a customer. I don't need to be "friends" too, you know?   
I mean, I'm sure there's an upside to it, but... I'll pass anyway.   
Too much trouble...   
   
Lazy Student   
Dude, check this out. There's lazy people all over.   
What's going through their minds? Nothing, I guess...   
I'm so jealous, man. I wanna be just like them.   
I'm already naturally lazy, so I've got a head start on achieving total blankness of mind!   
   
Lazy Student   
You sure see a lot of couples during summer vacation, huh?   
Maybe I should get a girlfriend... It's a lot of trouble, though.   
Like just now, I saw a couple having an argument, and the girl was like...   
"I'm gonna report you to that revenge website!"   
What was she even talking about?   
   
Lazy Student   
*sigh* I'm so lazy...   
Guess why...

Second term started?   
Is it the heat?   
You have Apathy Syndrome?   
I have no idea.   
   
Lazy Student   
Yep. You know me, man.   
   
Lazy Student   
Well, that too.   
But it's mainly 'cause I'm still stuck in summer vacation mode...   
   
Lazy Student   
Aww, c'mon. I'm not that bad.   
   
Lazy Student   
Sheesh, way to kill the conversation. Now I feel even lazier...   
   
Lazy Student   
That Aragaki guy died at the gang spot, right?   
Sometimes I'll aimlessly wander around there, but...   
I should quit doing that.   
   
Lazy Student   
The people who believe in the End have at least some energy left...   
I mean, they have enough in them to believe in something, y'know?   
I don't even have that much, man. It's over for me.

Studying is so much work...   
But there's this college I really want to get into, so...   
I guess I'll put in the effort.

You can tell how fashionable a person is by how they wear their school uniform.   
I'm gonna brush up on the latest trends to show off my best self!

My parents always nag me to, like, study for exams and stuff. They're so annoying!   
I just became a second-year... I'm supposed to be having fun!   
They just came into some money, so they're getting all strict about my future and junk.   
   
Stylish Student   
School uniforms are so boring. I wish they'd allow us to wear our own clothes.   
Yeah, like that'll happen...   
   
Stylish Student   
My parents are bugging me to choose a college.   
Who decides that stuff in their second year? I just started!   
They say the best way to make God laugh is to make a plan... I bet my parents have made him die laughing.

I'm going shopping soon. It's been a while.

What are you buying?   
I see.   
   
Stylish Student   
I need new clothes. The summer fashions are almost here.   
   
Stylish Student   
You don't seem very interested...   
   
Stylish Student   
Everyone's talking about the ghost and that kind of stuff...   
I hate those kinds of stories.   
Like how they say the ghost will get you if you stay at school for too long...   
...Um, I better get going! See ya!   
   
Stylish Student   
Hey, I saw this girl last time, in front of the station...   
She was wearing a frilly white dress! It was like a "white goth"!   
Isn't it getting hot to be wearing those kinds of clothes...?   
She must be seriously devoted to her look.   
There's no way I could pull that off in this kind of weather...   
   
Stylish Student   
I heard from a friend online about this freaky site that's really taking off.   
She said it's about revenge or something.   
   
Stylish Student   
Well, there's that revenge website, but...   
It sounds like just a rumor to me.   
   
Stylish Student   
My parents get on my nerves with all that "You better study!" crap.   
I wanna go out for summer vacation, but I don't know if they'll let me.   
This sucks...   
   
Stylish Student   
I totally knew it!   
My parents were so annoying, saying, "Go study! Go study!"   
I wasn't able to wear my great new clothes during summer break!   
The sky was blue... The sea was blue... Why did my heart have to be blue, too!?   
   
Stylish Student   
I've been thinking... Don't you think Aigis seems different somehow?   
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying she's a weirdo.   
She seems like... a doll. When I see her, I'm reminded of a clothing store mannequin.

It's all in your mind.   
You're not far off...   
   
Stylish Student   
Haha, I thought as much.   
   
Stylish Student   
Haha... You don't have to agree with me. It's probably just my imagination, after all.   
   
Stylish Student   
It sucks that they canceled the culture festival.   
I was looking forward to seeing the out-there fashions, like the maid costumes and stuff.   
   
Stylish Student   
My parents want me to go to one of those four-year colleges.   
And after that, they think I should be a lawyer, or something smart like that.   
*sigh* This is gonna suck...   
   
Stylish Student   
I told my parents what I wanted to do.   
I said I wanted to do something related to fashion, and I'm going to school for that.   
I knew they wouldn't agree with that... You could tell by their faces.   
   
Stylish Student   
Ryoji-kun seems a little different.   
He's got an exotic face... No Japanese guy would ever look like that.   
I should hang out with him some weekend and check out his fashion style.   
   
Stylish Student   
I HATE my stupid parents!   
They said anyone who doesn't graduate from a four-year college has no future!   
That's discrimination against the undereducated!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It sure is.   
You can't escape it.   
   
Stylish Student   
You agree, right? I'm not going to back down to them this time.   
   
Stylish Student   
Is that really how it is...?   
   
Stylish Student   
I love Christmas!   
The whole town lights up... I get all excited!   
   
Stylish Student   
Now that Christmas is over, all the stores are closing, and all the lights have been taken down.   
Usually, there's a post-Christmas sale war... But it feels weird.   
   
Stylish Student   
This is so lame... I can't decide on anything.   
I never have this much trouble picking outfits.   
Oh... I guess my clothes and my future are totally different things, huh? *sigh*

I've decided to go to a four-year college. I think it's true that you need a good education in life.   
But that doesn't mean I've given up!   
I'll get into the fashion industry, even if I have to take a part-time job or something like that!

Some people think that visiting shrines is boring, but I'm really looking forward to it.   
I'm gonna go to romance shrines and pray a lot.

When I went to the romance shrine, there were loads and loads of girls just praying desperately!   
I asked what all the fuss was about, and it turns out that they were all fans of Sanada-senpai!   
Normally, they'd get angry if one of them made a move like that, but if they were all there together...

A local guy talked to me today.   
I wonder if my prayers at the romance shrine are starting to have an effect!   
Maybe I'll score a boyfriend by Christmas this year!

Hmmm... This is certainly a fascinating forum...   
Hm? Are you interested in the dark web too...?   
I collect information from various people about "interesting" sites and forums...   
If you want, I can sell you some info... Top secret stuff, even...   
   
Suspicious Man   
Heh, you're a curious one, aren't you...? Well, go on and take a look.   
   
Suspicious Man   
Thanks... I'll be on the search for more exquisite info...   
   
Suspicious Man   
Come again...   
   
Suspicious Man   
Sorry, I'm a little busy tonight... Come back some other time, won't ya?   
   
Suspicious Man   
Hm? What do you want?   
You got guts, comin' to a place like this on your own...   
Well, I'd be happy to sell you some info on... "unconventional" websites, but...   
Do you have your own computer? You'll need one to make use of my services...

Looks like I can get information   
on unusual websites here...   
**If I can use a computer at the dorm**, I might   
be able to look into these websites...

Oh, hey. I didn't expect to see you somewhere other than the club.   
There's been a lot of discussion on the Internet lately about cults and mysterious incidents...   
But I'm sure whoever knows what's really going on isn't on the Internet...   
Besides, even if there were an explanation, I'm not sure I could trust it...   
What's true and what's false... Those who cannot discern the difference will not survive.

Only those who have the ability to discern truth from falsehood can survive in this digital age.

Everywhere you look, you see young couples.   
Well, what're you waiting for? Go after someone!   
You're still young. You've got no excuse not to be together with some girl.

You know the coffee shop, right? That fancy-looking one, Chagall.   
There's that club next to it. Kind of a "mature" hang-out spot, I suppose.   
I can't say I approve of places like that, but I suppose I can't tell you what to do.

Those youngsters look like their souls have been taken...   
They better stop lounging around like that. They should go out, make some friends, enjoy life!

This kind of place takes me back...   
Dance halls... We used to call 'em speakeasies! Those halls were packed with people...   
That's where I stole my wife's heart—at the dance hall! I was one hep cat back then...

I heard "escapade" means "mischief."   
If I had to guess based on that place, I'd say it means, "Stay up all night and make lots of noise."

I know this guy from when I was your age. He's a grave digger.   
He told me, "When you die, I'll dig you a fine, big grave."   
It was nice of him. Good friends are a blessing, they really are.

Times have changed, but some things, like schools having ghost stories, never do.   
I used to sneak into the school grounds at night. The teachers would give me holy hell for it.

Say, what kinda dance is popular nowadays in the clubs? Reggae? That "rap" junk?   
In my day, it was the tango, or the jitterbug. You danced with your girl, not to show off.   
I fell in love at first sight with my wife at one of those dance halls...

That mysterious Apathy Syndrome affecting couples is on the rise... Do you have a girlfriend?   
Men have to fight for their women, even if you know you can't win.   
I'm proud to say that's what I did in my day.

I heard there's some scary shenanigans going on over those Intertubes these days.   
How about that? I'm pretty in the know for an old guy, huh?

It's summer vacation, isn't it? You young folk are supposed to be havin' the time of your lives.   
You're young. You have plenty of time to make mistakes. In the end, they'll all be fond memories.

I like to take walks around the station, and sometimes I see a peculiar-looking girl.   
Now don't freak out, but listen to this... She's got a sword stuck through her head!   
I know those young girls like the piercings, but... through the entire head?   
Eh? You think it was some kinda trick? Well, if it was, it sure fooled me.

In summer, the girls show more skin to catch the fellows' eyes.   
It takes me back to the days when I'd find a sweetheart in summer and break up before fall...

There are so many strange people out there... Like that young man I saw the other day.   
I just noticed that there seemed to be a gap in the stream of people walking.   
I wondered why, so I took a gander, and then I understood why nobody was walking there.   
It was this kid with no shirt on and long, gray hair. He had this weird aura to him...   
I ask you, what is this world coming to...?   
   
Cheerful Old Man   
So the culture festival was called off on account of the typhoon, eh? What a waste...   
Well, don't be too glum. You've got plenty of time to live, so you can wait for the next one.

There's this friend I've had since we were in short pants. He's a great singer.   
He said, "When you die, I'll sing a song at your funeral."   
It was real nice of him. Him and me, we go waaay back.   
   
Cheerful Old Man   
Those youngsters who look all down in the mouth should try harder to make some friends...   
They're all on that "net" thing nowadays. They probably don't know how to talk to real people...   
   
Cheerful Old Man   
This is the season where kids who don't have a sweetheart get all lonely. I blame the cold.   
Just don't try your hand with too many girls at once, or you could cause yourself some trouble.   
   
Cheerful Old Man   
Don't be too hesitant to mix it up at a club. You could meet some new people!   
Those Mrs. Grundys at the PTA might disapprove, but you should dance till sunrise!

A friend of mine just died... He always wanted to become an astronaut.   
He said to me, "Even when I die, I'll always watch out for you."   
I'll remember him every time I look up at the night sky... In my heart, he's the best astronaut there is.

On New Year's, I always get together with my old school friends for some sake.   
But every year... a few more of them don't show up. It can't be helped, at my age...

Even if email is in vogue today, I'm still happy to get New Year's cards.   
You got any friends you could send New Year's cards to?

I do.   
I don't.

You ever hear the rhyme? "Make new friends, but keep the old; one is silver, and the other's gold."

At your age? Now that's depressing.   
Your New Year's resolution oughta be to meet new people, then.

It seems to be the thing to do to join that cult thing now...   
Why isn't anyone trying to stop them from doing such a damn fool thing?   
   
Cheerful Old Man   
You worry 'cause you're confused, and you're confused 'cause you don't know what to believe.   
Humans are frail creatures. It's hard for us to stand on our own two feet...   
My advice to you youngsters is to make friends, and believe in them with all your heart.

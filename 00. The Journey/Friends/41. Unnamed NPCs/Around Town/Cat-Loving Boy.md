My friend has a cat, and it's sooo cute!   
I'm not allowed to have one though... So I just try to get my fill of cats by looking at strays.

My friend has a cat, and it's sooo cute!   
I want one too, but my mom hates animals...   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
I played with my friend's cat at his house again.   
*sigh* I want a cat, too...   
I know my mom hates animals, but maybe I should ask her...   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
I asked my mom for a cat, and she said no.   
"No," "No," "No"... That's all she ever says.   
*sigh* I want a cat...   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
I tried to convince my dad to get a cat.   
He said no, too.   
Cats cost a lot, and their food and stuff costs a lot too...   
So we can't afford one.   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
I asked my friend if his cat was really expensive.   
You know what? He said it was free!   
He said his mom got the cat from the animal shelter.   
I didn't know you could do that. I thought you could only get cats from pet stores.   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
I talked to my dad about getting a cat again.   
I told him cats from the animal shelter are free...   
But he still said no.   
Even though he's okay with it, if my mom says no, he has to say no, too.   
So only my mom can decide... My dad sucks.   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
My friend at school said there was a stray cat around here.   
I'm waiting here until he comes out.   
I'm not gonna catch him or anything, I just want to see him.   
I wonder what kind of cat he is...   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
You know how there's a lot of food places here?   
That stray cat gets leftovers from the owners.   
I asked them what time the cat usually comes, and they told me...   
I'm gonna see that cat no matter what!   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
What kind of cat do you think this is?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I don't know.   
A stray cat.   
I don't care.   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
Okay! Then I'll tell you!   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
Aww... You could tell, huh?   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
You're so mean! But I'll tell you the answer anyway...   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
It's a stray cat!   
But he's my friend. The first time I met him, he didn't even run away. He came up to my hand.   
So that means he's my "soulmate," right?   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
He only eats leftovers from the shops...   
I think he's getting tired of it.   
Maybe I should get a saucer of milk for him!   
Yeah, I'm gonna go buy some milk. He'll like that, I think.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's a good idea.   
That's a bad idea.   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
Yeah! He'll probably love it!   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
R-Really!? He'll get a stomachache if he drinks regular milk?   
I didn't know that! Thanks so much for telling me!   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
I'm gonna buy him some milk for next time.   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
So regular milk is bad for cats... Okay, I'll remember that.   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
I asked my friends about what to feed cats, and I read about it, too.   
I found out there's a lot of things that cats shouldn't eat.   
Like that milk I wanted to give him last time, that's one of them.   
I was surprised, but I learned something.   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
I asked my dad if I can take this cat home.   
He said he wouldn't mind, but it's all up to my mom.   
*sigh* I know what she's going to say... What should I do...?   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
What should I do? That cat went somewhere...   
No one knows where he went.   
Maybe it was 'cause of that typhoon?   
If he could've come home with me before, this wouldn't have happened...   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
Hey, look! Look! The cat came back!   
Wow... He survived the typhoon.   
Or did he just hide somewhere?   
Well, it doesn't matter. Either way, I'm glad he's okay.   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
I decided I want to take that cat home with me.   
I'm going to convince my mom to let me keep him as a pet.   
No matter what she says, I'm not gonna back down.   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
That man and the lady... The old man and old lady, too...   
Why are they just standing there, staring at nothing...?   
Are they so tired that they don't want to do anything anymore?   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
My mom said I can't have a cat, no matter what.   
But it's okay. My dad is on my side!   
I'm gonna learn all about cats, and show her I can take care of one...   
Then my dad will convince my mom!   
I'll do my best!   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
It's getting cold...   
I can just go inside, but I wonder about him...   
I heard there's a lot of warm places around here, but...   
Is he really going to be okay?   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
I studied all about cats.   
I learned cats can't see the color red. I wonder what that's like...   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
I studied all about cats, and I told my dad about it.   
He said I did a great job, and he was impressed!   
And he promised he was gonna convince my mom!   
I hope I can get this cat...   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
This cat has been acting weird. He keeps staring into space.   
I don't understand.   
But I think my mom's going to let me keep this cat soon!   
Today, when my dad comes home from work, we're going to ask together.   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
I tried putting on cat ears, but the cat still won't even look at me...   
Maybe if I had a cat toy... But I don't think I have enough to buy one...   
Oh! Is that a cat toy!? Do you have a pet cat?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Nope. You can have this.   
Yeah, this is for my cat.   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
I can!? Thanks!   
I should give you something in exchange... Oh, I know!   
You can have this cat ear headband. I don't need it anymore.   
Here you go.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Maybe Elizabeth would like this headband...   
I should try showing it to her.   
   
Cat-Loving Boy   
Oh, really? I wish I had a cat.

Cat-Loving Boy - MSG_000_0_0   
Oh, that cat? He's not here.   
My mom said it was okay to take him home, and I came the next day to pick him up, but he was gone.   
That means he was free, right?   
So I bet things will be better for him this way.   
It's okay... I won't look for him.   
I know he's doing great, somewhere out there.

Boy's Mother - MSG_000_0_0   
I'm not fond of animals, it's true, but...   
After seeing my son get that serious about it, I felt like I should give it a chance anyway.   
I wish I would've made that decision earlier...

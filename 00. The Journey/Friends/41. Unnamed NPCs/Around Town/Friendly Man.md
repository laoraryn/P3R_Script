Nothing's happening nowadays... I guess that's what peace means.   
How about you? Anything dramatic happening in your life?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah...   
Nope.   
   
Friendly Man   
I see... Sounds tough. Well, good luck with whatever it is!   
   
Friendly Man   
See? Nothing really is happening...   
   
Friendly Man   
I heard a buncha stuff is happening out there. How about it?   
Is anything happening out there with you?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah.   
No.   
   
Friendly Man   
Oh, cool. Well, not here.   
   
Friendly Man   
Me neither, man.   
I keep hearing about this stuff, but I never get to see it. Is it all just a joke?   
   
Friendly Man   
Dude, that rumor is just getting started! This time, I hear it's about couples!   
The culprit must be a single guy... He's jealous of couples, see?   
But man, if I had that kind of power, I'd get myself a woman!   
   
Friendly Man   
I heard it's almost time for the summer festival. Dammit... I don't have anyone to go with.   
Oh well... I'll find someone.   
   
Friendly Man   
I heard there's a summer festival going on at the shrine. Dammit... I don't have anyone to go with.   
Well, I'm sure it wouldn't be that much fun anyway.   
   
Friendly Man   
Oh yeah, there was that summer festival, huh? Dammit... I didn't have anyone to go with.   
Oh well. It probably wasn't that great.   
   
Friendly Man   
Did you know the wiring here was in bad shape?   
We just barely squeaked by during some big events.   
The weird thing is it's fixed now, but nobody ever called maintenance...   
   
Friendly Man   
I heard a Gekkoukan student died in a fight at that spot.   
I could have told anyone that place was trouble! I swear, man!   
I knew something bad was gonna happen there one of these days!   
   
Friendly Man   
Gekkoukan's chairman fell from the observatory while stargazing, right?   
Doesn't something about that picture strike you as odd...?   
What do you think?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's not odd to me.   
Maybe...   
   
Friendly Man   
Maybe he liked stars so much he... fell trying to reach for them? I don't know, man...   
   
Friendly Man   
But if it's a lie, it must be to cover something up, huh?   
That's crazy, man! It's just like a movie!   
   
Friendly Man   
Dude, check out my arm. Whenever I feel something "off," I get goosebumps...   
I get 'em when I'm just walking down the street.   
Isn't this town weird, man?   
   
Friendly Man   
Dude, this town is filthy! No joke!   
Especially those posters! I keep seeing those damn cultists putting them up!   
Why don't you go dance, man? You'll feel a little better.

This station is the gateway to Tatsumi Port Island.   
The building's pretty modern. There's also a monorail with an incredible ocean view.   
The students who commute to Gekkoukan High sure are lucky.

The best thing about this station is its size, and how close it is to the ocean. We're proud of it.   
I personally like it a lot. What about you?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I love it.   
It's fine.   
I'm not a fan.   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
Wonderful! I'm glad you like it.   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
Well, the more often you come here, the more it'll grow on you.   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
I see... I'm a little disappointed to hear you can't grasp the beauty of this station.   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
This station plaza has a modern design, and space for many different stores.   
Please abide by the station rules and refrain from littering.   
I'm the one who has to clean it up...   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
There are lots of weird people out there now. I heard it's the Apathy Syndrome victims...   
They keep walking in front of the trains and stopping them from moving.   
I'd hate to see one of them jump in front of a moving train...   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
Even I don't understand what's going on here.   
Right at the stroke of midnight, that train appeared right behind the other one.   
Huh? You're glad there wasn't an accident? You kids are so naive, I'm jealous...   
Because of this incident, the company's stock went down... And my salary went down with it.   
If I ever find the culprit, I'm going to throw him from the train into the ocean!   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
Recently... this girl has started coming around here...   
She wears this white dress with this puffy lace...   
I don't know what kind of fashion that is, but... it's not my style.   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
If you go down the side street, you'll come to a spot where gangs gather.   
They always leave garbage behind and spray graffiti all over the walls.   
And every time, I'm the one who has to clean it up.   
I'm going to catch those gangs someday and make them clean it up themselves...   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
Every year during the rainy season, a lot of umbrellas are left in the lost and found.   
The lost and found box is full almost instantly, and I have to take care of it, and...   
Rainy days are depressing.   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
This station is near the high school, so I often see Gekkoukan students and their friends.   
You seem to be alone a lot... Do you have any friends?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I have plenty.   
I wish I did, but...   
I don't need friends.   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
Great! I wish I'd had some friends when I was in school...   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
I suggest you make friends now. The longer you wait in life, the harder it'll be.   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
Well, that's depressing. Do what you want, I suppose.   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
This couple started a fight the other day with a bouquet of flowers...   
Just like in the movies, the girl was whacking the guy over and over with the bouquet.   
Now I get nervous every time I see someone buy a bouquet down there and then walk over here...   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
During summer vacation, this place is so quiet, since there aren't any students rushing onto the train.   
I like the quiet...   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
There's always more trouble around that spot during summer vacation...   
Well, whatever they do, I just don't want them to do it over here.   
As long as they stay on their side, I don't give a damn what they do.   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
School started again... The students have been fun to watch this term.   
All those kids trying to look good after vacation but can't pull it off...   
Inside, I just smile at them and laugh.   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
There's a giant typhoon approaching, it seems.   
If the rain gets too strong, the railways will be shut down, so please keep that in mind.   
Though I don't think anyone would go out in that kind of weather...   
I know I don't want to come to work on days like that.   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
The other day, I saw a young man who was... a little different.   
He seemed about the age to be in high school, and he was throwing a ball up and down.   
Do high school students still play with those kinds of toys?   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
I know you've heard it before, but there seem to be more of those... weird people all the time.   
I'm just worried they'll stop the trains, or something terrible.   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
A Gekkoukan student was killed, huh...?   
So those gangs at that spot are capable of murder...   
*sigh* It's dangerous, being a station attendant here...   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
After that incident, a lot of customers have been glancing over at that gang spot.   
Well, I don't blame them.   
Who knows? Any of us might be the next victim of gang violence.   
I'm feeling worried myself...   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
I was surprised to hear about Mr. Kirijo.   
Since the Kirijo Group has a stake in this company, I'm worried about the future.   
Though to tell you the truth, as long as I don't lose my job, I don't really care what happens.   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
Those people in town are like statues.   
But since they don't stop the trains or cause any trouble...   
I prefer them to the gangs at that spot.   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
I run into more couples at the end of the year than the beginning of the year.   
You got anyone you like to spend time with?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, I've got a girl.   
I'll hook up eventually.   
I'm a loner.   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
Good for you!   
Me, I'm a loner...   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
You should get on it now. Time waits for no man!   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
Wow, that's a surprise. I didn't think there were any left... Well, do what you will.   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
People's manners are getting even worse these days.   
They litter, argue, fight, and people are starting to get hurt.   
And I'm the one who has to field all the complaints as a result.   
It's getting on my nerves...   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
People's manners aren't very good anymore. The train and the plaza are both filthy.   
Everything around me gets worse and worse... I don't know if it'll ever return to normal.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It will.   
Me neither...   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
You think so? What makes you say that?   
Well, maybe I shouldn't be so downhearted.   
   
Earnest Station Worker   
You too, huh? I tell you, I can't take this anymore...   
Maybe I should quit my job and start following that cult.

Earnest Station Worker - MSG_000_0_0   
Oh yeah, those Apathy Syndrome people disappeared.   
I wonder why...   
Well, I don't really care as long as the trains run on time.

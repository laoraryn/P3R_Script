Frowning Man   
There's a bar by the gang spot with the best cocktails around.   
But now they're looking into making non-alcoholic cocktails.   
It used to be a bar where adults could drink in peace... Now it'll be swarming with kids.   
   
Frowning Man   
There's a mahjong parlor by the gang spot, and one of the guys there is a mahjong demon.   
He said, "Let me test my luck," and challenged me to a game.   
I came pretty close, man...   
If I'd gotten the Peacock, I could've beat him...

I-It's so nice out today... Feels like springtime's arrived.

Doesn't it? The cherry blossoms at Gekkoukan High were in full bloom... Though they seemed to have flowered a bit late this year.

Th-The weather is nice today...   
   
Calm Woman   
Yeah. It is, isn't it?   
   
Shy Man   
H-How's your club going?   
   
Calm Woman   
Eh, not bad.   
   
Shy Man   
D-Do you think I could become a first-stringer...?   
   
Calm Woman   
Sure. If you work hard, I think you can make it.   
   
Shy Man   
I-It's getting hot outside, huh?   
   
Calm Woman   
Yeah. Summer's almost here.   
   
Shy Man   
Th-The weather is nice... The sky is blue, and there's a cool breeze...   
   
Calm Woman   
Yeah. The sky's pretty.   
   
Shy Man   
Th-There are a lot of weirdos out there... It's creepy, huh...?   
   
Calm Woman   
Yeah, it's pretty creepy.   
   
Shy Man   
W-We couldn't go to the beach, but... how about the mountains?   
I-It'll be autumn pretty soon, so the leaves will turn red...   
   
Calm Woman   
Yeah, that'll be nice.   
   
Shy Man   
Th-Thanks for looking at my report...   
I-I'd like to take you to...   
No, wait! I-I take that ba—   
   
   
Calm Woman   
Sure! Anywhere is fine with me.   
   
Shy Man   
I-It's getting cold, huh? It's almost winter...   
   
Calm Woman   
Yup, almost winter indeed.   
   
Shy Man   
I'm really worried...   
We're spending so much time together... But I feel like it can't last.   
Is it just me...?   
   
Calm Woman   
Yeah, it's just you.   
This will never end...

It's been a year, huh...? That was fast...   
Nothing's really happened with us in that year...   
*sigh*   
   
Calm Woman - MSG_000_0_0   
The year went by quickly.   
It's true that nothing's changed the past year, but I'm not too worried about that.   
He's just a straightforward kind of guy, and that's the way I like him!

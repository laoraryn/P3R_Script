Short-Haired Housewife   
Oh my! How did I forget to buy shampoo!?   
   
Talkative Housewife   
No rush. Just wait for the sale.   
Isn't Saturday the sale day at Aohige Pharmacy?   
   
Talkative Housewife   
Aohige Pharmacy has sales on Saturdays, right?   
Today's Saturday... We should stop by there later!   
   
Short-Haired Housewife   
You see Mandragora, the karaoke studio at the top of those stairs?   
I saw someone coming out of there alone. Were they singing alone...?   
   
Talkative Housewife   
Well, it's not that weird... But I bet you'd draw some strange looks from the staff.   
It builds courage, in a way, to do whatever you want, no matter what other people may think.   
   
Short-Haired Housewife   
Last week was my 15th wedding anniversary.   
But my lousy husband didn't give me anything! He didn't even remember it was our anniversary!   
   
Talkative Housewife   
It makes you wonder why we even married them when they pull stuff like that.   
It doesn't take much to make us feel loved. Even a single flower from Rafflesia would do.   
   
Short-Haired Housewife   
Did you hear? That, uh, what was it, the Apathy Syndrome?   
There was a victim at Gekkoukan High. He was friends with my son's senpai.   
   
Talkative Housewife   
A victim in your own neighborhood? Oh my... I guess we can't say it's none of our business now.   
My son's teacher's relative's son's calligraphy teacher caught Apathy Syndrome too.   
   
Short-Haired Housewife   
I'm getting hungry...   
Should we stop somewhere and grab a bite to eat?   
   
Talkative Housewife   
Ooh, let's get some of Octopia's takoyaki!   
It's at the Iwatodai strip mall, so we'll have to take the monorail.   
   
Short-Haired Housewife   
I heard from my son that there's this freaky website on the Internet.   
Apparently, you can have someone carry out revenge for you.   
   
Talkative Housewife   
They have online revenge agents now!?   
I don't know much about computers, but that sounds terrifying...   
   
Short-Haired Housewife   
I get tired of coming up with new things to cook for dinner.   
My family always complains when I end up making something similar to what they had for lunch.   
   
Talkative Housewife   
My friend told me that, one time, her kid who goes to Gekkoukan bought a pork cutlet sandwich for lunch...   
And when she made him pork cutlet for dinner, he yelled at her...   
She told him, "Well, you should've bought some sweet pastries or apple strudel instead."   
   
Short-Haired Housewife   
Our kids are off on their summer vacation. I'm exhausted from making their meals every day.   
   
Talkative Housewife   
One of the women in my neighborhood says she precooks massive amounts of udon.   
Then she rotates between sesame dressing, ponzu, and shredded daikon so it always tastes differently.   
I figure we housewives need summer vacation too, so I decided to copy her method.   
   
Short-Haired Housewife   
Don't those kids look strange? That one near the clubhouse... Is he from Gekkoukan?   
They look sort of slack and unmoving... Is he being lazy since it's summer vacation?   
   
Talkative Housewife   
One of the women in my neighborhood has a kid who goes to Gekkoukan...   
But she's energetic and sweet—very different from those kids.   
   
Short-Haired Housewife   
My son became nocturnal over summer vacation.   
He wakes up in the afternoon, leaves at night, and usually doesn't come back until sunrise.   
   
Talkative Housewife   
Where do they go that late at night? That Escapade club?   
The security is too lax at those kinds of places. I heard they don't even care if a high school student just walks in wearing their uniform.   
   
Short-Haired Housewife   
I think the hot summer sun got to me...   
See? My arms are burned and my skin is all rough.   
   
Talkative Housewife   
Do you know the ramen restaurant Hagakure at the Iwatodai strip mall?   
The ramen they sell there has plenty of collagen to boost your beauty! That's what I heard, anyway.   
If you make your skin more youthful, I bet your mind will follow, and your husband will love you more!   
   
Short-Haired Housewife   
A woman in my neighborhood said part of her roof was destroyed by the typhoon.   
No matter how much we try to prevent disasters, there's no way we can completely guard against them...   
   
Talkative Housewife   
Well, I don't know. You can't trust those building contractors, you know.   
It could be that her house was just made of cheap, non-regulation materials.   
   
Short-Haired Housewife   
That kid in front of the club bothers me... He's so motionless.   
He's from Gekkoukan, right? It's been a while since the second term started.   
   
Talkative Housewife   
I understand how relaxed they are since autumn has just begun...   
But they seem too relaxed to me.   
   
Short-Haired Housewife   
I was thinking of having my older son take the Gekkoukan entrance exam, but...   
I don't want him to go to a dangerous school. Maybe I should reconsider...   
   
Talkative Housewife   
You mean the Gekkoukan student who was caught up in that fight? He died, right?   
I feel sorry for him... He was too young to die. How could that have happened?   
   
Short-Haired Housewife   
The other day, my husband was saying that he's regained that passion he once had in his youth...   
It's quite suspicious... I wonder if he's cheating on me...   
   
Talkative Housewife   
Maybe he just went to Be Blue V. You know, that healing shop next to the police station.   
They say going there can help you remember things you've long forgotten.   
We should go there sometime too!   
   
Short-Haired Housewife   
H-Hey... Those motionless kids near the club...   
Are they... Are they the ones with that Apathy Syndrome everyone is talking about?   
   
Talkative Housewife   
Oh, you're worrying too much. Aren't they just relaxing?   
Although... they have been like that for a while. Are they going to stay there forever...?   
   
Short-Haired Housewife   
I heard the head of the Kirijo Group passed away...   
His young daughter is all alone in the world now. He must regret having to leave her so early.   
   
Talkative Housewife   
Well, officially, his death was due to illness. But judging by the way the man looked...   
I think it might have been foul play. Maybe he was involved in organized crime...   
   
Short-Haired Housewife   
Your daughter is looking so confident lately. She came over to say hi to me, and I didn't recognize her.   
Is she getting married? Or did she just get a boyfriend?   
   
Talkative Housewife   
Oh, it's nothing like that... Do you see the Chagall Café next to the club?   
My daughter said that just drinking their coffee makes you more charming. It's pheromones, or something...   
   
Short-Haired Housewife   
My son isn't stressed at all, even with exams coming up... I'm a little worried about him.   
Do you know the Wilduck Burger at the Iwatodai strip mall? He's trying something new on the menu every day.   
   
Talkative Housewife   
Is that the place that uses the mysterious ingredients? I doubt they'd use anything inedible...   
But I wouldn't be able to eat there. I don't have the courage those kids have to try weird food.   
   
Short-Haired Housewife   
My eldest is having his entrance exams soon. The atmosphere at home is very tense now...   
Even I get tense, remembering the time when I took my own exams...   
   
Talkative Housewife   
I took my kid to the Iwatodai strip mall and we had lunch together at Wakatsu.   
My husband saw an ad for them that talked about omega-3s making you smarter or something...   
I don't know if my kid got smarter from eating the meal, but she did pass the exam.   
   
Short-Haired Housewife   
Did you see the news? Some thug broke into the hall where the university testing is held...   
My eldest is entering high school next month... I'm worried.   
   
Talkative Housewife   
My neighbor's son was apparently taking the test then...   
He said the man was screaming "Nyx" or something with a crazed look on his face...   
   
Short-Haired Housewife   
You know how that cult is spreading all over the country now?   
D-Do you think there are cultists in this mall right now...?   
   
Talkative Housewife   
My neighbor's kid was approached by one of them too, something about "the Fall"...   
I-I think there really might be some cultists here... The people around us look suspicious...

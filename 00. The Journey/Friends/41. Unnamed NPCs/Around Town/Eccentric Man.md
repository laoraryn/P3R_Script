Hmm...   
...Hey, you there. This may seem sudden, but do you want to be Santa?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Santa?   
What do you mean?   
   
Eccentric Man   
Well, just between you and me... I'm THE Santa who makes kids' wishes come true on Christmas!   
...Well, you can't really tell when I'm dressed like this.   
I'm actually looking for someone to help me with my merry duties right now.   
It's a special job, but we're always short on staff... What do you say? Want to give it a try?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'll do it.   
No thanks.   
   
Eccentric Man   
Great! Let's get on with it. ...But first, one question for you.   
Can you show me proof that you've done something good for the world?   
   
Eccentric Man   
I see... If you ever change your mind, you know where to find me.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Something good I've done for the world...   
If I rescue someone from   
somewhere dangerous, maybe   
he'll acknowledge my deed...   
   
Eccentric Man   
Well then, I'll be waiting.

Eccentric Man   
Hm? Is there something you want to show me?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I showed the person claiming   
to be Santa a thank-you letter.   
   
Eccentric Man   
I see... So you rescued a missing person...!   
Putting yourself on the line to help others is not something everyone can do.   
Fantastic... You pass the test! Here, take this.   
   
Eccentric Man   
Congratulations, you're now a certified Santa! Apprentices only get the hat, though.   
So, right off the bat, here's your first task: deliver this to someone who needs it.   
   
Eccentric Man   
This year's work is pretty much taken care of already. You can start working hard for next year.   
Well, I'll see you when the time comes. Merry Christmas!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Come to think of it, I received a thank-you   
letter from a missing person I rescued...   
   
Eccentric Man

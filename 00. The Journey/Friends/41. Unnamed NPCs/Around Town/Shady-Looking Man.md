Oh, are you interested in these Max Safety Shoes?   
You have good taste! I can sell them to you for a reasonable price.   
Let's say... How about just 20,000 yen?

Woohoo, lucky me! ...Wait, you ain't got enough money...   
Listen, I can't lower the price any more. If you want 'em, you gotta have the money for 'em.

The hell? You're wastin' my time...   
If you don't need nothin', then get outta here. I'm a busy man!

Still need something? Sorry, kid, but I'm busy.   
   
Shady-Looking Man   
Hm, you need something? I'm busy getting ready to sell shoes.

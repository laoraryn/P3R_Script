Aigis   
Koromaru-san seems to be enjoying himself.   
He's able to go on cherished walks together with his friends...   
   
Aigis   
This must be where the summer festival I have heard about will be held.   
For what reason is it required to equip oneself with this "yukata"...?   
I would like to infiltrate the site tomorrow to investigate this matter further.   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Aigis   
Welcome back, Koromaru-san. Hm? You seem to be holding something.   
   
Aigis   
He wants you to have this. Perhaps it was part of his secret stash.   
Shall we return to the dorm? Let us come again, Koromaru-san.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All right, buddy, go wild!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Even after nightfall it's still pretty hot out...   
I guess this'll be my last high school summer vacation... Not that it means much to me.   
I do have some lingering regrets, though.   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Haha... You always seem like you have a good time when we come here.   
Hm? Did you pick something up out there?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Oh, right. This was your home, wasn't it? I guess we should hold onto this.   
Well, wanna go back?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yo, Koromaru. You wag that tail any harder and it might just fly off.   
Don't wear yourself out, okay?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Man, today was pretty sweet, huh?   
Happy - After a movie like that, I walk out ready to take on the world!   
I'm glad the girl was able to figure him out in the end.   
Having to play hero without anyone ever knowing just seems way too frustrating...   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, hey! What's up? You feelin' hungry or something?   
Wait, what? What's that you got there, buddy?   
   
Junpei Iori   
The heck is this? Hey, don't go puttin' weird stuff in your mouth...   
Maybe he really is hungry. Let's feed him as soon as we get back.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Hehe... Koro-chan looks so happy.   
I guess this is where he's lived his whole life until now. Maybe it brings back memories for him.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - It was fun going to the movies, wasn't it? I'm glad I went.   
I'm thinking about putting together my own movie marathon now...   
I'll rent DVDs of all the movies I missed out on, and watch them all back-to-back.   
Happy - I'm getting excited just thinking about it. It's the kind of thing you can only do on summer vacation.   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Koro-chan, you've got mud all over you!   
...Huh? What's that you have in your mouth?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Could this be your way of thanking us for taking you here? Hehe... Well, isn't that nice?   
I suppose it's about time we head back... Koro-chan, let's take a bath when we get home.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Whenever we bring Koromaru here, he appears to thoroughly enjoy himself...   
I suppose it's like returning to his hometown.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I know I said a lot of things earlier, but now that I've had time to calm down and think it over...   
I do see the charm in the movies we watched today.   
...Perhaps it isn't in character for me to say such things.   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What's the matter? Are you done here already?   
Hm? Koromaru, are you holding something?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Where did you find something like this...? Well, no matter. I suppose we should hold onto it.   
Let's start heading back. Come along, Koromaru.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Quit getting so excited. Don't you go on walks all the time?   
Whatever... Go on and run all you want.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
I don't like the way things are lookin' out there... Feels like a storm's coming.   
......   
Well... whatever happens, happens.   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
What, you done already? This place was your home, right?   
Hm? Whatcha got there?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Doesn't look like anything dangerous. Why don't you hang on to it?   
C'mon, let's head back.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Well, aren't you happy today...   
The pooch must've been worried 'cause you were sick so long, Arisato.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
I ain't tryin' to nag, but don't take your health for granted.   
That special power of yours has been a huge boost to our strength.   
And it's no secret that Aki and Kirijo have their hands full with their own problems...   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Oh, you're back.   
Geez, you've been pickin' up some weird stuff...   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
You hungry or something? Fine, I'll fix you up a good meal when we get back.   
Alright. Let's get the hell out of here.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Whew...   
Keeping up with your running pace makes for great training.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
When I was a kid, I found a stray dog...   
But we weren't allowed to have pets at the orphanage.   
......   
Maybe it's because Shinji came back... but I've been thinking about the past a lot recently.   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hey. Welcome back.   
Oh? Does this guy have something in his mouth?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Didn't know they had stuff like this at the shrine... Maybe we should try looking for some next time.   
Anyway, it's time we start heading back. Let's go for a run again sometime, Koromaru.   
   
Aigis   
As usual, I observe no abnormalities in Koromaru-san's physical or mental status today.   
......   
May I have a moment of your time, Minato-san? There is something I wish to speak with you about.   
   
Aigis   
I was performing research today, and came across a puzzling piece of information.   
It stated that there is a specific time of year in which one can reunite with the dead.   
It appears as though "spirits" return to the living realm during this time.   
What exactly does this mean?   
Once an organism comes to the end of its lifespan, its physical body will deteriorate...   
But does this mean that there is a "spirit" that exists independent of one's physical form?   
Sad - And in that case... would that mean that Aragaki-san is...?   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Aigis   
Welcome back, Koromaru-san. Hm? What are you holding?   
   
Aigis   
It appears as though he wishes us to have it. Why don't we gratefully accept?   
Now, let's return to the dorm, shall we?   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - I finally caught up...   
You're too fast, Koromaru... Don't go running at top speed like that...   
My legs aren't long enough...   
Um, Arisato-san... Is it all right if I rest a bit?   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Um... I wanted to apologize.   
Sad - For causing so much trouble... And making everyone worry about me...   
Sad - I... lost something very precious.   
But in exchange... I gained something just as important...   
That's why I think I'll be all right on my own now.   
Thank you for bringing me along today.   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Oh, there you are! Guess it's about time...   
...Huh? Looks like Koromaru's got something.   
   
Ken Amada   
Wonder what this is.   
I'm curious where it came from, but... it's getting late. We should head back.   
All right, this time I'm not gonna lose! Let's go, Koromaru!   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - I did it! I won today...   
Sad - Oh man, it's hot...   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - We're close... It's almost time for the final battle.   
......   
We can do this. Right, Leader?   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Ken Amada   
Yeah, we'll do it together!   
...Huh? Did you pick something up again?   
   
Ken Amada   
Wonder what this is... You didn't eat anything strange, did you, Koromaru?   
I'll have to remember to brush your teeth when we get back. Let's go, Arisato-san.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Whew, I'm beat... You're too fast for me, Koro-chan...   
I bet you're having fun, though... All right, knock yourself out!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I wonder if Koro-chan's as psyched up as I am.   
......   
There's only two days left...   
I'm feeling pretty anxious about it.   
......   
Everything'll work out, I'm sure...   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Oh, welcome back! You sure are as playful as always...   
...Hm? What's that you got there?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Wow, you found something good! You've got quite an eye there, Koro-chan.   
Happy - Haha, you look pretty pleased with yourself.   
Happy - Well, then... Why don't we head back?   
   
Ken Amada   
Looks like Koromaru's really happy to see you. You guys have been gone for a while...   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - You guys must have had a lot of fun on the trip.   
You've all been talking about it non-stop when we hang out in the lounge.   
Koromaru and I were the only ones left behind at the dorm, so it was really quiet during that time.   
I can't remember the last time I spent so many nights without hearing a peep.   
I stayed up late watching TV with Koromaru in the lounge... Then I'd doze off for a while...   
But it was actually so quiet, I couldn't sleep right.   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Ken Amada   
Hm? What's the matter?   
I think there's something he wants to give you, Arisato-san.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Heh... I feel like I've been able to tell what Koromaru's thinking lately.   
Happy - It's probably because we spent so much time alone together these past few days.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Hehe... Koro-chan's as happy as ever, no matter how cold it is.   
Happy - We'll be right here, so go play all you want, okay?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um, Arisato-kun...   
A shrine may be an odd place to bring something like this up, but...   
Do you... have any plans for Christmas?   
Um, assuming you're free, of course...   
Sad - ......   
Sad - I-I have some preparations to make...   
Sad - So, um...   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh! Welcome back.   
Hm? What's that in your mouth, Koro-chan?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hmm, I wonder where he keeps finding all this...   
Surprised - Oh no, Koro-chan! Your butt's all dusty now!   
Happy - I guess we should take a bath together again... Hehe. Let's head back.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Hehe... Koro-chan's as happy as ever, no matter how cold it is.   
Happy - We'll be right here, so go play all you want, okay?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Recently, I found a recipe for a cake that you can bake with nothing but a microwave.   
You know, since it's almost Christmas.   
I wanted to try making something to get in the spirit of things...   
And depending on the ingredients I use, I might even be able to give some to Koro-chan.   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh! Welcome back.   
...Huh? He's holding something in his mouth.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hmm, I wonder where he keeps finding all this...   
Surprised - Oh no, Koro-chan! Your butt's all dusty now!   
Happy - I guess we should take a bath together again... Hehe. Let's head back.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Koromaru always looks happy when he comes here...   
Perhaps I'll make this a regular stop on my own walks.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
So... It may not be appropriate to mention this, but...   
Sad - ......   
Sad - It's... almost Christmas, so...   
Sad - I mean...   
Do you...   
Sad - ......   
...Never mind. Forget I said anything.   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Welcome back.   
Hm...? Did you pick something up again?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Ah, I was wondering what it could be... It seems you've got quite an eye for beauty, Koromaru.   
Well, I suppose it is getting rather cold. Let's start heading back.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Koromaru always looks happy when he comes here...   
Perhaps I'll make this a regular stop on my own walks.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...I notice many people become restless when this time of year rolls around.   
But I suppose that sentiment isn't exactly top of mind among the members of our dorm.   
Happy - You know... when I was younger, I was actually quite fond of the holiday season.   
Every year, as the big day grew close, I would write a letter to Santa Claus.   
And then, on Christmas morning, I would find his response. It filled me with such wonder and joy.   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Ah... Welcome back.   
Hm...? Did you pick something up again?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Ah, I was wondering what it could be... It seems you've got quite an eye for beauty, Koromaru.   
Well, I suppose it is getting rather cold. Let's start heading back.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Koro-chan always looks so happy when we're on break. Maybe it's because everyone's all together.   
Happy - Okay, Koro-chan! Go run to your heart's content!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, so... weird question, but...   
You do know what day tomorrow is, right?   
Sad - I'm... gonna have something ready, just in case. So, you know... if you have time...   
Sad - Well...   
Happy - I-I'll tell you the rest tomorrow!   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Oh, there you are.   
...And you've got something again, don't you? Is that an early Christmas present for us?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Koro-chan, were you digging around again? Your nose is all dirty.   
C'mere. Let's get you cleaned up before we go home.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Koro-chan always looks so happy when we're on break. Maybe it's because everyone's all together.   
Happy - Hehe, go run to your heart's content!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It's almost Christmas, isn't it?   
I usually do a holiday party every year with my club members.   
Sad - But to be honest, I dunno if I'd be in the mood for something like that this year...   
Guess I shouldn't be such a downer though, huh?   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, there you are.   
...And you've got something again, don't you? Is that an early Christmas present for us?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Koro-chan, were you digging around again? Your nose is all dirty.   
C'mere. Let's get you cleaned up before we go home.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Hooooooly crap, it's cold out here. Hey Koromaru, mind lending me your fur coat?   
   
Junpei Iori   
So, you make up your mind yet?   
You don't have to tell me now... Just saying, the day's gettin' close.   
......   
So I talked with Fuuka earlier today.   
She's pretty tough. Or, I guess... she got tougher over this past year, huh?   
Talkin' to her was like... that last little shove I needed.   
Girls are tough... And that's no joke.   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Haha, you sayin' you're tough too?   
Happy - Don't worry, dude. Everyone knows you're one tough pup.   
Huh? You've got somethin' weird again, don't you? Lemme see here...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oh, this is...! Yeah, I got no idea. Dude, catch!   
Happy - Alright, let's get our butts warmed up again. To the dorm!   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Hehe... Koromaru-san looks quite happy.   
Happy - We'll wait for you here. Please enjoy yourself as much as you like.   
   
Aigis   
School resumes again tomorrow, doesn't it?   
Happy - I'm actually looking forward to it. I see everything so differently now...   
Happy - If you wouldn't mind, perhaps we could walk home together after classes tomorrow?   
Happy - I'd like to experience the town alongside you, Minato-san...   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Aigis   
Welcome back, Koromaru-san. Hm? What is that you have there?   
   
Aigis   
What's that? You would like to trade this in for a treat? Are you feeling hungry, Koromaru-san?   
Happy - All right, we can get a snack when we get back. But only a small one, understood?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Koromaru's an endless fount of energy... Watching him is soothing, in a way.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Goodness... To think they'd put flyers even in a place like this...   
Did you see all those posters on the way here? There must be hundreds of them.   
Perhaps the temperature isn't the only reason I feel a chill...   
But... our path is set. All that's left is to believe in ourselves and our comrades as we push forward.   
We'll do this together.   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant* Arf!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Oh? Done already?   
Hm? Heh... I see you have something for us again.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Oh... I almost forgot.   
Happy - Thank you for getting me outdoors today.   
Happy - I certainly needed the fresh air.   
Even I feel a little bit nervous when it comes to college entrance exams...   
...I didn't realize we'd been talking for so long. Why don't we head back now?

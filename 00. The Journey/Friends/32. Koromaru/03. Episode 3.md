Looks like Koromaru is out front.   
Should I check up on Koromaru?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Check on Koromaru   
Not now   
   
DEV: Internal MES - MND_002_0_0   
Let's head to where Koromaru is.   
   
-----   
   
   
   
Koromaru   
Arf...?   
   
Koromaru   
Arf?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend some time   
with Koromaru today?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Spend time with Koromaru   
Not now   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Arf!   
   
------   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru's people-watching   
yet again today.   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* Arf!   
   
Gentle Woman   
That voice...   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Gentle Woman   
It really is you, Koromaru! I'm so glad to see you again.   
I was worried when I didn't see you at the shrine gate.   
But here you are, looking better than ever.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf arf! Arf!   
   
Gentle Woman   
And so well-dressed! You've become quite the fashionista, haven't you?   
   
Gentle Woman   
Good boy, good boy.   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Awoo! Awoooo!   
   
Gentle Woman   
Do you live in this dorm?   
Is Koromaru in good hands here?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
We all take care of him.   
He takes care of me.   
It's a give-and-take relationship.   
   
Gentle Woman   
Ah, I thought so.   
By "we," I take it you mean everyone in this dorm looks after him.   
   
Gentle Woman   
Oh, is that so?   
I can see that, actually. Koromaru looks much more grown up now.   
   
Gentle Woman   
Oh, that's just wonderful.   
Hehe, I think I'm a little jealous.   
   
Gentle Woman   
I'm glad you've found somewhere you can relax again.   
   
Koromaru   
Sad - *whine*   
   
Gentle Woman   
Oh, don't you worry about a thing.   
You can live wherever you choose.   
   
Gentle Woman   
I have to get going. Take care, now, the both of you.   
   
Koromaru   
Sad - *whine*   
   
Aigis   
What's wrong, Koromaru-san?   
   
Koromaru   
Sad - *whine*   
   
Aigis   
I see, so that's what's troubling you.   
   
Aigis   
That woman from earlier...   
She offered to take Koromaru-san in at one point.   
But at the time, he still had unfinished business to attend to.   
   
Aigis   
Of course, she is unaware of that fact.   
So in all likelihood...   
She may still carry the wrong impression about Koromaru-san's feelings.   
   
Koromaru   
Sad - *whine*   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru looks regretful...   
We have to make things   
right with that lady.   
   
---   
   
Gentle Woman   
Oh, it's you again.   
Is everything all right?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
How should I tell her about   
Koromaru's true feelings?   
I can't talk about Personas   
or the Dark Hour...   
   
Gentle Woman   
Would this happen to be about Koromaru?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, sort of.   
He had a reason...   
   
Gentle Woman   
Hehe, don't worry about it.   
I know Koromaru has his own reasons and his own problems.   
He's such a sweet, smart boy, isn't he?   
   
Gentle Woman   
Don't worry, I understand.   
Sometimes you don't even need words, right?   
He's such a sweet, smart boy, isn't he?   
   
Gentle Woman   
So really, I'm all right. But thank you for being so thoughtful.   
   
Gentle Woman   
The way he's by your side...   
He looks just like he did when he was with the priest.   
He must really trust you from the bottom of his heart.   
   
Gentle Woman   
Please, take good care of Koromaru.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
We'll always be together.   
I'll look after him till the end.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Looks like Koromaru heard me...   
   
Koromaru   
Ruff!   
   
Gentle Woman   
Koromaru really has been blessed with so many wonderful friends.   
Be sure to cherish them, okay?   
   
Koromaru   
Woof!   
   
Gentle Woman   
You'll be at that dorm from now on, won't you?   
Hehe, well I'll have to visit you again, then.   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant*   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel a strong sense of trust   
coming from Koromaru.   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - *pant* Ruff! Ruff!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I took an overjoyed Koromaru   
on a walk before going home.

Ken Amada   
Thanks for coming. Do you have a moment?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Seems like he was waiting for me...   
Should I spend the evening with Amada?   
   
Ken Amada   
Arisato-san, do you have some time to spare right now?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend the evening with Amada?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Spend time with him   
Not now   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Okay. Let's head out then.   
   
Ken Amada   
I see. Well, next time, I guess, then.

Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Here comes the champ.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Now things are getting exciting! Get 'im, Amada!   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Why are you here?   
My promise was to Amada...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We heard you guys were gonna have a match, so we came to witness it.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - These kinds of things need an audience, don't you think?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Scheming - We heard you two were going to have a match. We're just here to witness it.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - That's right, we're here to watch the little dude shine.   
   
Ken Amada   
When I told them I wanted to beat you, they all offered to help.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I set up a training routine for him, and gave him advice on his movements.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - I also wanted to build my legs and core, so I've been going on runs with Koromaru.   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Arf!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - And I took on the role of bein' you for practice matches.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We figured if he couldn't land a hit on Junpei, then beating you would be out of the question.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Wha— Hey, spare a thought for the guy covered in bruises over here!   
Sad - Man, he really didn't hold back anything on me...   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - Well then... Let's do this!   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - Hyaaa!   
   
Junpei Iori (SE)   
Whoaaa!   
   
Akihiko Sanada (SE)   
Hmm...   
   
Koromaru (SE)   
*whimper*   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - *pant* *pant*   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - You're doin' good, Amada! Keep it up!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - You can do this, just take it half a step further!   
   
Koromaru   
Woof, woof!   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - Yah!   
   
Junpei Iori (SE)   
Whoa!   
   
Akihiko Sanada (SE)   
...!   
   
Koromaru (SE)   
Woof...!   
   
Ken Amada   
Hurt - Ngh...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Crap, did he get hit!?   
   
Koromaru   
Bark, bark!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - The next one's coming, get up!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You're finished.   
No hard feelings.   
   
Yukari's Voice   
Hey, are you guys up there?   
   
Yukari's Voice   
[cut 8 2 0]   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - Haah!   
   
Junpei Iori (SE)   
Ahhhhhh!   
   
Akihiko Sanada (SE)   
Oh...!?   
   
Koromaru (SE)   
Arf...!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Aw, yeah! That's a clean hit! The winner is Amada, in the blue corner!   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Arf! Arf!   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - I just got lucky. Plus, I did kind of cheat...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - No, you saw a window of opportunity and you took it. That's something to be proud of.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Fuuka and I bought some roasted sweet potatoes. I was looking for everyone to come eat with us, but...   
Exasperated* - What are you guys doing up here anyway?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Scheming - We're witnessing a showdown between men. Right, Amada?   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - It sounds kinda weird when you put it like that... But yeah, I guess so.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - It was a great match, on both sides.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Huh...?   
Happy - I don't really get it, but it sounds like you're having fun. It's cold though, so you should head inside soon.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oh wait, did you say sweet potatoes!? Count me in!   
   
Yukari Takeba (SE)   
I bought them for Amada-kun! Junpei, you can have the skin and the burnt parts.   
   
Junpei Iori (SE)   
Hey! What am I, a dog?   
   
Koromaru (SE)   
Arf!   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Thanks for the match, Arisato-san. I learned a lot from it.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You were great.   
I let my guard down.   
Let's do one more round...   
   
Ken Amada   
No, I just got lucky. I was stuck on the defensive that whole time.   
Happy - But I think I did do better than our last fight. Now, I just need to apply this to a real battle...   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - It was just luck. I was stuck on the defensive that whole time.   
Happy - Guess I still have a long way to go. You really are amazing.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - If we do one more round, I'll definitely lose.   
I just got lucky. You really are amazing.   
   
Ken Amada   
Technically, we're tied one-to-one now, so the next match decides the real winner... Not sure I actually have a chance though.   
Happy - But I hope you'll let me challenge you again some time. You gotta promise, okay?   
   
Ken Amada   
Okay. Then until that time comes, will you hold on to this for me?   
   
Ken Amada   
That's... the key to the house I lived in with my mom.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Whenever I look at it, I remember the time I spent with her.   
Sad - That house is filled with all kinds of memories we shared together...   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - I know the final battle isn't going to be easy.   
Angry - But no matter what, I want to come back here.   
I feel like this key will connect us to each other.   
   
Ken Amada   
And I hope someday... maybe I can be that person someone can always come back to.   
Just like how Mom, and everyone at the dorm, was there for me.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - ...Ah, sorry for talking for so long. Shall we go down and have some sweet potatoes?   
   
Ken Amada   
So our next match would be next year? Or maybe even longer than that...   
Happy - I know! How about once I reach the same height as you?   
And if we're around the same build, I might stand a chance. Oh, but you'll probably be even stronger by then...   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - When that time comes, I wonder what everyone will be like.   
Happy - It's exciting just thinking about it!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Amada was beaming with happiness   
as we went to join the others.

You have forged a powerful bond with Amada! You can now fuse **Michael**, the protector of all!

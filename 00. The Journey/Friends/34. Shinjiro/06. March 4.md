Have you seen this photo before?   
There's Sanada-senpai, Kirijo-senpai, and...   
And that one student who passed away last year in an incident, um... Aragaki-senpai?

They all look so young, so maybe this is from when they started high school? I wonder if Aragaki-senpai also used to live in the dorms.   
I always thought he looked kinda scary, but in this picture...   
Happy - He seems so kind. It's a really nice picture.

It's a photo of Sanada,   
Mitsuru, and Aragaki...

......   
It seems like Aragaki is smiling faintly...

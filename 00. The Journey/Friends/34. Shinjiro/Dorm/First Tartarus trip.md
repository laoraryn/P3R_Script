Hey.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
So you're the one that decides the battle formation.   
...I wanna get back into the swing of things as quickly as possible.   
You get what I'm sayin', right?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Noted.   
No promises.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...Alright.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Well, I ain't gonna force you.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
This place is just as creepy as I remember...   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Well, I'm here if you need me.

Hello.   
Please excuse me for contacting you without notice.   
I don't mean to impose, but I wonder if I could trouble you to meet after school...?   
I'll be in front of the student council room. I hope it's not an inconvenience.   
Thank you.

Hello.   
   
   
Good afternoon. It's Fushimi.   
Forgive me for asking for help so suddenly, but do you have time to meet me after school?   
I'll be at the usual spot in the hallway, but it's not a problem if you can't make it.   
Thank you.

Good afternoon.   
I hope my messaging you on such short notice hasn't been an issue. I appreciate the time you've been able to spare.   
Would you be able to go somewhere with me after school? Anywhere is fine.   
I'll be waiting in the hall again.   
Thank you.

I have a favor to ask.   
   
   
Hello, Arisato-san.   
I wanted to ask this of you in person, but couldn't summon the courage this time...   
Could I borrow your attention after classes? There's something I'd like to talk to you about.   
I'll be in front of the student council room, as usual.   
Thank you.

Hello :)   
   
   
Good afternoon, Arisato-san.   
Your advice the other day was greatly appreciated. Although I don't have anything to give you in return, I hope to one day return the favor.   
I think I've finally gotten used to messaging you.   
Would you like to walk home together? :)

Sorry *sweatdrop*   
   
   
Arisato-san, hello.   
I hope this doesn't come at an inconvenient time for you.   
I'm in need of a favor. Could you meet me at the usual spot?   
Sorry for always asking for your help... But I truly appreciate it.   
-Fushimi :)

Hello!   
   
   
Good afternoon.   
Another sudden request. Sorry.   
Do you have time to help me study?   
I'm thinking about that illustration collection and am having trouble concentrating. I feel like having you around would help me to focus.   
It'd be great to see you~   
-Fushimi :)   
   
-----   
   
Please help... *sweatdrop*   
   
   
Sorry, Arisato-san.   
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm feeling very on edge. That's not unusual for me, but it's gotten so bad lately that I'm having trouble eating.   
I keep worrying about what everyone is saying... But when I'm with you, that feeling goes away.   
I hope I'm not bothering you.

Arisato-san    
   
   
Hi~   
I should be used to messaging you by now, but I'm still nervous typing this. *sweatdrop*   
Would it be all right if I asked you to go out with me?   
I really want to see you...   
   
-----   
   
What should I do?   
   
   
Between glares from classmates and whispers from strangers, I worry I won't be able to repair my reputation.   
No one seems to care about what the truth really is. I can't help but think this would go away if I left school outright.   
I need to think this through...   
Will you walk home with me?   
   
-----   
   
Hi there    
   
   
Arisato-san,   
Thank you so much for the other day. And please thank the president of the student council for me, too. :)   
When you have some time, there's something I'd like to discuss with you. Let me know when you're free~

Hello, Arisato-san.   
Are you available to meet me today?

Dear Arisato-san.   
   
   
I hope I'm not disturbing your afternoon.   
Do you have time to meet?   
   
-----   
   
Hello.   
   
   
I'm sorry to keep asking this way, but do you have some time to spare for me?   
I'll be waiting to hear from you.   
   
-----   
   
Sorry to bother you.   
   
   
Hello! It's Fushimi.   
Would you like to go somewhere together?   
Sorry for the short notice. If you have some time and are interested, please let me know before the end of the afternoon.   
Thank you.

It's too hot *sweatdrop*   
   
   
Hello! It's Fushimi.   
It seems that summer vacation is coming to a close.   
I've acquired some tickets for a movie showing today. It's a bit of a tragedy, but it features some very charismatic acting performances...   
Would you like to go together?   
   
-----   
   
If possible...   
   
   
Hello.   
It's still so hot every day.    
Do you know about the festival tonight at Naganaki Shrine?   
If you were planning to go, I would love to go together. It would be nice to make some last summer memories with you.   
Please let me know what you think.   
   
-----   
   
Plans for Christmas?   
   
   
The end of the year swept in so quickly.   
We've made very pleasant memories this year, and I was hoping to make one more before this chapter comes to a close.   
I'm very grateful to have met you, Arisato-san. Would you like to spend Christmas together...?

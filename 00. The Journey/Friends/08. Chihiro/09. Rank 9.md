Chihiro Fushimi   
Looking away - ......   
   
School PA   
...Attention please.   
   
School PA   
Fushimi-san of Class 1-C... Arisato-san of Class 2-F...   
The student council president would like to speak with you. Please report to the student council room immediately.   
I repeat...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Surprised - The president wants to speak with me...?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Looking away - D-Don't tell me she thinks I stole the money too!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Don't worry, she'll help us.   
Mitsuru's not like that.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Y-Yes, you're right! She'll help us, won't she?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - And if I talk to her, at least I won't have to trouble you anymore, Arisato-san...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Surprised - Oh? "Mitsuru"...?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Surprised - O-Oh, I see! I didn't realize you two knew each other so well.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
...Um, shall we head to the student council room then?   
   
---   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Good, you're both here.   
I apologize for the sudden announcement. The reason I called you here is—   
   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - It's because people are saying I stole money, isn't it?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yes, that's right. I happened to overhear the rumors.   
First, I'd like to hear from you directly on whether you actually did it or not.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Looking away - Uh... Um... Miss President, I... I...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - ......   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Chihiro is innocent.   
You need to tell her yourself.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Arisato-san...   
Sad - No, I can't keep doing this. I need to stand up for myself...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Arisato-san...   
Okay, I can do this... I just need to be brave.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - I... Uh... I...   
Sad - I didn't do it...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Chihiro's lips are trembling.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Well, I thought as much.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Surprised - You... believe me?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Considering all the work you've been doing for the student council, I can't imagine you'd be the type to steal.   
I fully expected it to be nothing but a baseless rumor. I just wanted to hear it directly from you.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Miss President... Th-Thank you so much...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That said, we can't expect everyone else to be as understanding.   
As you have seen, people are openly sullying your reputation because they don't know you as well as we do.   
I'll figure something out for the time being. That's my duty as the student council president.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Give me a hand, will you, Arisato?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Why me?   
All right.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'd like your opinion on how to proceed.   
You've spent more time with Fushimi, so you understand her situation much better than I do.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I wish I could handle this right away, but I have other business to take care of...   
You don't have plans tonight, do you? Come to my room when you're available.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
And I'd prefer you try not to be seen by anyone.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Surprised - W-Wait! D-Does that... Does that mean...   
Surprised - You two will be... meeting alone...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Alone...? I'm not sure I understand the problem.   
If too many people get involved, it could draw unwanted attention.   
The two of us can handle this, so you—   
   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Angry - N-No! I can't allow that!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Fushimi?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Angry - All I have to do is clear my name, right?   
Angry - I... I can do something about it on my own!   
Angry - I'm going to demand an explanation from the teacher!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Um... M-Miss President, I...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I understand you must be under a lot of stress because of those unfounded rumors. I'm sorry I didn't realize it sooner.   
Leave the rest to us, Fushimi. You don't need to get involved any further. You've done enough.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Oh, um, sure... Thank you...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right, you can go now. Sorry for taking up your time.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Umm... Okay...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - ......   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Looking away - I've... done enough...?   
Looking away - Have I really?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Fushimi?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Looking away - All I've done so far is rely on Arisato-san, and now I'm doing it to you too, Miss President.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Angry - The truth is, I haven't done anything at all!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - ......   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - I told myself it would be different this time...   
Looking away - And if I leave this for someone else to fix, I'm never going to be able to change!   
Sad - So Miss President, please let me handle this! I'll go and speak with Mr. Takenozuka!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - Wait, Fushimi!   
   
---   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - I clearly remember what happened that day!   
Sad - You had a bandage on your chin because you cut yourself while shaving.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Angry - I also remember handing the fee money to you directly! Or are you really going to say that this is my mistake?   
   
Mr. Takenozuka   
Fee... money...?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Angry - Give me an explanation, right now! Or else...   
   
Mr. Takenozuka   
I'm so sorry! You're right, it's completely my fault!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Well, Arisato-san has been— Wait, what?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Everyone is suspecting me of— Wait, what?   
   
Mr. Takenozuka   
Well, the truth is I accidentally took the money home with me...   
I've been meaning to bring it back here, but then I completely forgot.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Surprised - What...? What!?   
   
Mr. Takenozuka   
It's just, the payment deadline was pushed back, so I didn't think it was that urgent...   
Then I kept forgetting to bring it in each day, but I figured I'd get around to it eventually.   
And, well... here we are now...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Looking away - How... How could you!?   
   
Mr. Takenozuka   
I know! This is completely my responsibility!   
I'll make sure to explain everything... I'm sorry for the trouble!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Exasperated* - So there's the truth. I'm almost more dumbfounded than angry...   
Angry - How do you even call yourself a teacher!?   
   
Mr. Takenozuka   
I-I'm so sorry...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - It's okay, Miss President...   
Sad - Everyone makes mistakes.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Well, that concludes my business here.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Let's go, Arisato-san.

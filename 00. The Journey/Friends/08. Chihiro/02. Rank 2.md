Chihiro Fushimi   
Sorry to drag you along while I go shopping...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Don't worry about it.   
I was bored anyway.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - If you say so... But, um... thank you...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
I was so busy searching through the books... I'm sorry if I ignored you, Arisato-san.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - B-But even so! I notice how you're always so willing to help me, Arisato-san!   
Sad - I-It's my fault, isn't it? I didn't mean to make you feel guilty about it...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Um... I'm sorry I took so long...   
This place has so many interesting books, I was having a bit of trouble deciding.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
...Um, do you read much, Arisato-san?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I read the classics.   
I read manga.   
I read fashion magazines.   
I don't read books.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Really!? I, um... didn't think you'd be into that kind of thing...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
The classics aren't very entertaining, but I can respect what the authors were trying to accomplish.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - I love manga too. My bookshelf is full of shojo manga.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
I tend to get frustrated when the main character can't ask out the guy she likes. I think it's because I can relate to her...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
I'm actually not too familiar with that sort of thing... Not that it's uninteresting or anything...   
I'm just clueless when it comes to fashion. I'm nothing like you, Arisato-san...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - I-I'm sorry. I'm not very good at carrying a conversation...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
That makes sense... The Internet makes information so accessible these days.   
So it's kind of a waste of money to buy books, isn't it...?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - ...Oh, I'm sorry! This, um, probably isn't the best place to talk...   
Sad - The shop owners probably wouldn't want us standing here either...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Um, hey... Arisato-san?   
Is it boring for you to hang around with, um... someone like me?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'm having fun.   
Yeah, it's a drag.   
I'm indifferent.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - O-Oh, what a relief. I've been so worried about that this entire time...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to waste your time...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Wh-What? You're spending time with me even though you don't care?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Oh, um... Well...   
Happy - T-Today, I was able to, um, say what was on my mind to you, Arisato-san.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
...I want to stop being so afraid of everything, and I want to be able to talk to other people.   
My homeroom teacher, Mr. Takenozuka... He gives me a lot of class-related tasks.   
But I'm always so scared, that all I can do is nod...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Are you only like this with guys?   
Why are you so afraid?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Well... It's not much of a story, but... my dad is a very scary person.   
Sad - I'm not living with him anymore, but I can still remember the face he made when he got mad.   
Sad - So... whenever I see a man now, all I can think of is that face...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I shouldn't have asked.   
I'm sorry.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Oh, no! I'm really happy that you care. Thank you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Chihiro seems to appreciate my company.   
I feel like our relationship has grown...

Happy - Ah... I should get going. I'll see you at school.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I parted ways with Chihiro, then   
headed back to the dorm.

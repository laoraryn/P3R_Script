Happy - Arisato-san, hurry!   
Happy - I hope no one's bought that illustration collection... Ahh, please still be there...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Come on!   
   
Student's Voice   
Wait!   
   
Disgruntled Student   
Fushimi! They said our class's materials fee hasn't been paid yet.   
   
Aloof Student   
Yeah, I was totally getting grilled in the faculty office just now...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Oh right, the money...   
Sad - I, um... gave it to Mr. Takenozuka... when he came to the office...   
   
Female Student   
You were the one responsible for that money, weren't you, Fushimi-san?   
That means you were the last one who saw it...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Um... But I just told you...   
   
Disgruntled Student   
Well, the teacher told us we haven't paid yet. So doesn't that make this your fault?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Looking away - Umm... Uh... I...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Arisato-san...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Try to remember.   
It's gotta be a misunderstanding.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - But, I'm positive I gave the money to the teacher!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - I know I've made mistakes before, but this time I'm sure...!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Y-Yes, I think so too! I clearly remember giving the money to the teacher!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - It has to be some kind of mistake...   
   
Aloof Student   
...Look, just make sure you take care of it, all right?   
   
Aloof Student   
I'm sure it's exciting to have that much money, but you better do something before everyone finds out.   
Don't worry, we won't tell anyone.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Wait! You think I...?   
Sad - ......   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Looking away - Th-Those guys... They must think I stole the money...   
Looking away - I-I couldn't stand up to them, but I... I didn't take anything!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Don't worry.   
We have to do something...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - B-But how could I not worry? I'm being accused of stealing...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Looking away - ...I'm sorry. I didn't mean to take it out on you, Arisato-san...   
Looking away - I just... I didn't steal anything...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Y-Yes, you're right, Arisato-san. We have to do something...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Looking away - I have to prove to everyone that it wasn't me. But how do I do that...?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - I'm certain I handed the money over. I'll just have to talk to Mr. Takenozuka about this...   
Sad - B-But, what if he thinks I'm accusing him of stealing?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Arisato-san! What should I do...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Chihiro is on the verge of tears.   
I have to do something about this...   
I can sense that Chihiro is relying on me.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Looking away - I... I'm sorry. I know I can't just expect you to solve everything...   
Looking away - This is my problem, so... I need to figure it out on my own.   
Looking away - Bookworms... I think I have to pass today. Sorry...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I walked with Chihiro until   
it was time to part ways.

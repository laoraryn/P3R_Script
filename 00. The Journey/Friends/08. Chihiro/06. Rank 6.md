Chihiro Fushimi   
I spend my breaks doing nothing but reading, so I think it's about time I bought some new ones...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Oh, all of the books on this shelf are only 100 yen each! That means I can afford them with my allowance.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Hmmm...   
We can go now. I don't really see anything that interests me...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
...Hm?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Surprised - W-Wait, is this...!?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Surprised - It is! I've been looking for this collector's edition for forever!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - This is a collection of illustrations from the shojo manga I read! It even has a set of new short stories inside!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - I never thought I'd find this in a used bookstore. And in the novels section too...   
Happy - Maybe the shop owner saw the "short stories" label and made a mistake.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Surprised - ...It's got all three volumes too. This is amazing...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Surprised - Each volume is 6,000 yen, so that means... 18,000 yen total!?   
Sad - Wh-What should I do...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Is it good?   
You're not buying it?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Of course! All three volumes are great!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - The characters are portrayed so realistically! It's like they really exist!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Well, it... It's kind of... expensive.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - I can't afford it with what I have right now, and I don't want to go and take money out of my savings...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
My monthly allowance is 5,000 yen. So it's not enough, even if I save my lunch money...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Angry - But I'll get it, no matter what! I just need to wait until next month... or the month after... or...   
Angry - ...I'll get them by the time I graduate!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
I-I need to hide this where no one will see it...   
Oh, please don't get bought by someone else...

Chihiro Fushimi   
I really wish I had a bigger allowance...   
But I also don't want to make things hard for my mom...   
   
Gaudy Woman   
Hey, I saw that! You were looking at that waitress, weren't you?   
   
Nervous Man   
I-I'm sorry! Forgive me! I'll do anything you want! Anything!   
   
Gaudy Woman   
Then how about you buy me that bag I was talking about before? Or else I'm breaking up with you!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - I used to think that money couldn't buy happiness... or friends...   
Sad - That is, until recently...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What do you think now?   
What do you mean?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - Of course, I still think that's mostly true... but I do have my doubts...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
...Oh, don't worry. I was just talking to myself.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
But... I do sort of understand how he feels...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
That man has no confidence in himself. That's why he's so desperate to stay on the woman's good side.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - I think I can relate to that feeling. He just wants to be with her... no matter the cost.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I can sense affection coming from Chihiro.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
I think lonely people feel really insecure. That's why we seek connections, even if we have to pay for them.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - If only I could be strong and confident in myself, like our student council president...   
Sad - ...I think about that from time to time.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Chihiro has a serious look on her face.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel like I understand   
Chihiro a little better now...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - I can't help but feel like... there are so many things in this world that I'll never have.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Well, should we get going?   
If I stay here, I know I'll just want to go back to the bookstore and look at that illustration collection again.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I walked Chihiro part of the way   
home, then went back to the dorm.

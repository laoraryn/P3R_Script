Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - I'm sorry for dragging you here...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - I thought about talking to my mom, but I don't want to worry her.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - It's just... ever since that money went missing, I've been feeling anxious whenever I'm alone...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
So that's why I'm here?   
I don't mind.   
I'm happy to help.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - S-Sorry... I know it was a selfish request...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Chihiro looks stressed.   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Thank you...   
I feel a bit better now that I got to see you, Arisato-san.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Chihiro seems a little more relaxed.   
I learned a little more about her today.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
I'm sorry. I was trying not to depend on you too much since you've already done so much for me...   
Happy - But hearing you say that does make me feel a lot better.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Chihiro seems happy.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
I'll keep trying to think about what I can do about the missing money...   
But while we're together here, let's talk about happier things.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
We chatted for a while longer before   
I decided to go back to the dorm.

Chihiro Fushimi   
I just know I'm going to cry, so I brought two handkerchiefs with me.   
Happy - Let's go find our seats.   
   
Handkerchief Deliveryman   
A man must always carry a handkerchief... You never know when you might encounter a woman in need.   
   
Heartbroken Woman   
This is so wonderful... If only I'd fallen in love with someone like you...   
   
Handkerchief Deliveryman   
Please, I am but a humble deliveryman. If I can deliver just a bit of kindness to another, that's enough for me.

......   
I learned some romantic   
one-liners from the movie...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Those movies were all so beautiful. I was crying the whole time...   
Happy - Thanks for coming with me. We should probably get going now, though.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
After saying goodbye to Chihiro,   
I decided to go back to the dorm.

Chihiro Fushimi   
Sorry to make you wait so long...   
Once I start reading, I, uh... s-sometimes have a difficult time stopping...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - This was the only place I could think of where we can relax without having to spend much money...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - But, um... now that I think about it, maybe this place wasn't such a good idea...   
Sad - There's not much point in meeting up if we're both just going to read on our own, huh...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You're right, it's pointless.   
I think it's fun, actually.   
We'll do better next time.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Sad - S-Sorry! I-I didn't mean to waste your day off...   
Sad - I-I'll think of something better next ti— Wait! I didn't mean to assume that, um... I-I just... Uh...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Chihiro seems flustered.   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Oh! I-I'm glad! I was worried I was the only one having fun...   
Happy - But I'll come here alone from now on. When I'm with you, I... want to have time to talk.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Chihiro is blushing.   
I learned a little more about her today.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - "Next time"? S-So you mean, um... you'd want to meet like this again...? Oh, I, uh...   
Sad - S-Sorry, I'm being kind of presumptuous, aren't I?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Chihiro seems excited.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Oh, look at the time... Days off always seem to go by so quickly, don't they?   
Um... W-Would it be okay if I walked with you back to your dorm...? Part of the way?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Chihiro and I walked together and   
parted ways as I neared the dorm.

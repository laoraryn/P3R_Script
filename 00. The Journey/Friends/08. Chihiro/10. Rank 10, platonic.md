Chihiro Fushimi   
Thank you for taking the time to help me.   
Did you know that if you want a space to do street fundraising, you have to send the application two months in advance?   
I wonder if this is going to be enough flyers...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Looks tough.   
Were you forced into this?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Yes, it is. But this is what I signed up for.   
The student council president mentioned the street fundraiser before, and now that it's almost here, I asked to be in charge of it.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
No, I asked to take this job. Plus, the student council president will be busy with college entrance exams this year.   
I was looking for some way to help out, and that's how I ended up in charge of this.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Ever since that business with Mr. Takenozuka got resolved, I've felt more confident. Or maybe proactive is the better word.   
I can even talk to the boys in my class now too. Well, a little...   
Anyways, running this fundraiser is just the beginning.   
Happy - From now on, I'm not going to be afraid of trying new things!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Oh, but, um... I'd appreciate it if you could still help me every now and then, just like today.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You can do it.   
I believe in you, Chihiro.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Yes, thank you!   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
...Oh, that reminds me. Do you remember that illustration collection I found at the bookstore?   
Apparently, someone ended up buying it. I checked the other day, and it wasn't there anymore.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
But for some reason, I'm not sad about it.   
As long as whoever bought it is happy, then I'm happy too.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Um, I'd like you to have this...   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
It's a collection of manga short stories by the same artist.   
I bought it a long time ago, and I've read it so many times that I've practically memorized it.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
I'd like this book to be read by all sorts of people too, just like that illustration collection.   
I'm sure that's much better than me just keeping it for myself.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Could I ask that you be the first of those many readers?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Thanks.   
I'll take it.

...When you finish reading it, please pass it on to someone else.   
Maybe it would be a good idea to hand it off at the bookstore.   
It's not in print anymore, so you'll never see it in new releases.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Thank you.   
Happy - I'm so lucky to have met you, Arisato-san. That book couldn't be in better hands.

Ah, there she is! Fushimi-san!   
   
Female Student   
Um... Are we interrupting?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
No, not at all. Did you need something?   
   
Male Student   
Well, the student council led a street fundraiser a while back, and they asked for regular students to participate, right?   
We were curious about maybe learning more. Did you have any information on that?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Of course. I can help with that.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Oh, thank you again for helping me today, Arisato-san.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
I'm sorry I ended up taking so much of your time...   
I'll handle the rest by myself.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I can tag along.   
Are you sure?   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
I can do this on my own. It's just a little bit of talking.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
Happy - Um... If the timing is convenient though, let's walk home together again sometime.   
   
Chihiro Fushimi   
...Okay, go ahead and fill out your name and class on this form.   
Now, as far as what you should expect on the day of...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
After helping Chihiro, I   
headed back to the dorm...

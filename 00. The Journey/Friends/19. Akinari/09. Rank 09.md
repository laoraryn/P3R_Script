Akinari Kamiki   
So... I'd like you to celebrate with me. As of today, I am a free individual.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Free from what?   
You finished your story?   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
From the hospital. They were going to put me under care, but now I don't have to do it.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
No, not quite yet. Almost, though.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
I just came from the hospital. They were going to admit me, but it's no longer needed.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
I guess my body is too weak to undergo surgery. So, I've opted out of examinations and medication.   
I'm done with the hospital.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
...Now, I'm just waiting for the end.   
But, I don't feel like I'm being singled out anymore.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Everyone is waiting to die, all the same... Some just have longer to wait than others.   
But once the time comes, it's the same for all of us.   
I'm still... a little lonely, but I've moved past the sadness.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Happy - Could I get a better look at you...? I want to remember your face.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Kamiki's smile is tinged with sadness...   
I feel like our relationship is stronger now...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Happy - Thank you... I'm... a little bit tired today...   
The story is almost done, so I'll show it to you soon...   
I'll come see you again.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I parted ways with Kamiki,   
then headed back to the dorm.

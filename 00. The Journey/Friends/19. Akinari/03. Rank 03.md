Akinari Kamiki   
Hurt - *cough* *huff* *huff*   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
It's... starting to settle down, I think...   
...Thank you for coming. It's comforting to have someone with me.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Sad - Why do I have to face this alone? Why am I the one...?   
Sad - I can't run around like I did as a child anymore, because my legs and heart won't even let me.   
Sad - ...All that's left is to draw my sheets around me and count the beats of my heart until they stop forever.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Sad - ...Why is this only happening to me?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Maybe it's a whim of God.   
I couldn't say.   
You aren't alone.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Angry - It really is... What a twisted sense of humor he has!   
Angry - There's no reasoning behind it! None at all!   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Sad - ...That's the worst part. If only there was some meaning to my death... But there isn't...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Sad - Hmph... Of course not. No one could. I don't even know.   
Sad - I mean, I understand the reason I'm dying, but what even is the meaning of it?   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
There isn't any meaning to life that I can find, so perhaps I'm not missing all that much.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Angry - Sure, there are plenty of people dying in this world.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Angry - But, so what? What does that have to do with my death?   
Angry - Where is there meaning in any of this!?   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Sad - ...I wish I could run away.   
Sad - But if my body were capable of that, I wouldn't be here anyway...   
No matter what I do, my body is there to remind me... I'm going to die.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Sad - Why... Why me...!?   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Hurt - *cough* *cough*   
Hurt - *gasp* *huff*   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Please don't leave... just yet...   
Sad - It's almost too much for me, if I'm alone...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Don't worry, you're not.   
Try not to talk too much.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Sad - *huff* Right, I suppose I shouldn't...   
Sad - I can accept it...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Sad - *huff* Yes, you're right...   
Sad - But, I'd still like to talk... for just a little longer...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
I'm feeling... a little better now... Thank you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
My presence is comforting to Kamiki...   
I feel like our relationship is stronger...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
...It's starting to get dark.   
Happy - Don't worry, I'll be fine now... I hope I can see you again soon.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I parted ways with Kamiki,   
then headed back to the dorm.

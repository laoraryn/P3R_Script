Akinari Kamiki   
You're... not like the others.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Why am I different?   
Really?   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
I didn't expect to see you again.   
Usually, people don't come back.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
I honestly didn't expect you to come back.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Nobody treats me like a normal person... Not even my friends or family.   
They all keep their distance and say, "Oh, what a poor soul."   
All they feel is pity and curiosity towards me...   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Sorry to disappoint them, but...   
Angry - I'm not the "poor soul" they think I am.   
Dying isn't so bad, is it? What's the point of dragging out your time in this world, anyhow?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You have a point.   
I don't agree.   
I've never thought about that.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
...You must have a hopelessness festering within as well, then. I can't remember a time without it.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
So, aren't you afraid that my hopelessness might be contagious if you hang around me?   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
...They say that necessity is the mother of our industrialized society.   
And yet, fire does not realize that it's burning away. Not exactly foolishness, but sad nonetheless.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
Happy - Thank you for coming today.   
You seem different from the rest.   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
I'm not sure I know how to describe it exactly, but...   
You don't look on me with pity the way everyone else does...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Kamiki seems intrigued by me.   
I feel like our relationship is stronger...

Hurt - *cough* *cough*   
Hurt - Damn it... What did I do to deserve this body?   
Hurt - *wheeze* *gasp*   
   
Akinari Kamiki   
...I hope we can meet again.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I parted ways with Kamiki,   
then headed back to the dorm.

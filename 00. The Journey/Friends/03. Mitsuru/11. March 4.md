What's the matter? You don't look well...   
Are you tired? Try not to overdo it, Minato.   
Surprised - ...!   
Sad - I-I'm sorry. I should try not to call you that in public.   
......   
If you don't mind, could we have a little chat someplace else?   
I have some business to take care of later on...   
Happy - But I'd like to talk with you until then.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure.   
I'm a bit busy today...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - MSG_002_0_0   
Happy - Thank you. In that case... why don't we go to the student council room?   
Happy - I'd like to see it one last time...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - MSG_003_0_0   
Oh, I see...   
Take care, then.

Mitsuru Kirijo   
This room feels so nostalgic, even though the entrance exams have only kept me away for a short while...   
......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The results haven't been posted yet... but I'm fairly confident that I passed.   
If that's the case, then this spring, I'll formally become a college student.   
...And that means I'll no longer be seeing this view.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Unfortunately, I don't have much time to spare today. The company heads are conducting a briefing.   
Sad - The Kirijo Group may appear strong, but it's actually rather frail... It could collapse at any time.   
Sad - I have to keep it together...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Don't push yourself.   
Any way I can help?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Heh... You're right. Resting is of equal importance.   
Still, this is a crucial moment for me. I'll accept that I may need to go a bit overboard.   
But if I do end up needing a change of pace, I hope you'll help me clear my head.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Heh, of course. In fact, there's something that only you can do.   
Happy - Who else is going to help me clear my head when I need a change of pace?   
Happy - It's thanks to you that I learned to feel comfortable in my own skin, beyond my identity as a Kirijo.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Before long, I'll be taking my leave from the dorm as well.   
Sad - I've begun packing up my things, but... I haven't made significant progress.   
Sad - My books, my clothes, my photos... Every one of them brings back memories.   
Happy - It's been a short, but eventful three years. It all went by so fast.   
Happy - Especially the year that you came.   
   
-   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Whenever we spoke, or passed each other in the dorm... I felt like my heart would burst.   
Happy - I never knew I had these emotions just waiting to be given permission to be felt.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I wonder what would have become of me if you hadn't transferred to this school...   
If I hadn't met you...   
Would I have gone through with the arranged marriage?   
Or would I have gotten on my motorcycle and left it all behind?   
Fate is... a mysterious thing.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Well, there's no point in dwelling on the past.   
There are things that need to be done—for the future of the Kirijo Group, as well as my own.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
And... for your future as well, Minato.   
......   
You know what I mean, right?   
Come introduce yourself to the heads of the family sometime. Don't worry, you'd only be saying hello.   
Happy - I'd just like them to know who you are.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Well, it's almost time. I'd best be on my way.   
I'd love to see you back at the dorm, but I'll be out late tonight. Perhaps this weekend?   
Just the two of us.   
Happy - Heh, who else will lend me their shoulder when I need a little support?   
You're the only one who can do this for me.   
Go on, try and name someone who could do the same.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Heh, was that a bit much? Well, now you know how serious I am, Minato.   
Happy - I... need you in my life.   
Happy - ......   
   
-   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - It's hard to believe I've begun to feel like an ordinary high school student...   
Happy - I never knew I had these emotions just waiting to be given permission to be felt.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I wonder what would have become of me if you hadn't transferred to this school...   
If I hadn't met you...   
I might never have realized what was truly important to me.   
Or would I have gotten on my motorcycle and left it all behind?   
Fate is... a mysterious thing.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Well, there's no point in dwelling on the past.   
There are things that need to be done—for the future of the Kirijo Group, as well as my own.   
Even if I lose my way again someday... it doesn't matter.   
I know things will work out.   
I won't have to face it alone. You're the one who taught me that.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right, it's almost time. I must be on my way.   
Happy - Perhaps we could find some time to relax together on a weekend. I found a nice crêpe shop that I'd like to try.   
It's a bit far, though... You'd better get your motorcycle license soon.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Just imagine hitting the road on our motorcycles together... I look forward to it.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - ...Well, we'll see. Now then, if you'll excuse me.

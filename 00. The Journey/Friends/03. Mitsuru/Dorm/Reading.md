Mitsuru Kirijo   
I've already read most of the books here...   
Oh, are you here to look for a book, too? The ones in this section are a little difficult though.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Today seems like a good day to simply rest and spend the night in peace and quiet.   
Perhaps I should read a book tonight, too.   
Happy - I hear reading has been proven to relieve stress. If you've the time, would you care to join me?

Do you have a book to read? If you'd like, I could lend you something from my collection.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yes, please.   
Not now.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Oh, would you like to read a book, too?   
Then shall we read together? You could choose a book from here if you want.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Oh, you're here to read as well? I had assumed you'd be exhausted after the tournament.   
Happy - I see you're quite engaged in both academics and sports. Let's read together again, shall we?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Reading together with Mitsuru might   
help improve my .   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
There are a couple biographies I recommend. What do you think?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's read together.   
Not today.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If you're not too busy, would you care to join me, Arisato?   
Actually, I'd love to hear your opinion on this one book.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I know you must be tired after the tournament, but do you have some time to spare tonight?   
Actually, I'd love to hear your opinion on this one book.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Looks like there's a book   
Mitsuru wants me to read.   
Reading together with Mitsuru might   
help improve my .   
Mitsuru might gain a new ability soon...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Whenever you have time is fine. So, what do you say?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's read together.   
Not now.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I just wanted to take a break from everything, to just sit down and read...   
Would you care to join me?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I can't say if it'll be a good change of pace from your tournament, but...   
If you're in the mood, shall we read together?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It doesn't seem like Mitsuru will gain any   
more skills even if we read together...   
But if I spend time reading with her,   
my  might improve.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If you don't mind, I could lend you another one of my recommendations.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's read together.   
I'll think about it.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - All right, I'll go grab that book for you.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I see. Well, let me know if you ever feel like reading together.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Did you need something?

Mitsuru Kirijo   
Is this about us reading together?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yes, let's.   
Not now.   
   
------   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I passed some time reading with Mitsuru...   
She's turning the pages intently...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
"A wise man harmonizes, but does not conform"... This story resonates no matter how many times I read it.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
By learning about the exploits   
of renowned individuals, my   
 have improved...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Whew, I think we've hit a good stopping place. Let's retire for the night.   
   
-----   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I didn't put a lot of thought into what books I brought... I just took whatever caught my attention.   
Sad - I apologize, Arisato. I should have asked what your preferences were beforehand.   
If you don't mind my asking now... What kinds of books do you usually read?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Novels.   
Manga.   
Textbooks.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Oh, do you now? I'm partial to historical fiction myself. I actually read a lot of it.   
I'm rather fond of novels. All you have to do is turn the page to experience another person's life.   
That reminds me, Yamagishi mentioned liking novels as well.   
I never inquired further, but maybe she'd make for a good reading partner.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hmm... To be honest, I'm not too familiar with the medium, though I admit I've been curious.   
Combining pictures with text sounds like a powerful form of expression.   
Happy - Perhaps I'll borrow some from Iori to broaden my horizons.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Oh, I see. Reading is the core of knowledge, after all.   
Are you interested in the humanities, or sciences? I've even seen books on art and architecture...   
Whatever the case, it's good to see that you have such a wide range of interests.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Incidentally, the books I brought today are things like biographies and history books.   
I can attest that they're all worthwhile reads. Rather accessible ones, too.   
I hope you find them to your liking.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Oh my, you're really tearing through the pages. I'm impressed by your focus.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
By diving into a world unknown,   
my  have improved...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's nice to spend some time reading quietly together like this.   
Happy - Thank you. That made for a relaxing evening.   
Well then, it's about time we return to our rooms. Good night, Arisato.

Mitsuru Kirijo   
Do you ever feel encouraged reading about the influential figures of the past?   
Even leaders who forged great nations faced the challenges of interpersonal relationships...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I feel that.   
Not really.   
Something on your mind?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yes... It becomes easier to bear when you consider it's something everyone has to go through.   
Happy - Or is it presumptuous of me to relate to such illustrious figures?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Heh, does it tarnish your image of such illustrious figures to imagine them on the same level as us?   
Happy - Everyone interprets art in their own way. That's part of what makes it so interesting.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Well, it's natural to consider things, isn't it?   
Happy - Oh, were you expressing concern for me? Thank you, Arisato.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sorry, I didn't mean to distract from our reading.   
Shall we get back to it?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Oh, look at the time. I think that's enough for today.   
Happy - That was a pleasant time together, hearing nothing but the sound of each other's pages.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts

I'd like to hear your thoughts on our reading again sometime. But for now, good night.

I'd like to hear your thoughts on our reading again sometime. But for now, good night.

Mitsuru Kirijo   
I see you're reading a biography of the empress dowager from the Qing dynasty.   
By many accounts, she was vilified as a ruthless despot during her reign.   
Then again, these kinds of stories are known to stretch the truth...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Ah, pardon me. I'm getting ahead of myself.   
I should let you read first.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The book recounts one   
woman's rise to power...   
......   
It seems she led a turbulent life marked   
by cunning and backdoor politics...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
By learning about the exploits   
of renowned individuals, my   
 have improved...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Reading this actually made me think.   
What is the right way for a person to rule?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Too much kindness, and you'll be seen as weak. Sometimes, a ruler needs to be harsh.   
Sad - Even so, I imagine the empress dowager's final years must have been lonely, given that she was feared by her people.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What do you think, Arisato?   
A ruler is responsible for the lives of many others.   
Is it difficult for someone like that to find happiness like everyone else?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Probably.   
You just have to try.   
We all find our own happiness.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Heh... You certainly don't mince words.   
Happy - But I can see the point you're making.   
I could stand to learn a thing or two from you. You're our leader, after all.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Oh, did it sound like I was talking about myself?   
Happy - It wasn't my intent to complain. I know what I'm getting into.   
Happy - I do appreciate your concern, though. Thank you, Arisato.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...I see.   
A happiness equal to the hardship, perhaps...?   
It's hard to imagine what form it will take, but I'd like to believe that's true.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Yes, you're right.   
I'm sure the same was true for my father...   
Happy - I believe he found his own form of happiness.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You know, thanks to you I've been able to sit down and reflect on a reading for the first time in a while.   
Happy - It really does help to have a partner going through the same book as you.   
Happy - Being able to discuss the material allows us to broaden our horizons even further.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Mitsuru seems satisfied with our reading...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Such storied figures are often only written about after their passing, but surely sparks of their greatness could have been seen long before.   
Sometimes, I find myself thinking you have that same potential.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You're exaggerating.   
You've got a good eye.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Heh, am I? I'd like to say I'm a fairly good judge of character.   
Happy - In other words, I have faith in your abilities. I hope you're up to the task.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Heh, and you've got a way with words. I trust you won't disappoint.   
Happy - Jokes aside, I do have a lot of faith in your abilities. I hope you'll wield them with confidence.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Oh, it's gotten late. We'd best turn in for the evening.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Let's have another reading session here in the future. But for now, have a good night.

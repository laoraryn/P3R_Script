Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - ...This smells magnificent.   
I only drink tea back home, so I don't know very much about coffee...   
But this is quite nice.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
This is a nice change of pace, having coffee outdoors with a friend, like so.   
Once I graduate and take over the Kirijo Group, I won't have time to do something like this for a while.   
......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - I think I've said something similar before.   
It seems I have a tendency to spill all my thoughts when I'm with you. I wonder why.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Because I'm the leader.   
Because I'm your friend.   
Don't worry about it.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I suppose you're right. Your leadership skills have helped me more than you realize.   
Come to think of it, you've had the makings of a great leader since the very beginning.   
Sad - As someone who will soon be leading a company, I ought to follow your example.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Mitsuru looks worried.   
I learned a little more about her today.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ......   
Sad - Yes... You may be right.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I suppose I'm still not used to having close friends.   
Sad - I still have a lot to learn...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Mitsuru looks worried.   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...I see.   
Happy - ......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Your thoughtfulness is very reassuring.   
Happy - ...Thank you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Mitsuru looks happy.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - I haven't had such a relaxing time in a while.   
I think I'll have another cup before heading home. What about you?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Mitsuru and I spent some time chatting   
before heading back to the dorm.

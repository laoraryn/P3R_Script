Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - How odd...   
Happy - We aren't doing anything special, yet our time together never bores me.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - E-Er...   
Sad - So, um, Minato— Oh no, I mean, Arisato...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What is it?   
You usually don't call me that.   
Coward.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - ...I-It's nothing! Don't mind me.   
Surprised - I just wanted to call you by your first name...   
But this isn't the right place... I'll try again—next time, in private.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Mitsuru seems uncharacteristically fidgety...   
I learned a little more about her today.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Oh, um...   
Sad - I did want to call you by your first name, but... I'd rather try again—in private.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Mitsuru seems embarrassed.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Wha—!? Oh, now you've done it.   
You dare accuse me, Mitsuru Kirijo, of being a coward?   
Fine then, I'll show you. I'll call you by your first name all you want next time—that is... when we're alone in my room.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Mitsuru seems uncharacteristically fidgety...   
I learned a little more about her today.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Why am I always the one getting flustered?   
Happy - I'd love to figure out what exactly will make you crack...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I've been considering going on a road trip these days, just me and my motorcycle.   
Of course, we have to take care of business before that.   
Once everything is over... where would be a nice place to go?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
A hot spring town.   
The countryside.   
You don't need a destination.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Good idea. Hot spring towns are a popular destination for a trip.   
Happy - Soaking in a hot spring sounds wonderful, especially after a long bike ride in the cold wind.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Mitsuru is smiling.   
I learned a little more about her today.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - In other words, escaping from the hustle and bustle of city life.   
Happy - Cruising past a few farms doesn't sound like a bad idea, actually.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Mitsuru is smiling.   
I learned a little more about her today.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Heh...   
Happy - That does sound interesting, especially coming from you.   
Happy - Just traveling spontaneously without any particular destination in mind, huh...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Mitsuru is smiling.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - What else would you like to do on a trip?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
We chatted for a little while longer   
before heading back to the dorm.

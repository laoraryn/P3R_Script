Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's nice to let loose and sing every once in a while.   
I didn't know you could change the song's key with the karaoke machine either.   
Happy - I thought I wouldn't get to sing much since I can't hit any high notes, but thanks to that, I got to sing my fair share of songs.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Oh, look at the time...   
We ended up spending the entire three hours we paid for.   
Even though each song only lasts a few minutes... Well, as they say, time flies when you're having fun.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Should we... head back now?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I guess we should.   
Let's hang out more.   
You don't want to?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Y-You're right.   
I suppose I ought to set a good example as the student council president and get home before curfew.   
Sad - ......   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Mitsuru seems a little disappointed.   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
A-All right.   
Yes, it should be fine as long as we're home before curfew.   
Happy - Then... shall we walk around a little more?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Mitsuru seems rather happy.   
I learned a little more about her today.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - N-No, that's not what I meant!   
Sad - It's just that...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - How should I say this...?   
Sad - ......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's no big deal...   
Happy - I just thought it might be fun to go somewhere else before we head home.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Mitsuru seems happy.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Shall we go, then? I need to rejuvenate myself for tomorrow while I can.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
We walked around together for a   
while before returning to the dorm.

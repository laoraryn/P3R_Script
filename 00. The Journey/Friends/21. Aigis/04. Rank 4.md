Troubled Old Lady   
Excuse me... Could I trouble you for a moment?   
Have you seen a kitty cat around here?   
   
Troubled Old Lady   
She's a precious little white, spotted cat named Mii-chan. She slipped away when I wasn't looking.   
I'm so worried about where she could have gone...   
   
Troubled Old Lady   
She's getting on in her years like me, so I doubt she could have gotten very far.   
   
Aigis   
A white, spotted cat... Did you see one, Minato-san?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I might have...   
No, I haven't.   
   
Troubled Old Lady   
Goodness, really!? Where might this have been?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Near the station.   
Near the strip mall.   
I don't remember.   
   
Troubled Old Lady   
Thank you, dear! I'll go look for her.   
   
Troubled Old Lady   
Oh, I see...   
I've been so worried... I hope my little Mii-chan is eating all right...   
   
Troubled Old Lady   
Thank you for your help. I'll try looking elsewhere.   
   
Aigis   
A white, spotted cat named Mii-chan...   
If you don't mind, Minato-san... could we help her look?   
Being separated from a loved one can be very distressing after all...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
All right.   
What a pain...   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Yes!   
Um, what's the phrase usually used in situations like these?   
Happy - "What goes around, comes around to hit you in the back of the head"!   
Happy - That's it!   
   
Aigis   
Sad - But if they remain separated, she will feel the same pain that Koromaru-san once did...   
If we help, I think we can at least reduce the chances of that happening!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It seems I can't turn her down.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - She might be so hungry she could eat a house.   
Sad - ......   
   
Aigis   
Or was it, "hungry as a house"?   
   
Aigis   
In any case, we should hurry.

Aigis   
Mii-chan-san!

Aigis   
Mii-chan-san!   
   
Aigis   
Are you there?   
   
---   
   
Aigis   
Sad - There's no trace of her.   
Sad - I can detect hostile readings like Shadows, but when it comes to this...   
   
Aigis   
I'm useless... aren't I?   
And I was the one who insisted we search... I'm sorry.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Don't let it get to you.   
We should head back for today.   
Let's keep looking.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - It's not working out, after all... How could a machine like myself have feelings like a normal person?   
Sad - ......   
   
Aigis   
It's getting dark. We should probably give up the search for today.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Thank you very much, Minato-san.   
Happy - I'm happy that you took the time to indulge me in this.   
   
Aigis   
Yes, you're right. It's getting dark.   
Sad - ......   
   
Aigis   
Sad - It's not working out, after all... How could a machine like myself have feelings like a normal person?   
Thank you very much, Minato-san.   
Happy - I'm happy that you took the time to indulge me in this.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Thank you, Minato-san.   
But it's getting dark. We should probably give up the search for today.   
Happy - I'm happy that you took the time to indulge me in this.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - ......   
Sad - It's not working out, after all... How could a machine like myself have feelings like a normal person?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Aigis is smiling...   
I feel like I understand   
Aigis a little better now...   
   
Aigis   
Sad - I'll be going back alone today... I need some time to think.   
Sad - I'm sorry... And after you invited me out, too...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
We decided to go back   
to the dorm separately.

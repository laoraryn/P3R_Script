Aigis   
Rest easy. You and I will be together all the time now, Minato-san.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
She's still far from passing as a human...   
It doesn't look like she understands   
ordinary feelings and conversation yet.   
If she could, I might be able   
to form a bond with her.   
   
Aigis   
I have inspected the entire school, but I did not locate anyone suffering from Apathy Syndrome.   
Should I conclude that they are absent?

Aigis   
Junpei-san has already left school. He went to the hospital.   
Lately, he seems to be emotionally distressed.

Aigis   
Junpei-san went to the hospital again.   
He seemed quite eager to get there. Has the questioning been going smoothly?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yep.   
Not really.   
He's making... "progress."   
   
Aigis   
We can expect some useful information, then.   
   
Aigis   
That is unfortunate, but not unexpected.   
   
Aigis   
Do I detect an underlying meaning? Is there something between her and Junpei-san that I am not aware of?   
In any case, I have difficulty grasping those kinds of subtleties.

Everyone seems excited about the upcoming festival.   
I have yet to experience such an event, so I cannot relate.

Aigis   
I have heard that Yukari-san is going to be working at a maid café during the festival.   
I am not familiar with the concept. However...   
The male students in particular seem exceptionally excited to see her new outfit.

Aigis   
That was quite a sizable typhoon. I had expected the school would have sustained some damage.   
However, I was mistaken. It must have been durably constructed.

Aigis   
May I ask you something?   
Do you think anyone suspects that I am a robot?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
No way.   
It's possible.   
   
Aigis   
Understood. Then, no adjustments are necessary.   
   
Aigis   
Do I lack human mannerisms?   
From now on, I will attempt to mimic various idiosyncrasies to avoid detection.   
   
Aigis   
The moon will soon be full again. Have you made adequate preparations for the battle?   
If you feel unprepared, you should go to the mall immediately after school.   
   
Aigis   
It is unfortunate, but not many students appear to be saddened by Aragaki-san's death.   
Apparently, human relationships are quickly forgotten, though our case is exceptional.   
   
Aigis   
It is rational for students to concentrate on their exams, rather than Aragaki-san.   
However, for some unknown reason...   
I question the value of thinking like that.   
   
Aigis   
Fuuka-san said she "figured it out."   
What do you think, Minato-san?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I understand her.   
I don't get it.   
   
Aigis   
That's good to hear.   
   
Aigis   
Neither do I.   
   
Aigis   
......   
I'm sorry, I was just thinking.   
I was considering what I might stand to gain from attending school.   
But, I suppose nothing will come of this line of thought. It's not something I should entertain.   
   
Aigis   
Junpei-san seems to sleep a great deal.   
He must be conserving energy to remain prepared for combat.   
It is quite an interesting tactic.   
   
Aigis   
......   
I'm sorry, I was just thinking.   
I was wondering what will become of me once we have defeated all the Shadows.   
I hope I can continue to attend school.   
   
Aigis   
Tomorrow is the final battle. Are you ready?   
If you need supplies or equipment, make sure to get everything today.   
   
Aigis   
For some reason, I was unable to concentrate on the lesson today.   
Sad - This is very unlike me. I have never lost focus on an assignment before...   
   
Aigis   
Ryoji-san is dangerous.   
Angry - I have re-analyzed him, and still detect nothing out of the ordinary. Nonetheless, I have a "bad feeling" about him.   
   
Aigis   
The fact that this school conducts its field trips every other year is unusual, is it not?   
So there was no trip last year, which means the current third-years haven't gone on their school trip yet...   
First-year students don't go on a trip, so this year, the second- and third-years are going together.   
   
Aigis   
Most of the people I meet appear nervous about the upcoming trip.   
Are you nervous, Minato-san?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Naturally.   
Not really.   
How about you, Aigis?   
   
Aigis   
Happy - That's good. You're just like everyone else, then.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - You seem calm. Perhaps you should be a little more nervous...   
   
Aigis   
Sad - I don't know. Do I seem like I am?   
   
Aigis   
Deciding on one's career seems to be a fascinating process.   
However, since I am designed primarily for combat, it wouldn't be very useful for me.   
   
Aigis   
Junpei-san went home early today.   
He was clearly in low spirits. It seems he hasn't fully recovered from the incident...   
Sad - I'm worried about him...   
   
Aigis   
I'm worried about Ryoji-san, and it's even affecting my concentration...   
This is a grave situation. What should I do...?   
Sad - ......   
   
Aigis   
Ryoji-san didn't come to school today... I wonder what happened.   
Sad - ......   
   
Junpei Iori   
UNUSED   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Unused   
   
Aigis   
I drew a paper fortune, and it said, "Great Luck."   
Happy - I'm sure that means everything will work out for the best.   
   
Aigis   
It's been a while since I last came to school.   
I know this isn't exactly the best situation, but... I have a new outlook on so many things.   
...Um, Minato-san, do you have any plans after school today?   
If you don't mind... I would like to walk home with you.   
   
Aigis   
Oh, Minato-san...   
Happy - Do you have any plans after school?   
Happy - If you don't mind... I would like to walk home with you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Walk home with her   
Don't go with her   
   
Aigis   
Thank you...   
Oh, but there is one place I would like to visit before returning to the dorm...   
Happy - ...Shall we go?   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Oh... That's too bad.   
Well... I'll see you back at the dorm, then.   
   
Aigis   
Um, Minato-san...   
...I want to be by your side.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Aigis is gazing directly into my eyes...   
   
Aigis   
Oh, Minato-san...   
......   
Do you have time to talk today?   
Sad - Although, I'm not sure if I can communicate this properly...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend some time   
after school with Aigis?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Spend time with her   
Check Social Link status   
Not now   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Thank you very much. Shall we go, then?   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Thank you very much.   
...U-Um...   
I would like to... show you my room.   
Happy - I would like you to see how I live, and... Um...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
......   
I decided to go to Aigis's room.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - ...I see. I understand.   
Sad - Well then... please take care.   
   
Aigis   
Um, Minato-san...   
I'm going to do my best...   
......   
Happy - I want to be with you. I want to live by your side.   
Happy - So, please...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel an unbreakable bond   
with Aigis...   
   
Aigis   
Ah, Minato-san. Are you heading home?   
Sad - I have a favor to ask. It's something I can't do alone...   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Oh, thank you so much!   
Happy - Let's return to the dorm, then. I can hardly wait.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Oh, I see.   
Um, maybe next time...   
   
Aigis   
Ah, Minato-san.   
I'm going to do my best.   
Happy - I want to stay by your side and make all kinds of memories together.   
Happy - So, don't worry...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel an unbreakable bond   
with Aigis...   
   
Aigis   
Hello, Minato-san. The weather is lovely today.   
...If you don't mind, I'd like to walk home with you again.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Thank you so much.   
Um... Before we leave, could we take a slight detour? I want to go to the roof.   
   
Aigis   
Oh, Minato-san...   
Happy - Are you leaving already? Then I'll come with you...   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Thank you so much.   
It's cold out, so we should head straight home. Let's see, when is the next train...?   
   
Aigis   
Minato-san... Are you going home for today?   
Sad - If you don't mind, I'd like to stop by somewhere with you on the way back...   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Oh, thank you so much.   
Does Paulownia Mall work? I know everyone always hangs out there.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - I've been continuing my search for Mii-chan-san, but I haven't had any luck yet...   
Sad - Anyways, Minato-san...   
Sad - I would like to walk home with you again. Is that okay?   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Thank you so much.   
Today is another cold day. Let's hurry before it gets dark.   
   
Aigis   
Oh, Minato-san.   
I would like to walk home with you again today. Would you mind?   
   
Aigis   
Thank you so much!   
Happy - Could we go to the strip mall? I really enjoy how lively it is there...   
   
Aigis   
...Minato-san.   
Sad - ......   
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you mind if I accompany you again today?   
   
Aigis   
Happy - ...Thank you so much.   
Could we go for a walk today? I'd like to observe people somewhere busy.   
   
Aigis   
Oh, Minato-san. Today feels a little warmer than usual.   
Sad - Are you leaving? If you don't mind, could we go to the roof...?   
   
Aigis   
...Thank you.   
Shall we go, then?   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Minato-san...   
Sad - I need to speak with you right now, if possible...   
   
Aigis   
Happy - ...Thank you.   
Happy - Do you mind if we go to the roof? I think the view will be nice today.   
   
Aigis   
Minato-san...   
Sad - I have a favor to ask... Could you hear me out?   
   
Aigis   
...Thank you.   
Do you mind if we go to the roof? I think the view will be nice today.

I will see you at the dorm, then. Please take care.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - ...I see. I understand.   
Sad - Um...   
Looking away - ...Never mind, it's nothing. Please take care.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - ...I see. I understand.   
Looking away - ......   
   
Aigis   
Sad - ...I see. I understand.   
I'm sorry for imposing. I'll see you back at the dorm.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Oh... I-I see.   
Sorry for being so sudden. Please take care.   
   
Aigis   
...I see. I understand.   
Happy - I hope there will be another opportunity in the future, then.   
   
Aigis   
...I see. I understand.   
I'm sure you must be busy. Please take care.   
   
Aigis   
I see.   
Happy - I hope we'll have another chance in the future, then.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - You can always rely on me. No matter what happens, I will help you in any way that I can.   
   
Aigis   
On today's itinerary, we will be visiting the local shrines and temples. I am looking forward to it.   
Fuuka-san's class has already gone ahead of us.   
   
Aigis   
This is the first time I have seen a bathtub this large.   
Although... it seems highly inefficient to leave the hot water running.   
   
Aigis   
Just now, I saw Yukari-san and Mitsuru-san leave the vicinity together.

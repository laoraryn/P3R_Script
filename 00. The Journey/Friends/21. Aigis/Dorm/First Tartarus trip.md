As of today, I will be joining in the operations to explore Tartarus. I am ready for deployment.

I have also been equipped with a number of combat functions, in addition to the ability to summon a Persona.   
I will provide more details later, but suffice to say, you won't want to miss it.

Looking forward to it.   
Don't get carried away.   
Can you transform?

When the time comes, prepare to have your mind blown! ...As they say.   
   
Aigis   
Is that our tactical approach? Understood, proceeding to "not get carried away."   
   
Aigis   
Currently, I am not outfitted with any functions that enable me to morph or transform.   
I apologize for being unable to meet your expectations.   
However, I am prepared to undergo modifications if the situation demands it.   
   
Aigis   
Our current objective is the elimination of the large Shadows that appear during a full moon.   
In order to accomplish this, it will be crucial to gather combat data in Tartarus.   
Please make efficient use of my facilities so that we may achieve our goal.

   
Aigis   
Minato-san, I'm glad you're here.   
Are you available tonight? I have borrowed a book about yakuza from the library.   
I was searching for combat-related material, and the librarian suggested this.   
It seems to provide information on combat tactics as well as the proper mindset for battle.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Reading yakuza novels with Aigis could   
help improve my ...   
   
Aigis   
However, there are some elements that I don't fully comprehend...   
But you may be able to help me understand them more. Would you be willing to try?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure.   
I can't today.   
   
Aigis   
In regard to the yakuza novel that we had previously discussed...   
I was able to acquire the entire series to which it belongs from the library.   
According to my data, this meets the prerequisite conditions for the activity known as a "binge."   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Reading yakuza novels with Aigis could   
help improve my ...   
   
Aigis   
If you have sufficient leisure time available, would you like to participate in this activity with me?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure.   
Not now.   
   
Aigis   
Do you remember the yakuza novel we talked about before?   
Well, I was able to find the entire series in the library and decided to borrow them all.   
If I understand correctly, if I read all the books back to back, I would be "binging."   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Reading yakuza novels with Aigis could   
help improve my ...   
   
Aigis   
If you have the time, would you like to "binge" with me?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure.   
Not now.   
   
Aigis   
Minato-san, are you currently free from predetermined obligations at this moment?   
I would like to enlist your assistance in absorbing all necessary information from the yakuza novels.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Aigis looks serious about this...   
Reading yakuza novels with her could   
help improve my ...   
Aigis might gain a new ability soon...   
   
Aigis   
There is another matter I wish to discuss with you as well.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's read together.   
Maybe later.   
   
Aigis   
Minato-san, do you have a moment?   
If possible, I would like to continue reading those novels together with you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Aigis looks serious about this...   
Reading yakuza novels with her could   
help improve my ...   
Aigis might gain a new ability soon...   
   
Aigis   
Actually... there's something else I would like to talk with you about as well.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's read together.   
Maybe later.   
   
Aigis   
A classmate has recently lent me a number of various yakuza novels.   
She appeared pleased to have met "a fellow yakuza aficionado."   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It doesn't seem like Aigis will gain any   
more skills even if we read together...   
But reading yakuza novels with her   
could help improve my .   
   
Aigis   
Would you like to read together once again?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure.   
Not now.   
   
Aigis   
A classmate has lent me some yakuza novels that I haven't read yet.   
Happy - She seemed very happy when we talked and called me "a fellow yakuza aficionado."   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It doesn't seem like Aigis will gain any   
more skills even if we read together...   
But reading yakuza novels with her   
could help improve my .   
   
Aigis   
If you're free, would you like to read some of them together?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure.   
Not now.   
   
Aigis   
You have my gratitude.   
Since the two of us will be reading from one book, please open it wide so that we may both view its contents.   
   
Aigis   
I understand. Very well.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Thank you!   
Happy - But, um, we'll be reading from the same book, so... please open it wide so that we can both read.   
   
Aigis   
I understand... Sorry for bringing this up so abruptly.   
   
Aigis   
If your schedule permits, I have a favor to ask of you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Reading yakuza novels with Aigis could   
help improve my ...   
   
Aigis   
I would like you to help me improve my reading comprehension abilities.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure, let's do it.   
Maybe another time.   
   
Aigis   
Um, if you have the time... there's something that I'd like your help understanding.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Reading yakuza novels with Aigis could   
help improve my ...   
   
Aigis   
I'm afraid there are some concepts that I have difficulty comprehending on my own...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure, let's do it.   
Maybe another time.   
   
Aigis   
Then I shall retrieve the book from my room. Please stand by until I return.   
   
Aigis   
Understood.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Thank you very much! I will go get the book, then.   
   
Aigis   
Okay, I understand...   
   
Aigis   
Would you like to read together, Minato-san?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It doesn't seem like Aigis will gain any   
more skills even if we read together...   
But reading yakuza novels with her   
could help improve my .   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Reading yakuza novels with Aigis could   
help improve my ...   
   
Aigis   
I would like to read together with you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's read together.   
Not now.   
   
------   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Aigis looks serious...   
I spent time reading with Aigis...   
   
Aigis   
I knew it. Conducting raids against our enemies is a highly efficient tactical strategy.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel like my  has   
increased after reading about the   
main character's righteous spirit...   
   
Aigis   
It's almost bedtime. We should return to our rooms.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Aigis looks serious...   
I spent time reading with Aigis...   
   
Aigis   
It's amazing how combat-effective these raids are.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel like my  has   
increased after reading about the   
main character's righteous spirit...   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Ah, it's almost time to go to sleep. We should head back to our rooms.   
   
---   
   
Aigis   
...Ah, here it is.   
In this scene, the main character says, "That ass better not crack under pressure."   
   
Aigis   
Usually, people's asses are already cracked. Yours is as well, right, Minato-san?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Obviously.   
That's a secret.   
Who knows...?   
   
Aigis   
Good, that is a relief.   
If that is the case, then this must be referring to a different "ass"...   
   
Aigis   
...I understand, but please tell me someday.   
For now, I will put the question on hold.   
   
Aigis   
I can always verify this by searching my database...   
However, I suspect it will currently be faster to investigate manually.   
   
Aigis   
Currently, this is the only section that I am unclear on.   
But I suspect that if I continue reading, I will encounter even more confusing phrases.   
   
Aigis   
If you don't mind, could I ask you to read with me until the end?   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Thank you very much, Minato-san.   
Happy - With your help, I've been able to update my records with new information.   
   
Aigis   
Apparently, this book has a sequel.   
   
Aigis   
If it is possible, I would like to read with you again sometime.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel like my  has   
increased after reading about the   
main character's righteous spirit...   
   
Aigis   
It's gotten rather late.   
We should head back to our rooms... Or should I say, our turfs.   
   
Aigis   
...Ah, here it is!   
In this scene, the main character says, "That ass better not crack under pressure."   
   
Aigis   
But, humans already have cracked asses... Isn't that how they're born?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, that's true.   
Depends on the person.   
No idea.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Oh, good. That's what I thought...   
Happy - If that is the case, then this must be referring to a different "ass"...   
   
Aigis   
Y-You think so?   
I was certain the "ass crack" was a universal feature... I need to study more on human anatomy.   
   
Aigis   
...Maybe it depends on the individual person?   
I'm curious, but at the same time, I feel like I shouldn't delve too deeply...   
   
Aigis   
So far, this is the only section that I'm unclear on.   
But I think if I keep reading, I'm going to find other points that are confusing.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - If you don't mind... could I ask you to keep reading with me until the end?   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Thank you very much, Minato-san.   
Happy - I have a much better understanding now, as a result of your help.   
   
Aigis   
Oh... It looks like this book has a sequel.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - If you don't mind, could we read together again sometime?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel like my  has   
increased after reading about the   
main character's righteous spirit...   
   
Aigis   
Happy - It's already gotten late. We should both head back to our turf...   
Happy - Excuse me. I meant we should go back to our rooms. Good night.   
   
Aigis   
That reminds me. I was reading this book during class once.   
One of our classmates saw and said to me, "Wow, I'm surprised. So, you're the type to talk with your fists."   
   
Aigis   
What exactly do I look like to everyone else?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
A normal high school student.   
Don't worry about that too much.   
A cute girl.   
   
Aigis   
...I see.   
That must mean that I don't appear to be strong in other people's eyes.   
   
Aigis   
No, it's important that I consider this.   
He was surprised. That can only mean one thing...   
   
Aigis   
"Cute"...?   
From what I understand, that term is used to describe small animals.   
Are you saying that I'm also being placed into that category?   
   
Aigis   
I am an anti-Shadow weapon, but I don't seem to be regarded as such...   
I must correct this problem at once.   
If it is not addressed, it could negatively impact my ability to carry out my duties.   
   
Aigis   
Once I finish reading, I will start thinking of a solution.   
   
Aigis   
During combat, the mental states of both sides play a significant role in the outcome.   
I want my presence to strike fear in the hearts of my enemies, but galvanize my allies, as well.   
   
Aigis   
What can I do to convey that kind of impression?   
Ideally, it would be something to encourage people to depend on me...   
   
Aigis   
Maybe I can find some tips in this book...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel like my  has   
increased after reading about the   
main character's righteous spirit...   
   
Aigis   
I think this is enough reading for now. We should return to our rooms.   
   
Aigis   
That reminds me. I was reading this book during class once.   
And one of our classmates said to me, "Wow, I'm surprised. So you're the type to talk with your fists."

That must mean that I don't look strong in other people's eyes.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - ...Thank you. I know you're just being considerate.   
Sad - But still, I can't help but feel bothered by it...   
   
Aigis   
"Cute"...   
I know this is supposed to be a compliment.   
Sad - But if that's how they see me, it can only mean one thing...   
   
Aigis   
Sad - I'm an anti-Shadow weapon, but most people don't see me as one...   
Isn't this a critical issue?   
   
Aigis   
...Once I finish reading, I'll need to think of a solution.   
   
Aigis   
During combat, the mental states of both sides play a significant role in the outcome.   
I want to be able to intimidate my enemies, but also encourage my teammates.   
   
Aigis   
What can I do to give everyone that kind of impression?   
Ideally, it would be something that makes me appear reliable in battle...   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Maybe I can find some tips in this book...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel like my  has   
increased after reading about the   
main character's righteous spirit...   
   
Aigis   
Happy - I think that's enough for today. Good night.

......   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel like my  has   
increased after reading about the   
main character's righteous spirit...   
   
Aigis   
...Um, Minato-san.   
I am going to upgrade my outer appearance.   
   
Aigis   
First, I will triple the current surface area of my armor plating.   
After that, I will repaint my body gold, and add a large dragon to my back...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What are you talking about?   
Not bad, I guess...?   
That sounds tacky.   
   
Aigis   
After reading this book, I came to a conclusion.   
This is what I have to do to appear strong and encourage people to depend on me.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Don't you think? I'm pleased to hear that you agree.   
Are you thinking of getting upgraded yourself, Minato-san?   
   
Aigis   
Angry - That is not true.   
Angry - Once you actually see my upgraded form, I suspect "your socks will explode," as they say.   
   
Aigis   
Outer appearances carry an influence that is beyond my ability to calculate.   
The main character of this story also carefully cultivated his image so everyone would take him seriously.   
   
Aigis   
That is why I'm looking into upgrading myself.   
In order for me to become more dependable, it's necessary I change my appearance.   
Don't you agree, Minato-san?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Looks aren't everything.   
What's important is attitude.   
   
Aigis   
Are you saying there's something else which takes greater priority?   
   
Aigis   
Oh, could it be...?   
I apologize. Please forget what I said about upgrading my appearance.   
   
Aigis   
Attitude...? So that's what takes priority?   
   
Aigis   
Oh, could it be...?   
I apologize. Please forget what I said about upgrading my appearance.   
   
Aigis   
It seems I had the completely wrong idea.   
At one point, the main character of the book says, "Can't have people think I ain't cool..."   
Until then, he'd put so much effort into his attire, yet he goes to raid his rivals' territory wearing nothing but a shimekomi.   
   
Aigis   
Thanks to you, Minato-san, I finally understand.   
What's most important in life is having a strong heart to stay true to your beliefs.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Therefore, I will also follow what I believe in.   
Happy - I may not appear dependable, but don't worry.   
I will adjust my attitude to reach maximum energy output, and to increase my ammo stocks by 50%...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
By understanding the essence of the story,   
Aigis is fueling her fighting spirit...   
   
Aigis   
For some reason, I feel like going to Tartarus and raising some hell.   
Shall we conduct a raid?   
   
Aigis   
Oh, it's gotten so late. It doesn't seem like we'll be able to go tonight.   
   
Aigis   
How unfortunate. I'll just return to my room, then.   
   
Aigis   
......   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel like my  has   
increased after reading about the   
main character's righteous spirit...   
   
Aigis   
...Minato-san.   
I want to give myself a makeover. I need a new image.   
   
Aigis   
Maybe I should triple my current height, so I can look down on my enemies...   
Or maybe I can add spikes to my shoulders, or carve a giant dragon onto my back...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What are you talking about?   
Not bad, I guess...?   
That sounds tacky.   
   
Aigis   
Reading this book has convinced me.   
This is what I need to do if I want people to think I'm strong and reliable.   
   
Aigis   
Is there a problem?   
Happy - Are you considering changing your image as well, Minato-san?   
   
Aigis   
Angry - Th-That's not true!   
Angry - Once you actually see the new me, I'm certain your socks will explode.   
   
Aigis   
Outer appearances carry an unimaginable amount of influence.   
The main character of this story also put a lot of effort into looks so people would take him seriously.   
   
Aigis   
That's why I wanted to change my image, too.   
If I want people to think I'm strong, I need to look the part.   
What do you think, Minato-san? I'd like to hear your opinion, as our leader.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Looks aren't everything.   
What's important is attitude.   
   
Aigis   
What...? You mean there's something else that's more important...?   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Oh, could it be...?   
   
Aigis   
Attitude...? So it's not about appearances, then?   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Oh, could it be...?   
   
Aigis   
Sad - I'm sorry. It looks like I've had the wrong idea.   
At one point, the main character of the book says, "Can't have people think I ain't cool..."   
Up until then, he'd cared so much about his image, yet he goes to raid his rivals' territory wearing nothing but a shimekomi.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - I finally understood what he really meant after hearing what you said, Minato-san.   
Happy - The most important thing... is to hold true to your beliefs, no matter what.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - I'm going to hold true to my beliefs as well.   
Happy - I may not look reliable, but I will make up for that with attitude.   
Happy - I'm going to operate at maximum output so that I can be useful to everyone!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
By understanding the essence of the story,   
Aigis is fueling her fighting spirit...   
   
Aigis   
Happy - For some reason, I feel like going to Tartarus and raising some hell.   
Happy - Maybe we can organize a raid...   
   
Aigis   
Oh, I didn't realize it was so late.   
   
Aigis   
That's unfortunate. I suppose I'll just go back to my room for tonight...

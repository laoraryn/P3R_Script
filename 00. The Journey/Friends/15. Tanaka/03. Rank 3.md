President Tanaka   
Happy - Today, I'll tell you a funny story...   
These days, even a grade-schooler knows how to buy stocks online. How about you? Interested in stock trading?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Maybe a little.   
Not at all.   
   
President Tanaka   
Happy - That's the spirit! If you keep all your money in the bank, your modest gains will be offset by outrageous fees!   
Happy - Don't let the fear of bankruptcy dissuade you! It pays to be aggressive in the management of your assets!   
   
President Tanaka   
Oh my, really? But the stock market is all the rage these days...   
Happy - Quite a cynical worldview, I have to say. But you're sticking to your guns—I like that.   
   
President Tanaka   
Happy - My company just went public on the stock exchange.   
Happy - Since our sales were skyrocketing, we decided to sell shares. And guess what—the number of shareholders skyrocketed too!   
   
President Tanaka   
Happy - Now listen, this is the funny part... The majority of our shareholders are also our customers!   
Happy - They keep buying more of our products, so of course the stock will rise!   
   
President Tanaka   
Isn't that hysterical? You should learn to appreciate the irony.   
I'm thinking of offering you a job, so you should come up with some stories of your own.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I received passionate advice   
from President Tanaka...   
I understand him a little better now...   
   
President Tanaka   
Have you been keeping your promise? You didn't tell anyone, did you?   
Angry - If you go back on your word, I'll find out where you live and ring the doorbell every night!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It's getting late, so I'll go back to the dorm.

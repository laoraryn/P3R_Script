Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This must be the man Maya was   
talking about, the one she saw on TV...   
But he doesn't seem to be interested in me.   
If I had enough  to be ,   
then maybe I could get his attention...   
   
Man in a Suit   
Angry - Of course, you imbecile! I just need to find him!   
   
Man in a Suit   
Happy - My, aren't you handsome.   
Can I interest you in being a part of a promotional campaign I'm running...? Oh, you're still in high school?   
Hmm... That would mean... Perhaps, if I trained him...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The man seems to be

I have some unfortunate news regarding your investment.   
Things are not running as smoothly as planned. It still has the potential to turn a profit, but...   
Happy - I would require an additional 10,000 yen to get things back on track...   
Happy - Are you willing to increase your investment by that much?

Oh, there you are...   
Sad - We ran into a bit of a snag again. Some of the other investors decided to drop out...   
But since there are few investors, everyone will make even more of a profit! So, would you mind investing some more?

Hm? My autograph? Well, normally I'd charge an arm and a leg for this sort of thing...   
Happy - But—just this once—I'll make an exception and give you one for free. In return, you better spread the word about my generosity!   
   
President Tanaka   
Happy - Here you go. Stick it in a frame, and it'll make one valuable family heirloom.

Then, for today... I have a story that's fresh off the press.   
   
President Tanaka   
Happy - You sure come by a lot, Arisato. I must be doing something right, then.   
But I suppose that means the value of a life lesson depends on the learner...   
Well, this one will be free of charge.

President Tanaka   
Happy - Just the other day, my high school organized a class reunion.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sounds fun.   
Sounds like a hassle.   
   
President Tanaka   
Happy - I had a splendid time! I laugh just thinking about it.   
   
President Tanaka   
Sad - Indeed it was. I had to pay for transportation and of course my hotel room.   
   
President Tanaka   
I doubt you'd understand how I feel, since you're still in high school, but...   
Happy - A class reunion is a very important event. It's the perfect opportunity to show everyone how pathetic their lives turned out.   
   
President Tanaka   
Happy - Like that cad who made fun of me for eating plain rice... Or the ingrate who threw my holey socks in the trash.   
Happy - Now, they both look at me with envy. What they make in a year, I make in a month!   
   
President Tanaka   
Happy - My business is doing great, and I'd say I have a satisfying private life as well.   
   
President Tanaka   
Happy - Let me take you under my wing, as our exclusive model. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!   
Happy - Don't think I would extend this offer to just anyone.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
President Tanaka is opening up to me.   
I understand him a little better now...   
   
President Tanaka   
Happy - Oh, remember that 40,000 yen you gave me? I'd say you've gotten your money's worth at this point.   
Happy - My time is worth at least 100,000 yen per hour, you know!   
Happy - Just think of all the free advice I've given you! You can thank me later.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It's getting late, so I'll go back to the dorm.

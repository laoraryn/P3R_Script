Keisuke Hiraga   
I've always thought of "artists" as people on TV or in magazines...   
I never thought that I might become one myself...   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
...Hey. So this is just hypothetical, but... if I become an artist...   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
What would I list as my occupation on a survey...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Artist.   
Entertainment industry.   
Unemployed.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sad - I guess so, but... I think I'd be a little embarrassed to call myself that...   
Well, I guess I can't help it since I'd be one, right? But would people think I'm being arrogant...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hiraga seems to be deep in thought.   
I learned a little more about him today.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - Oh, yeah, that's a good way to put it. Good idea, Arisato-kun!   
Happy - So then I'd be famous, and on TV, and... Whew! I'm getting nervous just thinking about it!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hiraga seems like he's having fun.   
I feel like we became a lot closer today.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sad - So after going through the exchange program and everything... I'll just be "unemployed"?   
Sad - I know the titles you have to your name aren't everything, but... it does make me think...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hiraga seems down.   
I feel like we didn't get any closer today...   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
...Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. I should be taking action, not just mulling it over like this.   
Hey, do you have more time after this? I want to go buy some art supplies.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
After doing some shopping with Hiraga,   
I decided to return to the dorm.

Sorry to make you wait. Shall we?

All right, the coffee's brewed. And the beans are Kilimanjaro, of course.

Mmm, that aroma is unbelievable. To think we trekked almost six kilometers for this one cup of coffee.   
   
Barista   
It truly is a magnificent sight, my friend. This view, being here with you... I'll cherish this memory for as long as I live.

So much beautiful scenery in the movie...   
I feel like I've sharpened my aesthetic sense.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - Wow, that was a spectacle for the ages! I'm so glad we came!   
Well, we should probably head back.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I parted ways with Hiraga   
and went back to the dorm.

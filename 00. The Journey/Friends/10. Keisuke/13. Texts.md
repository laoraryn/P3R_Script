It's Hiraga.   
   
   
Hi. I'm not sure if you remember me, but it's Hiraga from the art club.   
You're not obligated to attend, obviously, but... *sweatdrop* It would be really nice if you showed up.   
I'll be in the art room if you decide to stop by. :)

It's Hiraga.   
   
   
Hey, are you gonna be at the club meeting? No pressure, of course, but if you're interested, I'd really like to paint together again. :)   
I'll have supplies ready for you if you come by.

Art Club.   
   
   
You keep showing up, so that must mean we're doing something right, huh? :)   
There should be a lot of members today, so it would be nice if you were there too. *thumbs up*   
I'll wait for you at the club room.

About quitting the club.   
   
   
I feel like you deserve an explanation.   
I'll tell you all about it today, even if I have to do it in the middle of the club meeting. *thumbs up*   
Hope to see you there.

Sorry about before.   
   
   
I must have made everyone worry when I left all of a sudden. *sweatdrop*   
Now that the dust has settled a little, I can focus on making art.   
You should come by. It would be nice to paint together. :)   
   
-----   
   
I've been thinking.   
   
   
I thought I had this all figured out... *sweatdrop*   
Do you worry about the future?   
Maybe I'm too in my head about this... Hopefully painting will ease the existential dread lol.   
   
-----   
   
Brain's too loud.   
   
   
Still thinking about it... I've actually lost sleep over this. *sweatdrop*   
But I'm scheduled for cleaning duty today, so I'll be at the art club. *thumbs up*   
Will I see you there?   
   
-----   
   
I've made a decision.   
   
   
Please, if you can make it today, come to the art club. I really want to see you.   
Sorry. I don't mean to be selfish, it's just that I'd rather tell you in person.

Arisato-kun.   
   
   
I've asked everyone in the club to come today.   
I'd love it if you came too. Actually, I've decided that you have to. Doctor's orders. :)

Hi! You coming to the art club today?   
Hope to see you there. :)

Burnt out...?   
   
   
What better way to remedy that than a relaxing painting session?   
...   
Ok, sorry, I'll quit with the advertiser voice lol. Swing by if you'd like. *thumbs up*

Art club meets today!    
   
   
I've been trying out some new painting techniques lately. :)   
I'd be happy to teach you some of what I've learned.   
Of course, we can talk about things besides art, too.

Down time...   
   
   
G'morning!    
Been feeling the burnout starting to creep up on me, so I'm gonna take some time for myself and go out.   
I know you're probably busy, but I'd love it if you joined me. Just let me know what you decide before this afternoon.   
Thanks!  :)   
   
-----   
   
Movie, maybe?   
   
   
Sorry for reaching out on such short notice!   
There's a movie out right now that's been getting some critical acclaim regarding its artistic direction. I'm sure it'd help with your charisma, too.    
I might've bought an extra ticket, and I was wondering if you'd like to come along. Let me know! :)

Internal MES - MND_000_0_0   
The scratching of pencils echoes   
throughout the art room...   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sad - Hey, Arisato-kun... Sorry, but I need your advice again.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Let's meet up after art club like we did the other day.   
   
---   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Um, don't tell anyone else about this, okay?   
I'm still torn on studying abroad.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
My dad's trying to make all my decisions for me.   
He chose the school I'd go to, the dorm I'd live in... He even bought my plane ticket already!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sad - And I haven't actually agreed to go through with it yet, either.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sad - He's been like this ever since we argued about the art club.   
It's like he's suddenly trying to be more understanding. It's weird.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Do you want to be a doctor?   
Don't you like art club?   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Well, being a doctor is something I think about a lot.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
If I do end up studying abroad now and become an artist, there's no turning back, is there?   
Then I could never be a doctor.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Looking away - It's not that I don't like it. It's just...   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sad - It's the uncertainty of it all. Painting doesn't feel as fun anymore.   
Sad - Not to mention I might never be a doctor.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
My teachers, my friends, and especially you—everyone's been so supportive.   
And I know what you must be thinking. "A chance to study abroad? What an opportunity!"   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sorry, Arisato-kun. It seems like all I ever do is complain to you.   
Happy - But I always feel a lot better after talking to you, so thanks.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It seems like Hiraga trusts me.   
I feel like we're becoming better friends.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Now I don't even know what I really want to do.   
Happy - In times like this, I turn to the heavens.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - I have to head to the bookstore. You can go on without me.   
Happy - I'm buying a fortune telling book and reading the whole thing in one night!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I parted ways with Hiraga   
and went back to the dorm.

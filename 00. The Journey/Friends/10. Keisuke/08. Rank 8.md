The scratching of pencils echoes   
throughout the art room...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Let's see, on cleaning duty today is... Hiraga-senpai and you, Arisato-kun. Thanks for your help!   
   
Male Club Member   
All right, we're outta here!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Okay, let's make this quick.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
This room's smaller than my bedroom, but it's still surprisingly big.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Let's take a break.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
So, Arisato-kun, I've decided that I'm going to study abroad.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
To be honest, I'm not really excited about it.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
But I already told my teacher I don't want to be a doctor, so...   
......   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
D-Do you want something to drink? It's on me.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - Oh, I almost forgot. Did you want something cold, or maybe—   
   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Surprised - Hey! Look out!   
   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Angry - Hey, Arisato-kun! Hang in there! Can you hear me? Arisato-ku...

Hiraga's voice sounds like it's   
getting farther and farther away...

Keisuke Hiraga   
Surprised - You're awake! Oh, thank goodness!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sad - I kept calling your name, but you wouldn't wake up, so I...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
My head is throbbing...   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sad - I don't see any cuts on your head, so I don't think you'll need stitches.   
Sad - Can you remember your name?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's okay, I'm fine.   
Of course. It's Keisuke.   
......   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Happy - That's wonderful to hear. Really, it's such a relief.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Angry - Keisu— Hey, that's me! Come on, that's not funny!   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sad - A-Are you okay!? Is your vision still blurry?   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sad - Well, your pupils aren't dilated, so I don't think you have a concussion.   
Sad - I was worried that when you fell, you hit your head or your face, and I...   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sad - A-Anyway, do you remember what happened?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I do.   
I don't.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sad - The box... I was the one who put it up there.   
Looking away - We have a maid who cleans our house, so I don't do much cleaning myself. And I just got lazy and put it up there.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sad - A box fell and hit you on the head.   
Looking away - And I was the one who put it up there.   
Looking away - We have a maid who cleans our house, so I don't do much cleaning myself. And I just got lazy and put it up there.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sad - It's all my fault. I'm so sorry...   
Sad - All I could think about was what would happen if you didn't wake up. I was so scared.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Looking away - I felt so helpless seeing my friend in trouble and not being able to do anything.   
Looking away - I'm not a doctor...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Do you think you want to be one?   
Don't beat yourself up about it.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Looking away - ......   
Looking away - When I was younger, my dad told me a sad story.   
Looking away - About how he lost a good friend... He just collapsed one day, even though they played together all the time.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Sad - Seeing you lying there, I understood how my dad must've felt losing someone he was so close to.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
You're really tough, Arisato-kun.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Ms. Toriumi told me about what happened to your parents.   
But me... My parents are always there when I get home. Maybe I take them for granted.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
You know, seeing you lying there, I think I understood what it must feel like to lose someone close to you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hiraga seems to care about me.   
I feel like we're becoming better friends.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Looking away - Do I... want to be a doctor? But I'd be doing exactly what my dad wants.   
   
Keisuke Hiraga   
Ah, sorry.   
Happy - We should get going. Can you walk? Here, you can lean on me.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Hiraga and I left school together.

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, Arisato-kun. Good timing!   
Happy - I was just about to invite Yukari-chan and Junpei-kun to study.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - So I was wondering if you'd like to join too.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's study together.   
What's everyone's status?   
I want to go to Tartarus.   
No thanks.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Really? Thanks! I'll go ask the others!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh... That's too bad. Well, if you feel up for it, just let me know, okay?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, did you change your mind about studying with us?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
How about it?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's study together.   
I want to go to Tartarus.   
No thanks.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Really? Thanks! I'll go ask the others!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, okay... Well, I'll be here if you change your mind.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh, well, I don't mind... But some of the others may want to study today.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I still want to go.   
Never mind, then.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Everyone can go tonight.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Can I help you with something else?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
All right, then...   
I'll let everyone know. See you later.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I think that's for the best too.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Right now, the Temperance Arcana   
may help me grow even more...

Yukari Takeba   
Oh, I think I forgot my eraser back in my room... Junpei, I'm borrowing yours for a sec.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Whoa, hold on! Only the flat side, okay? It's brand new. You've gotta keep the corners sharp...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Huh? What's the big deal? It's just an eraser.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - An eraser's corners are a special privilege reserved for the owner! A precious and fleeting source of euphoria!   
Exasperated* - Didn't you learn that when you were a kid? One man's eraser is another man's treasure!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Ugh, I don't have time for this...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - C'mon, Fuuka, do you get what I'm sayin' here? You're laughing, but this is a serious matter!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Hehe... Oh, sorry. It just crossed my mind how peaceful things are.   
Happy - It's strange that just being able to study with everyone like this can make me feel so... happy.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Yeah... I know what you mean.   
Exasperated* - It makes me wonder if this might be the last time we ever get to do this...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Uh, just kidding! Sorry, forget I said that! I was just... thinking about next year.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
We'll do this next year, too.   
No use dwelling on it.   
You like studying that much?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah... I guess that's the way to think about it. If I go in expecting the worst, I'm just going to shut down.   
Happy - Thanks. That makes me feel a little better.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Huh...?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Haha, maybe you have a point... It's not like obsessing over it's going to change anything.   
Happy - Well, that took a little weight off my shoulders. Time to concentrate on getting ready for those exams!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - That's... not really what I meant.   
Happy - Haha, you're a real goof sometimes, Arisato-kun... I never know what to expect out of you in a time like this.   
But... thanks. I think I needed that.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Alright! Time to get back to studying! Oh, Fuuka, can I have some lead for my pencil?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh, sure. You can take some from this one.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Thankies! Oh, Minato, lemme borrow your highlighter for a sec.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
We all concentrated on studying...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey Yuka-tan... Mind if I borrow your ruler?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I guess, but... why have you been borrowing all of our stuff? Don't you have your own?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Listen... When I heard you forgot your eraser, something just hit me.   
The simple act of helpin' each other out is like... That's what it's all about, y'know? That's... happiness.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Junpei-kun...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - You say that, but you probably just forgot to bring all your stuff, didn't you?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Ahaha... Busted!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Thank you for studying with me, everyone. I hope we can do this again.

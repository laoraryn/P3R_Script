I answered correctly...      
Everyone in the class is      
looking at me with respect...      
      
Minato Arisato - Thoughts      
I answered incorrectly...      
      
Mr. Ono      
That's enough about mammoths... I don't see the big deal. They're just huge elephants.      
Well, that wraps it up for the Stone Age. *sigh* I'm tired of these lessons about fossils.      
I'd rather talk about the Sengoku era! Japanese history's not exciting enough until then.      
But, it's what I'm paid to do, so here we are... It's not easy being an adult.      
      
Mr. Ono      
Next is... the Jomon period? When do the samurai get their day in the sun!?      
I'll just ask a question at random and call it a day. Hmm... Arisato-kun.      
      
Mr. Ono      
The places where people dumped their waste in the Jomon period—what are they called nowadays?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
Boneyards.      
Middens.      
Hovels.      
      
Mr. Ono      
That's right, they're called "middens." The word is Scandinavian in origin and means "dung hill."      
...Eh, that didn't work. Still not interested in this at all.      
      
Mr. Ono      
*sigh* It's no use teaching you guys if you're going to get the simplest questions wrong.      
The correct answer is "midden." The word is Scandinavian in origin and means "dung hill."      
Well, I suppose that isn't important here, ultimately.      
      
Mr. Ono      
Ugh, I wanna get to the age of katanas! Everything else is so dull...

Ms. Ounishi      
*sigh* I don't really feel like teaching today...      
Last night, I was watching TV when I saw a special on trains.      
Traveling by train is always nice, isn't it? Staying in a sleeper car is a traveler's dream.      
Speaking of trains, let's talk about the rhombus-shaped instrument on the roof of the train.      
      
Ms. Ounishi      
Power is generated when this device comes into contact with the overhead wires...      
You look like you know what I'm talking about, Arisato. Let's see if that's the case.      
      
Ms. Ounishi      
What do you call the device that helps generate electric power for the train?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
A pantograph.      
A piston.      
A master controller.      
      
Ms. Ounishi      
That's right. You're better informed than I thought. Or perhaps you're simply a railfan?      
      
Ms. Ounishi      
Incorrect. It's called a "pantograph."      
      
Ms. Ounishi      
Most modern trains take in electricity by bringing the pantograph into contact with the overhead wires.      
However, the monorail we use has the pantograph hidden under the train instead...

Mr. Takenozuka      
Let's discuss the Earth's rotation today.      
The Earth completes one full rotation every 24 hours...      
      
Mr. Takenozuka      
All right, don't fall asleep on me now. This may be basic, but it's an important premise for the rest of the lesson.      
Let's see, hmm... Arisato?      
      
Mr. Takenozuka      
Do you know Léon Foucault? He's a French physicist who performed experiments regarding the rotation of the Earth.      
Which tool did he use in his experiments?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
The hourglass.      
The pendulum.      
The planisphere.      
      
Mr. Takenozuka      
Yes, a pendulum. The device he built has become eponymized as the Foucault pendulum, with full-scale replicas installed around the world.      
      
Mr. Takenozuka      
No, it was a pendulum. The device he built has become eponymized as the Foucault pendulum, with full-scale replicas installed around the world.      
      
Mr. Takenozuka      
Flip to the next page— Oh, this is an application. Let's skip that and... Hmm, that's an experiment. Okay, um...

Mrs. Terauchi      
Let's look at the paragraph on page 30, shall we?      
"Kate was feeling a bit depressed today, but Jessie invited her to tea."      
Has everyone been feeling all right lately? Considering the season we're in now...      
      
Mrs. Terauchi      
Yes, "May sickness" is a real phenomenon. We've made it through the brunt of it, but it may still be lingering!      
Now, who's ready for a little question?      
      
Mrs. Terauchi      
Mr. Arisato, you're up!      
What's the other name for "May sickness"—the more casual one?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
May days.      
May blues.      
Moody blues.      
      
Mrs. Terauchi      
Excellent job!      
It's believed that the sudden change in schedule at one's new office or school brings about stress and a depressive mood. Thus, we get the May blues.      
      
Mrs. Terauchi      
Nope. Good try, though!      
It's believed that the sudden change in schedule at one's new office or school brings about stress and a depressive mood. Thus, we get the May blues.      
      
Mrs. Terauchi      
That'll be on the exam, so make sure you write it down!      
We've still got a couple minutes left... Let's talk about my experience studying in India.      
      
---      
      
Ms. Toriumi      
Our language can be awfully complex...      
Don't you hate when you know the meaning of a word, but you can't remember the word itself?      
...This feels like a good time for a spontaneous question.      
      
Ms. Toriumi      
Let's see... Iori's shifting in his seat a bit too much, so instead...      
      
Ms. Toriumi      
How about you, Arisato-kun?      
Which phrase means, "able to see things for what they really are"?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
Keen eye.      
Mean eye.      
Bright eyes.      
      
Ms. Toriumi      
Happy - That's correct! You may very well have a keen eye yourself.      
      
Ms. Toriumi      
Bzzt, nope! If you don't develop a keen eye for the truth, you'll find yourself easily tricked.      
      
Ms. Toriumi      
Having a keen eye means you're able to see things for what they really are. It can also help you make good decisions for your future.      
That goes for the rest of you, too—you need to learn how to look past the surface. Otherwise, you'll grow up to be superficial.      
      
---      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
All right, let's begin. "Palas Aron Azinomas"...      
We all need to start somewhere. Rome wasn't built in a day!      
The same goes for magic. You ought to learn its background.      
Today, I'll teach you about the origin of magic.      
Long, long ago, at the dawn of civilization, man created primitive religions.      
Animism, totemism, and shamanism all fall into this category. You learned these in world history, right?      
That last one, shamanism, is important to the origins of magic.      
A shaman would fall into a trance state and act as the intermediary between the worlds, but...      
It counts as "magic," where humans can have the power of gods and spirits in their own hands.      
This shaman-style magical tradition would later be embraced by witches.      
Take the common European witch, as an example.      
People today think that witches derive their power from contracts with the devil...      
But that's just Christian propaganda.      
The witches' predecessors were more like maidens serving the gods.      
It was through prayer to those gods that they earned their powers.      
They learned to control their magic without losing consciousness during their trance states.      
That's how they originally awoke to the practice.      
Happy - Originally, Europe was full of religions, worshiping a slew of various gods.      
The collective term for them is "paganism."      
Interestingly enough, the celebrations of Christmas and Halloween have pagan backgrounds.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Happy - Are you all still paying attention? No trance states for now! Eeeheehee...      
Happy - Here's a test to see if you were paying attention.      
Get it wrong, and your afterlife won't be pleasant. "Palas Aron Azinomas"...      
Now, who should I pick...? I choose thee, Arisato!      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
What early religious practice was the origin of magic?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
Totemism.      
Animism.      
Shamanism.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Very good... You'll be born in your next life as a human.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Wrong! Enjoy your next life as a chupacabra.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
So, paganism and Christianity have a closer connection than one might think.      
As the Roman Empire grew, so did the Christian population within the empire.      
At first, each religion practiced separately without issue, but...      
      
---      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Please sit down so we can begin today's lecture. "Ada Ada Io Ada Dia"...      
I know you were expecting Mrs. Terauchi, but she's had an emergency. I'll be taking over class today.      
We're going to learn a bit about natural magic.      
It's not too dissimilar to paganism, which we've already discussed.      
Natural magic is, obviously enough, magic that draws its power from nature.      
The most popular form of this would probably be herbalism.      
Calendar-based spells are also a form of natural magic, since they involve the seasons.      
Now, some of you may already be familiar with dowsing, which uses a pendulum or rod to find things underground.      
This too is a form of natural magic, first used to detect sources of water.      
That's enough examples for now. Let's move on to the proper mindset for natural magic.      
First, you must recognize yourself as a part of nature and accept its power.      
In other words, think of humanity as a microscopic player within the cosmology of the universe.      
This mindset is based on the concept of the four classical elements.      
Ancient magicians believed that different objects sharing a common element would react to one another.      
They performed countless experiments attempting to prove their hypotheses about nature.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Happy - Are you all listening? I certainly hope so! Eeeheehee...      
Happy - Here's a little test to see if you were paying attention...      
You'll receive an ill omen if you get it wrong. "Ada Ada Io Ada Dia"...      
Now, who to pick today...? Arisato! You have been called upon!      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
What form of natural magic is used to find water sources?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
Dowsing.      
Divining.      
Channeling.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Excellent work—your answer is correct. As for your omen, no news is good news.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
I'm afraid that's not it. Watch out for the letter that arrives at midnight...      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
But, back to the main subject—prayer is considered integral to many forms of natural magic.      
One characteristic of natural magic prayer is that much of it is in praise of the earth goddess.      
This ties into the concept of natural magic as a way of invoking nature's blessing.      
As time passed, natural magic developed into natural science.      
In this transition, though, a key element was lost...      
The notion of "time" being controllable.      
Natural magic forbids the use of spells that go against the standard flow of time.      
Its practitioners believe that magic should not defy nature, and to this day, take great care to follow natural law.

Ms. Toriumi      
Let's see here... **Finals start next Tuesday**. Geez, we just had an exam! What a pain...      
Well, maybe "pain" isn't the right word... Some phrases can be pretty tricky.      
Now, let's talk about comma splices.      
      
Ms. Toriumi      
I'm sure you've all heard of them before, but just to be clear...      
A comma splice is when two independent clauses are incorrectly joined by a comma instead of a conjunction.      
      
Ms. Toriumi      
Here's a question for you all! Dun dun dunnn... Arisato-kun!      
Where is the comma splice found in the following sentence?      
"Because it is 10:30 right now, we will not reach the theater in time, it's already started, to my dismay."      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
Between "now" and "we."      
Between "time" and "it's."      
Between "started" and "to."      
      
Ms. Toriumi      
Ah! Correct! The middle one is the inaccurately-used comma.      
      
Ms. Toriumi      
Bzzzzt! The inaccurately-used comma is between "time" and "it's."      
      
Ms. Toriumi      
Regardless of how logical the sentence flow may appear...      
A comma cannot be used to link two independent clauses.      
That's a comma splice.      
Got it?      
Angry - ...Well, if no one has any questions, let's move on.      
      
---      
      
Mr. Ono      
Let's talk about the Heian era today. I won't spend a lot of time on this, so pay attention.      
In 794, the Heian-Kyo was established. In 894, they abolished imperial embassies to China...      
I might put this section on the exam next week... I'm feeling lazy.      
      
Mr. Ono      
Anyway, on to feudalism. Listen carefully, because this has to do with the origins of the samurai!      
I choose... you, Arisato! Let's see what you know.      
      
Mr. Ono      
So, the law permitting permanent ownership of newly-cultivated land served as a foundation for the development of feudalism.      
Thanks to this decree, a lot of land was cultivated...      
At the same time, a serious problem arose for the farmers. Do you remember what that was?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
Land invasion.      
Environmental destruction.      
Social disparity.      
      
Mr. Ono      
Yep, you got it!      
      
Mr. Ono      
Wrooong! It was social disparity.      
C'mon, you can do better than that! You're descended from the samurai!      
      
Mr. Ono      
The work doesn't end after you plow the land. It costs a lot of money to build waterways and stuff on top of that.      
So, the farmers with more wealth and authority could make more money by expanding their lands...      
On the other hand, those who weren't as affluent had no choice but to remain poor—it's the same old story throughout time.      
Well, that's all for the Heian period.      
      
---      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Silence! Class is beginning. "Uriel, Rilue, Ilili, Eulir, Leiru"...      
Just a quick preface: when I use the word "magic," I mean it in a very general sense.      
Anyway, today's topic is the magic of medieval Europe.      
I'll be giving a crash course on the single most magical place and time in recorded history.      
So, there are a lot of materials pertaining to Western magic, from printed books to communal folklore.      
I'll cover all of it, including the changes European magic has seen since then.      
As I mentioned previously, European magic finds its origins in paganism.      
Starting with Christianity, though, it has been influenced by an influx of various cultures.      
Let's see, what are some well-known examples...?      
There's Kabbalah, which is the esoteric study of mystical aspects of Jewish texts.      
There's also Gnosticism, a Christian sect founded by Simon Magus, the Sorcerer.      
Greece's philosophy and natural sciences were the fruits of magical researchers...      
And the same was true of Islam's scientific advances, which surpassed Europe's at the time.      
Now, as for the circumstances of magic in this age...      
It was an era where the rule of Christianity and the insight of the natural sciences collided.      
Magicians bravely reached up for a connection with the gods...      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Happy - Say, are you still awake? You're not daydreaming, right? Eeeheehee...      
How about a test to see if you were paying attention?      
You'll know what type of guardian angel you have, depending on how you answer. "Uriel, Rilue, Ilili, Eulir, Leiru"...      
Now, who to call upon...? I choose thee, Arisato!      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
What is the esoteric study of Jewish texts called?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
Lemegeton.      
Gnosticism.      
Kabbalah.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Very good. Thank your guardian angel, because they must be kind.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Wrong! You've got a fallen samurai from Okehazama for a guardian angel.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
The magicians of the age achieved great things...      
Particularly the renowned "grimoires."      
A grimoire is a collection of magical texts, usually as all-encompassing as possible, wherein...      
      
---      
      
Mr. Ono      
Here we go! Finally, we've reached Taira no Masakado! He's the turning point of the era of the samurai!      
      
Mr. Ono      
It all began with infighting among the Taira clan. Their conflict escalated until the Imperial Court had to intervene.      
Masakado was pursued by the Imperial Court, so he had no choice but to openly oppose them...      
The result was known as the War of Masakado.      
Arisato! You may not look like a samurai, but let's see if you know this one anyway.      
      
Mr. Ono      
There's a theory that Taira no Masakado thought up the prototype for an item essential to battle.      
Now, what do you think that item was? It's something every samurai needs!      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
The katana.      
Armor.      
The rifle.      
      
Mr. Ono      
Knew that one already, huh? Yep, it's the katana!      
Think of samurai and their swords are the first thing that come to mind! Although, it's not known whether Masakado really came up with them.      
      
Mr. Ono      
...No, it's the katana. Seems pretty obvious why, doesn't it?      
Think of samurai and their swords are the first thing that come to mind! Although, it's not known whether Masakado really came up with them.      
      
Mr. Ono      
This is going to be on the **exam next week**, so prepare well!      
Let's skip forward a little to the Kamakura era.      
Ah, at last! I can feel them on their way... The samurai are almost here...!      
In 1185, the Kamakura shogunate was established. Yes! We're there!      
And of course, its founder was Minamoto no Yoritomo... I can't believe we finally made it!

Mr. Takenozuka      
All right, quiet down! Summer vacation's over! You're back in school now, so act accordingly!      
We'll never get through the full textbook if you stay in vacation mode forever.      
      
Mr. Takenozuka      
Okay, let's review. Arisato...      
      
Mr. Takenozuka      
Which property of electricity is relevant to superconductivity?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
Voltage.      
Resistance.      
Current.      
      
Mr. Takenozuka      
That's right! Been studying, I see...      
Anything that reaches an electrical resistance of zero at a characteristic temperature is considered superconductive.      
      
Mr. Takenozuka      
Still in vacation mode, are we?      
Superconductors are materials capable, at the right temperature, of reaching zero electrical resistance. Resistance is correct!      
      
Mr. Takenozuka      
As a result, electric currents can travel eternally through a superconductive circuit held at the proper temperature.      
......      
Many years ago, I used this fact to confess my love to someone...      
"My love for you is superconductive!" I told them.      
......      
Sure enough, my enthusiasm won her over, and we started dating...      
But enthusiasm isn't very scientific. Before too long, I'd lost interest in her.      
All right, in the next section...      
      
---      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Hello, class. "Bagahi Laca Bachabe"...      
Are you ready? Then, let's begin. Today, we'll discuss the magic of the Renaissance era.      
The Renaissance was a time when the arts and the sciences enjoyed a strong resurgence in Europe.      
Of course, this had a profound influence on magic...      
Although it may be more accurate to say the two studies helped improve one another.      
As to why the Renaissance helped to further magic...      
Practitioners had finally nailed down a way to escape the rule of the church.      
By studying the teachings of previously-inaccessible sects, knowledge of magic flourished, possibly like never before.      
The Renaissance also brought about the revival of ancient Greek and Roman literature.      
Magical texts, such as the Hermetica, received all-new translations and increased study.      
Philosophy, natural history, alchemy, astrology...      
This book is filled with a wide range of subjects. Some even consider it the bible of magic.      
Just as science and astronomy have made strides in the modern day...      
So, too, has the art of magic.      
You can see this in the emergence of one of the great magicians of all history—one who put the knowledge of the Renaissance into application.      
John Dee was a professor who advised the Queen of England, but...      
With the magical knowledge he uncovered, he was able to communicate with angels.      
Of course, there was also Hohenheim, a doctor who traveled across Europe...      
He became known as Paracelsus, a renowned physician and alchemist.      
Granted, the magician's life wasn't an easy one back then...      
Both men dealt with great amounts of persecution in their lives.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Happy - Are you still listening? Even your astral selves need to pay attention! Eeeheehee...      
Here's a test to see if you were paying attention.      
Get it wrong and your house will become permanently haunted. "Bagahi Laca Bachabe"...      
Who to pick this time...? I choose thee, Arisato!      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Which book helped further the art of magic during the Renaissance?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
The Book of Enoch.      
The Book of Thoth.      
The Hermetica.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Correct. Enjoy sleeping in your peaceful home tonight.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Wrong! Now you'll see a woman's face in the ceiling of your room...      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
During the Renaissance, magic had a surprisingly strong influence on the church-ruled society.      
Several magicians were even involved in the core part of the Renaissance—the religious revolution...

Mrs. Terauchi      
We're starting a new chapter today. This one is all about Nick's tough situation.      
You know, the story reminds me of when I first met my husband. What a wild time that was!      
      
Mrs. Terauchi      
At first, we were somewhat distant, but after spending enough time together...      
One day, I suddenly realized that he was my better half.      
      
Mrs. Terauchi      
Ooh, I just came up with a good question! Mr. Arisato, since our eyes met first...      
Who is one referring to when speaking of their "better half"?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
Their soulmate.      
Their rival.      
Their mentor.      
      
Mrs. Terauchi      
Yes, wonderful! Your "better half" is considered your soulmate—the person you are destined to be with!      
      
Mrs. Terauchi      
No, no, no. Your "better half" is considered your soulmate—the person you are destined to be with!      
      
Mrs. Terauchi      
Someone who you never want to leave, and will treasure always...      
I believe whoever makes you feel this way is your soulmate.      
Someday, if ever you meet someone who makes you feel like that...      
Accept your feelings—and your better half—with open arms.      
...Wow, look at the time! Let's get back to the lesson.      
      
---      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Take your seats and we'll begin. "Hi-fu-mi-yo-i-mu-na-ya-ko-to-mo-chi-ro-ra-ne"...      
This is... math class normally, yes?      
Well, Mr. Miyahara is feeling under the weather, so I'll be filling in for him.      
Since you came expecting a math lesson, I'll be talking about numerology.      
Numerology is a type of magic which sees the world through a system of numbers.      
Essentially, its practitioners convert matter into numbers.      
Numbers have power, so numerologists merely take advantage of that power.      
Some say the first true numerologist was Pythagoras.      
You may know him from the Pythagorean Theorem, but he's also quite famous for practicing magic.      
He and his pupils researched what is now called Pythagoreanism.      
They realized that everything existing in this world corresponds to a number.      
They considered odd numbers masculine, and even numbers feminine.      
They also worked towards verifying the existence of holy and unholy numbers.      
The Pythagoreans focused on the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, because they add up to 10, which represents completion.      
They considered those first four numbers to be holy numbers, the most important of all.      
They're known as the Tetractys.      
Later, others would build upon the numerological foundation that the Pythagoreans laid.      
Even recently, studies have been performed on the relationship between names and numbers.      
Let's look at this a little closer, shall we?      
Let me teach you a method to interpret your own name's meaning.      
Be sure to include your middle name, too!      
Now, convert each letter of your name into a number—1 for A, 2 for B, and so on—then add the numbers together.      
If a letter has a two-digit number, like 14 for N, first add the two digits together to make a single digit.      
Keep adding these digits together until you're down to a final number between 1 and 9.      
Upon learning or reflecting on that digit's properties, you can conclude the characteristics of the person in question.      
Basically, your number represents your general personality.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Happy - Say, are you still listening? I hope all this talk of numbers hasn't put you to sleep! Eeeheehee...      
Here's a test to see if you were paying attention...      
Get it wrong and the numbers will haunt you, even in your sleep! "Hi-fu-mi-yo-i-mu-na-ya-ko-to-mo-chi-ro-ra-ne"...      
Now, who to pick...? Arisato, I choose thee!      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
What is the collective name for the four holy numbers in numerology?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
Tetrodotoxin.      
Tetrakarn.      
Tetractys.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
That's correct. The actuarial tables predict a happy future for you...      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Alas, no. Unfortunately, your sales tax at the school store will now increase by 25%.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
A bit more on numerology and names before you're dismissed...      
Numerology can also be used to discern your inner self, your public persona, your future, and so on.      
Convert the vowels in your name into numbers, then add them up. That reveals your inner self.      
Next, do the consonants in your name to get the persona you display in public.      
Using this same method on your birth date will calculate your future...      
But make sure you use Christian Era dates in this calculation.      
It's also possible to assess your compatibility with another person using numerology.      
By adding the digits of your birth date to the other's, you can...

Ms. Ounishi      
**Exams start next Tuesday**, but I'd rather spend the time doing experiments.      
The precise moment when two chemical agents come into contact... It's so exciting!      
I'm sure you all find experiments more exciting than just sitting in a chair, listening to me talk, right?      
      
Ms. Ounishi      
Well, complaining about it won't do anything for us. All right, here's a question to get you motivated.      
      
Ms. Ounishi      
How about you, Arisato? Your turn to answer my question today.      
Which hormone is the one in your brain that provides a sense of achievement?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
Melatonin.      
Dopamine.      
Histamine.      
      
Ms. Ounishi      
Oh... Well, yes, that's correct.      
      
Ms. Ounishi      
Haha, teaching wouldn't be any fun if students knew everything! The answer is "dopamine."      
      
Ms. Ounishi      
Dopamine's an important hormone that gives us a sense of accomplishment, joy, and excitement, which drives to motivate us.      
However, if it's overproduced repeatedly, that can lead to addiction.      
It's the same as other chemicals used in experiments, and many things in life. Moderation is key—make sure you remember that.      
      
---      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Okay, time to get started. Exams are coming up...      
Ready for today's lesson? "Ahah Adonai Tetragrammaton"...      
We've covered the time of magical growth and just about reached the modern age.      
And just as every art or science branches off into sub-studies as it progresses...      
Magic began subdividing around the 18th century.      
Some people preached of morals, some focused on communicating with spirits, etcetera.      
There was even the man who founded modern psychology based on his research into hypnosis.      
This, too, is magic: the ability to see into the human mind.      
As a result of magical research's flourishing, witch hunts grew more common...      
To avoid this, the practice went "underground" to secret societies.      
I'm sure many of you have heard the names of at least some of these organizations.      
The Rosicrucian Order, the Freemasons, the Illuminati, the Golden Dawn...      
Interestingly enough, many of these societies are still with us today.      
As for the forefathers of modern magic, they are simply too numerous to count.      
For instance, there's Éliphas Lévi, a man who attempted to combine modern and ancient systems of magic.      
His literature, which took a scientific approach, is still being published to this day.      
Madam Blavatsky was a renowned magician of the 19th century and the figurehead of Theosophy in her lifetime.      
Many magical societies stemmed from the Theosophical Society, which Blavatsky founded with a few close associates.      
Franz Mesmer opened the path to psychology in his studies on life energy...      
And Rudolf Steiner, once a member of the Theosophical Society, founded anthroposophy, which he called a "spiritual science."      
There was Aleister Crowley, of course, the 20th century's most well-known magician...      
And George Gurdjieff, a mystic who taught his many students the Fourth Way, also known as "The Work" or "The System."      
Each one of them was a living archive of esoteric knowledge.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Happy - Are you still hearing me? Not frozen with fear, I trust? Eeeheehee...      
Allow me to test if you were paying attention.      
Get it wrong and your sign will change. "Ahah Adonai Tetragrammaton"...      
Now, who to pick...? Arisato, answer as thou wilt!      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Who was the founder of Theosophy, a group that gave rise to many other magical societies?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
Éliphas Lévi.      
Helena Blavatsky.      
Aleister Crowley.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Very good. Remember to still get blessed on your unlucky years, though.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Wrong! Your sign is now the cat—your year will never come!      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
At any rate, the magical arts progressed even further with their practical use.      
Thanks to the archiving and proliferation of these arts by the people we've covered today...      
      
---      
      
Mr. Miyahara      
...Then round up, like this, and... the answer is X=1.      
Hmm? It isn't? Oh, I see—this becomes 11, so... X=2.      
Hang on, what? Okay, uh, your assignment is to figure this one out.      
      
Mr. Miyahara      
Anyway, wasn't that fun? Numbers are so interesting!      
Even with a difficult problem like this one, once it's solved, it becomes such a simple concept.      
Our entire reality is made up of numbers. Civilization owes its very existence to math!      
All right, Arisato-kun, you seem like a math fan—here's a question for you.      
      
Mr. Miyahara      
We used the number "zero" a lot. Do you know where it originally came from, though?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
Egypt.      
India.      
Rome.      
      
Mr. Miyahara      
That's right! You really must be a math fan!      
      
Mr. Miyahara      
Too bad! The correct answer is "India." I guess you aren't really that big a math fan, huh?      
      
Mr. Miyahara      
Isn't it fascinating how someone just up and conceived the concept of emptiness one day?      
Thus, with the birth of the zero, all of mathematics took an enormous leap forward.      
Ahhh... The beauty and wonder of it all! Math is MAGNIFICENT!

Mrs. Terauchi      
...Just compare the names used for months in Japanese and English—the latter is a mess! October is tenth? Come on now!      
So, everyone knows about Julius Caesar, right? Well, it's not just his fault that the English names for months are off...      
      
Mrs. Terauchi      
Did you know that his name is actually the origin of the word July?      
Many people and gods have had their names used this way throughout history. Isn't it interesting to see how a person can affect entire languages?      
      
Mrs. Terauchi      
Here's a question, Minato...      
Which Roman goddess has been theorized as the namesake for the month of April?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
Diana.      
Minerva.      
Venus.      
      
Mrs. Terauchi      
Yes, you got it! That was a tough one, too!      
Some have speculated that April was originally called "Aphrilis," named after Aphrodite, the Greek name for the goddess Venus.      
      
Mrs. Terauchi      
Aw, too bad! That was a tough one, though. The answer is "Venus."      
Some have speculated that April was originally called "Aphrilis," named after Aphrodite, the Greek name for the goddess Venus.      
      
Mrs. Terauchi      
Others believe it may be derived from a Latin verb meaning "to open."      
They argue that April is the beginning of the season where flowers and other plants begin to open up.      
I, however, prefer my word origins to have a bit more of a romantic flair! Here's another example...      
      
---      
      
Ms. Toriumi      
*yawn* I stayed up a bit too late last night.      
I didn't expect Mrs. Terauchi to pull such a legendary move in mahjong last night... I've never had that bad of luck before!      
      
Ms. Toriumi      
Is it because of the month? Ugh... I still can't get over it!      
Who should I ask this one...? You, Arisato-kun.      
      
Ms. Toriumi      
In most of Japan, October is considered "the month without gods" because they're not around...      
But there's one region that instead calls it "the month with gods," because that's where they all go! Do you know which one it is?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
Dotonbori.      
Izumo.      
Ise.      
      
Ms. Toriumi      
Bingo! You hit the jackpot.      
      
Ms. Toriumi      
Too bad... The answer is Izumo.      
      
Ms. Toriumi      
All of the gods in Japan gather each year in Izumo to meet and forge relationships with one another.      
I want to be blessed with a loving relationship too... But first, I need some money, and then to find love, and then to work hard...      
So I guess the first thing is, I need to go to Naganaki Shrine to pay my respects... Oh! It's already too late. Shoot!      
      
---      
      
Ms. Ounishi      
The next chapter is about enzymes. Worried it'll go over your head?      
Well, have no fear. You're already familiar with the main places enzymes can be found—your own body.      
      
Ms. Ounishi      
Let's see if you can tell the class, Arisato...      
      
Ms. Ounishi      
Here's a question about sweet potatoes.      
A certain enzyme brings out the sweetness in them when they're baked. Do you happen to know what it is?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
Beta-amylase.      
Lactase.      
Glucose.      
      
Ms. Ounishi      
Yep, that's it. Eat a lot of sweet potatoes, do you?      
      
Ms. Ounishi      
Incorrect. The answer is beta-amylase.      
      
Ms. Ounishi      
When the beta-amylase in sweet potatoes breaks down the gelatinized starch...      
It becomes a malt sugar called maltose. That's why heating sweet potatoes up makes them even sweeter.      
The temperature at which beta-amylase is activated is said to be roughly 60 to 70 degrees Celsius...      
Which is why a slowly-baked potato is sweeter than one that was rapidly heated, like with steam.      
      
---      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Now, we begin! "Om Vajra Ratna Om"...      
Today, we'll be examining regional forms of magic...      
First up is India, one of the birthplaces of magic.      
You may not think of India as an especially magical place, but...      
It most assuredly is.      
Consider how esoteric Buddhist magic came from India...      
It was a definite influence on Gnosticism, and a foundation of modern-day theosophy.      
It's even said that the Upanishads, part of the Vedas, are the original books of magic.      
Many ancient Indians were passionate in their search for magic.      
These Indian magicians emerged in similar circumstances as other places around the world.      
In India, it's traditional to lead a pious life...      
But eventually, some people claimed to have gained immense power through Tapasya.      
At first, their claims were rejected, but they slowly gained power and numbers...      
Eventually, they were accepted into common practice.      
These are the ascetics mentioned in the Upanishads.      
However, any normal human wouldn't be readily able to mimic their skills.      
Those known as the Tapasa have surpassed the limitations of humanity.      
Do you think you could fast and pray for months at a time, without eating or sleeping?      
You'd die before attaining any powers at all!      
So, it's understandable that the Buddha rejected such extreme asceticism.      
Of course, the Upanishads aren't all about such radical practices.      
They contain very practical methods, too. Yoga, for instance, was also introduced through these scriptures.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Happy - Say, are you all listening? No out-of-body projections, now! Eeeheehee...      
How about a test to see if you were paying attention?      
Get it wrong and you'd better be ready for a heaping dose of bad karma. "Om Vajra Ratna Om"...      
Now, who should I pick? I choose thee... Arisato!      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
What is the ancient Indian magical text I mentioned today?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
The Upanishads.      
The Mahabharata.      
The Ramayana.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Correct! You still need to live an honest life, though—I can't pile on any good karma.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Wrong! You get a whole year's worth of the principal's karma!      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Moving on... There are many different schools of yoga, and near-countless asanas, or poses, being taught.      
Some asanas are for health, while others are for prayer.      
One important branch is Hatha yoga, a type of yoga that many people are already familiar with today.      
In this branch, one cultivates a healthy body to attain purity of mind...      
      
---      
      
Mr. Ekoda      
It's November already... The third-year students must be cramming frantically by this point.      
Don't worry, though—you'll share their fate next year. I can just see you now, tearing your hair out...      
Anyway, it's a bit cold today, but there's no need for the heater. Let me tell you why...      
      
Mr. Ekoda      
Winter is supposed to be cold—you have to learn to appreciate the temperature, rather than curse it.      
That's the Japanese way. Do you understand me? You don't, do you?      
As Sei Shonagon once wrote in her famous Pillow Book, "Winter, early mornings."      
      
Mr. Ekoda      
Hmm, let's see... Arisato.      
What was she describing with such a sparse line?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
Her favorite time in winter.      
The setting of the plot.      
Instructions for the reader.      
      
Mr. Ekoda      
So you do have some basic sense...      
      
Mr. Ekoda      
Have you been paying any attention? Just return from a trip to dreamland, maybe?      
      
Mr. Ekoda      
The author was describing her favorite time in winter. She's now famous for having written about her likes, dislikes, and other observations.      
She admires what the snow represents: the beauty of the winter frost.      
Rather than curse the winter chill, she appreciated its positive qualities.      
Oh, how wonderful Japanese culture is! Despite its modern youth, anyway...      
And if you think my hair's frosty, remember that you'll eventually be just like me!      
      
---      
      
Mr. Ekoda      
Oh, what a sublime heroine Murasaki-no-Ue is!      
She was written to be the ideal woman of the Heian period—the quintessential Heian beauty.      
      
Mr. Ekoda      
Speaking of Murasaki-no-Ue, here's a question for you, Arisato...      
      
Mr. Ekoda      
In the Tale of Genji, Murasaki-no-Ue is portrayed as a woman of the highest class in terms of appearance, intelligence, and character.      
In the poem that Genji, the protagonist, sends to her, what did he compare her to?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
The cherry blossom.      
A cat.      
The hydrangea.      
      
Mr. Ekoda      
Hmph, I suppose it was an easy question...      
      
Mr. Ekoda      
Hmph, wrong! The answer is "cherry blossom."      
      
Mr. Ekoda      
"It means that the image of you, as beautiful as the wild cherry blossom, will never leave my mind..."      
How refined! Compared to them, you guys are nothing but...      
      
---      
      
Ms. Ounishi      
*sigh* It's December already?      
It's almost the end of the year—let's not ruin our last month this year with laziness, okay?      
Oh, that's right—**exams start next Monday**! Though, didn't we just have them not too long ago...?      
The material on the exam begins on page 160, and will include today's lesson as well.      
      
Ms. Ounishi      
Let's see... How about we go over the definition of allotropy?      
"The property of certain elements that can exist in two or more forms that are chemically identical, yet physically discrete."      
Does that make sense? Well, allotropy is very common—more common than you might think! Like oxygen, for example.      
      
Ms. Ounishi      
Let's see if you know what I'm talking about, Arisato...      
What's the name of the stratospheric layer of molecules comprised of three oxygen atoms?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
The ozone layer.      
The ionosphere.      
The homosphere.      
      
Ms. Ounishi      
Wow, good job! I'm sure you'll do fine on the exam.      
      
Ms. Ounishi      
Wrong! The answer is "the ozone layer."      
      
Ms. Ounishi      
The oxygen molecule is vital to humanity in general, but the ozone allotrope in particular is necessary for life on earth.      
You are aware that the ozone layer absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation, right?      
Sadly, due to the destruction of our climate, there's less and less ozone protecting us...      
I probably have nothing to worry about, but you kids might.      
We need to be more environmentally friendly for the sake of all life on this planet.

Mr. Edogawa      
All right everyone, **finals are almost here**.      
Let's begin. "Tohokamiemitame"...      
Today, I'll finally talk about our own country's magic.      
While you may think you know enough about it already, you probably don't know the half of it.      
The belief that magic is a questionable subject is becoming more common...      
But what is swept into the corners of society today was once central to it.      
It could even be said that Japan came to be in the first place thanks to magic.      
After all, Himiko of Yama-taikoku was a shaman.      
She reportedly relied upon a type of shamanism called "kido" when ruling her domain.      
Sadly, we have no way of knowing how her magic worked...      
The same is true for Prince Shotoku, who established a centralized government.      
He practiced Onmyodo, so he was also a shaman of sorts.      
With origins like these, magic was naturally woven into the very fabric of Japan.      
In the Heian period, for example...      
The Bureau of Onmyo was established so that onmyoji could expel evil spirits, give spiritual advice, and train new practitioners.      
You may be familiar with it from the legend of Abe no Seimei.      
Even in the age of the samurai, magicians had their part to play.      
There were many generals who studied divination alongside military tactics—they could be considered magicians.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Happy - Say, are you still listening? Don't become mesmerized, now! Eeeheehee...      
Happy - Here's a test to see if you were actually paying attention.      
Get it wrong and I'll make some of your lingo taboo. "Tohokamiemitame"...      
Now, who to pick this time...? I choose thee, Arisato!      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
What sorcery was Himiko said to have used?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
Onmyodo.      
Kido.      
Jugondo.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Very good. Thank your kotodama powers for that one.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Wrong! From now on, "'Sup?" is a taboo greeting.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
The ease of access to magic that Japanese citizens had continued up to the Edo period...      
But the new government formed during the Meiji Reformation stamped it out.      
Tsuchimikado Shinto, which had only recently been revived, faded away once more...

Mr. Edogawa      
It's chilly today... "Atah gibor le-olam, Adonai"...      
Ms. Ounishi left early today, so I'll be filling in for her.      
I think today we'll learn about near-death experiences.      
There's no real reason for it—they've just been on my mind lately.      
Now, a near-death experience is defined as something an individual undergoes just before death.      
Is it true insight into the afterlife, or simply a trick of the brain?      
Opinions vary, but it is certainly true that near-death experiences have been a hotly-debated topic for some time.      
There are actually a few surviving records of ancient near-death experiences.      
According to the writings of Plato, a resuscitated soldier experienced the afterlife as a spirit.      
A similar incident was reported in Japan by ethnologist Kunio Yanagita in the Tono Monogatari.      
Psychologist Carl Jung wrote that, in his own near-death experience, he saw a vision of the world from afar.      
I'm sure you've heard your own stories, whether by famous or ordinary individuals.      
I have a few firsthand reports with me today. Let me read you some of them.      
"I felt as if my soul was detached from my body." "I met a friend who had already passed away."      
"I saw my whole life flashing before my eyes..."      
Happy - "I saw the most brilliant light." "I was bathed in pure light."      
"My body was brimming with happiness." This feeling of pure joy is also known as euphoria.      
At any rate, these kinds of reports are typical for the experience.      
Some people have actually attempted to make direct recordings of near-death experiences.      
Researcher Kenneth Ring has tried to quantify near-death experiences with a Weighted Core Experience Index.      
Modern efforts have led to a new theory of near-death experiences, which goes like so...      
If an individual is dying, yet denies that fact...      
They'll eventually come to realize that death is a reality they must accept, and become upset.      
As a result, they'll try to do anything they can to extend their life.      
But the futility of this leads to depression.      
In the end, they accept their fate.      
Although we may initially deny death, we'll accept it in the end. That's just how we humans are.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Happy - ...Is everyone listening? It's not every day that you hear a lesson like this! Eeeheehee...      
How about a test to see if you were paying attention?      
Get it wrong and your memories of life at school will disappear! "Atah gibor le-olam, Adonai"...      
Now, who should I pick? I choose thee... Arisato!      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
What do we call the feeling of joy that comes from a near-death experience?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
Euphoria.      
Utopia.      
Yugoslavia.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Good work... That is correct. You'll have a happy school life.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Wrong. You won't be seeing yourself in the yearbook...      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Some people say a near-death experience awakens one's higher consciousness.      
Whether or not that's true, there is an observably lower fear of death found in those who have endured one.      
Perhaps this is because near-death experiences are surprisingly free of pain and suffering.      
But this is not to say I'd want any of you to seek one out. Use the time you have here wisely, okay?      
Well, that's all for today. Class is dismissed.

Ms. Toriumi      
Happy new year, everyone. Winter break has come and gone.      
No more boozing— Oh, you guys are underage. Wow, I feel sorry for you...      
      
Ms. Toriumi      
But since it's a new year, here's a relevant question for you all.      
      
Ms. Toriumi      
Let's see... Arisato-kun!      
Do you know about the monk named Ikkyu? He's the one who's famous enough that they made a show based on his life.      
Well, this is what he said about New Year's...      
"The new year is the index of a journey to a certain place." Where is this "certain place" he's referring to?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
One's hometown.      
One's second life.      
The underworld.      
      
Ms. Toriumi      
Yes, that's right!      
"Our New Year's decorations are but milestone markers along the path to the underworld."      
      
Ms. Toriumi      
Womp-womp! The correct answer is "the underworld."      
"Our New Year's decorations are but milestone markers along the path to the underworld."      
      
Ms. Toriumi      
Ikkyu was one eccentric old man.      
During the new year celebration, he carried around a staff with a skull on top of it...      
And he'd say stuff like, "Death is coming closer," to random passersby and whatnot...      
Anyway, if you want to learn more about old-timey stuff like this, you can go ask Ekoda— I mean, Mr. Ekoda about it.      
Now, please open your textbooks.      
      
---      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Let's get started, shall we? "Xilka, Xilka, Besa, Besa"...      
There's been an awful lot going on in the world lately...      
But you shouldn't let it get to you.      
Many people are overly susceptible to the effects of the occult.      
The worst thing a magician can do is lose control.      
Always do what must be done, and you'll be fine.      
Anyway, today's lecture is on the magic of ancient Greece.      
Greece is known as the birthplace of Western philosophy and rationality, but...      
The art of the curse advanced right alongside these lofty notions.      
While Greece was home to the great philosophers like Socrates, Thales, and Plato...      
It was also the home to legendary enchantresses.      
For example, there was Medea, the passionate sorceress of Colchis.      
She was a witch who didn't hesitate to kill her brother or even her own children.      
Then there was Circe, daughter of Helios, who was an expert in both poison and medicine.      
Without Hermes's help, the legendary Odysseus would have been turned into a pig by Circe.      
These may have only been myths, but by reading between the lines, you can see ancient Greece's views on magic.      
Greek magic began to take shape around the 8th century BC.      
It was around the same time that the "poleis," or city-states, were developing.      
Like many ancient civilizations, they worshiped gods for protection.      
There were temples that priestesses tended—these women would double as oracles.      
Gradually, however, these ceremonies were performed in secret rather than in public.      
The reason for this was the people's desire to monopolize the power of the gods.      
They copied the barbaric practices of legend: sacrifices, drinking, orgiastic festivals...      
Dangerous acts such as these became widespread.      
Apollo, Dionysus, Orpheus...      
These were the gods they invoked when performing the rituals.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Happy - Are you all paying attention? Don't cross the River Styx, now! Eeeheehee...      
Happy - How about I toss out a question for you?      
Get it wrong and your aura will shift! "Xilka, Xilka, Besa, Besa"...      
Now, who to pick...? I choose thee, Arisato!      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
I've mentioned two Greek sorceresses. One was Medea. Who was the other?      
      
Minato Arisato - Selection      
Poleis.      
Circe.      
Hecate.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Very good! Your aura is as clear as a mountain spring.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Wrong! Your aura is now muddy and slightly smelly.      
      
Mr. Edogawa      
Anyway, back to the lecture. It was that secrecy which turned priestesses into sorceresses.      
Teachings originally meant to bring salvation to the body and soul fell into mere debauchery...      
Which lured people down the hideous path of immoral practices.      
Necrophilia, using babies as potion or spell ingredients...      
This was the birth of the abominable "dark arts"...

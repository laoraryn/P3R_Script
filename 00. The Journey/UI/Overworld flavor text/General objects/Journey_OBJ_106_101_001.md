Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I spend the day   
praying at the shrine...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It doesn't seem like I'll receive   
any further blessings...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
お賽銭を入れようか…   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Right now, the Temperance Arcana   
may help me grow even more...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I put money into the box.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
......   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I don't have enough money...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Wait, I've already prayed   
at the shrine today...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It's getting late... I should   
head back to the dorm.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
After making an offering and   
praying, it feels like I've been   
blessed with greater intelligence...!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I offer 100 yen...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I offer 1,000 yen...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Should I offer 10,000 yen...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yes   
No   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
......   
So far, there's no sign of my prayer being   
answered. Maybe I'll try again later...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The air around me has shifted...   
...!   
There's an unfamiliar scrap   
of paper in my pocket...   
Upon closer inspection... it looks   
like an old bill. It says, "500 yen"...!   
It looks like my prayers were answered.   
I should let Elizabeth know...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Come to think of it, Elizabeth   
asked me to find a 500-yen bill   
by visiting the shrine 100 times...   
Well... Maybe I should pray before I go...

It's a vending machine.

Come to think of it, Elizabeth asked   
me to get a variety of drinks for her...   
I think I have everything now. I should   
bring them to her before I forget...

This might be the vending machine that   
was trending on the online forum...   
Apparently, you can still buy the   
drinks that it says are sold out...   
There are **three types of drinks** that   
are currently listed as "sold out"...   
Maybe I'll try buying something   
even if it says it's sold out...

You can now buy more drinks at the vending machine in front of Iwatodai Station.

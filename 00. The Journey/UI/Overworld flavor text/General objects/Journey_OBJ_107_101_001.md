You're leaving already?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah.   
Not yet.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Whaaat? That's lame. Well, I'm gonna stay a little longer.   
See you later, then.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Now that's what I like to hear!   
Happy - This is the beach we're talkin' about here... You know what that means? Cute girls in bikinis!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Dude, don't be a stick in the mud...   
Come on, the party's just gettin' started!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Alrighty then, time to get going?   
...Yeah, as if! C'mon, hurry up and go after her already!

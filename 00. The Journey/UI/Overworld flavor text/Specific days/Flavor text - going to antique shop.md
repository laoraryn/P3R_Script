Chagall Café serves Pheromone   
Coffee, their signature drink.   
Apparently, drinking it makes you   
more charming. But right now,   
I need to find the antique shop.

It's the police station's bulletin board...   
There are posters regarding traffic safety   
and reminders of recent crimes in the area.   
I should get back to looking for the antique   
shop before I get too caught up reading.

Frivolous Student   
Hmm... Oh, there it is. Class F, huh.   
Homeroom teacher is... What!? Ms. Toriumi!?   
...I guess she is older than me, but...   
Exasperated* - I was hoping to be with Ms. Kanou...

Distressed Student   
Huh? The library...?   
That's strange. I even made sure to check the map, but...   
Sad - Where am I...?

Upset Girl   
Angry - Wha— Kaz, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a jersey!?   
   
Boy Wearing a Jersey   
What do you mean "why"? We've got practice after class, remember?   
   
Upset Girl   
Angry - But we've got to attend the opening ceremony and go to class before all that!   
Angry - Hurry and head into your classroom so you can change into your normal uniform!   
   
Boy Wearing a Jersey   
Sad - What? But I just... Okay, okay, fine. Just quit glaring at me.   
So where's the bulletin board with all the class assignments?   
   
Upset Girl   
Angry - It's literally right there, Kaz! You're in Class F.   
Angry - I'm in a different homeroom, so I can't keep an eye on you all the time... You got that!?   
   
Upset Girl   
Angry - ...I worry about you sometimes.   
   
Boy Wearing a Jersey   
Who are you, my mom?

Faculty Member   
Hmph. Kids these days don't know how to show respect for their elders.   
We're their teachers. We've lived longer than them.   
But Moriyama and her friends had to pull that on me at the very beginning of the term...   
   
School Store Vendor   
...I'm sorry to interrupt, but I need to get back to managing the shop.   
   
Faculty Member   
Even YOU'RE shooing me away? Some way to start the school year...   
I don't think my nerves can take this.   
   
School Store Vendor   
All right, all right.   
You want me to order more of those cream-filled breads you like so much, right?   
You could have just asked...

Man Wearing a Helm   
Now, listen closely. A true man should always carry the fiery soul of a samurai within them!   
Our school curriculum nurtures the samurai spirit within our students so that they contribute to society...!   
   
Foreign Exchange Student   
Happy - Oh là là! How wonderful! I wish to set my soul on fire and learn the ways of the great samurai also!   
   
Man Wearing a Helm   
That's what I like to hear, my boy! Though you hail from a foreign land, the samurai spirit burns within you all the same!

Yes... And in that very moment, Lord Masamune's eye was, without a doubt, brimming with tears.

A fascinating story! It brings eyes to my tears!   
   
Man Wearing a Helm   
Yes, yes, yes! It does indeed!

Oh, great... I have the worst teacher ever...

Student   
Huh? The faculty office? Um... I think it's that way.   
Actually, I'm new here, so you should probably ask someone else.

Student   
Whaaaaaat? I don't see my name...   
What should I do...? What should I do!?   
   
---   
   
Student   
There's no need for them to post the names of the kids who are gonna be in our class.   
I mean, we'll never see them again after we graduate anyways.

My name is... added on a small   
note off to the side.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
"Class 2-F: Minato Arisato"   
...Hm? The name "Yukari   
Takeba" is also on the list.   
It seems that I'll be in   
the same class as her...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It looks like I'm in Class 2-F.

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0   
This seems to be the faculty   
office. Should I go in...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Enter   
Don't enter   
   
---   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This appears to be the library. I wonder   
if I can study here on my own...   
In any case, I should head to the faculty   
office for now. It should be near here.   
   
---   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This seems to be the nurse's office. Maybe I   
should come another time when I'm tired...   
In any case, I should head to   
the faculty office for now.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This appears to be the science lab. I wonder   
what kind of experiments we'll be doing...   
In any case, I should head to   
the faculty office for now.   
   
---   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This appears to be the welfare practice room.   
I wonder what kind of class is held here...   
In any case, I should hurry   
to the faculty office.   
   
---   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This is the printing room. I wonder if the   
teachers' handouts are printed here...   
In any case, I should head to   
the faculty office for now.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I wonder if the home economics prep room   
has sewing supplies and other tools...   
In any case, I should head to   
the faculty office for now.   
   
---   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
This is the music prep room. There are   
probably instruments stored here...   
In any case, I should go to the faculty office.

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0   
I wonder if the practice field   
and gym are up ahead...   
In any case, the faculty office should   
be in the opposite direction of here...   
   
---   
   
DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0   
Up ahead is the school's main gate.   
I could leave the school through here...   
But for now, I should go to the faculty office.

DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0   
These are the stairs to the second floor.   
There must be more classrooms upstairs...   
But the faculty office should   
be here on the first floor...

Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Could this be the art room? The faint smell   
of paint is coming from inside...   
In any case, I should go to the faculty office.   
   
---   
   
DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0   
I can smell the pungent odor of chemicals   
wafting from the science room...   
In any case, I should head to   
the faculty office for now.   
   
---   
   
DEV: Internal MES - MND_000_0_0   
Since the school is so upscale, the music   
room's soundproofing must be amazing...   
In any case, I should head to   
the faculty office for now.   
   
---   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I wonder if there are sewing and cooking   
lessons in the home economics classes...   
In any case, I should go to the faculty office.

Mitsuru Kirijo   
Oh, it's you. Be careful on your way back.   
I'll be heading to the dorm soon as well. Don't stay out too late.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Have you memorized the route to and from school?   
I recommend visiting the strip mall on your way back while it's still light out.

Elderly Man   
Oh, are you a student from a school around here?   
Well, you'll be glad to know you can get some quality sushi close by! I make it right here!   
Happy - Drop by sometime if you want! ...Oh, actually, our shop is still under renovation. Sorry.   
   
Elderly Woman   
...We are a bookstore, not a sushi restaurant.   
I'm sorry. He's always like that.

Yukari Takeba   
Oh, you're leaving now? You know how to get back, right?   
Exasperated* - Junpei... Don't go teaching Arisato-kun any weird stuff, all right?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Catch ya later, Yuka-tan.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Well, I gotta head to archery practice now. Since new students are joining, it's gonna get busy.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Huh? You're back?   
It's against dorm rules to be out at night, so make sure you don't stay out too late.

Man, I'm stuffed after that meal... Maybe I'll run a couple laps.   
I wonder if someone new will compete this year, like a rival to get me fired up.

Chubby Student   
Hm? Who are you? By the looks of it, we go to the same school...   
Sorry, but I'm busy trying to decide what to eat here.   
Should I go with the pork ramen and chase it with rice? Or perhaps a large Hagakure Bowl?

Stern-Looking Student   
Just because it's a new school year doesn't mean that students should be running wild.   
It's up to me to reinforce order. That is, once I've officially become a member of the disciplinary committee.   
   
Kind-Looking Upperclassman   
You're making such a sour face again, Odagiri-kun... I guess some things never change.   
   
Kind-Looking Upperclassman   
Happy - Aren't you excited? The spring season always feels like the beginning of something new.   
   
Stern-Looking Student   
Keisuke... You haven't changed either.

Come to think of it, the crops I planted on the

Maybe I should go check on them...

There's a crowd forming in

going to the faculty office...

Class has ended for today.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
......   
...My whole body feels sluggish. I'm   
too exhausted to fight the fatigue.   
The third-years' graduation   
ceremony is tomorrow.   
I should head to bed early tonight.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Should we also take a look around the school, while we're at it?   
I'll just follow you around. If you want to leave, head for the front entrance.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Today's lessons have ended...   
There are plans for a celebration   
to be held tonight...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, I was just headed there myself.   
You know the place, right? Let's go.

I've finished today's exams.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I should head back to the dorm.

Today marks the end of the first term.

There will be a full moon tonight. It is   
the day I was forewarned about...   
I wonder if something will happen...   
I should probably head back   
to the dorm, just in case.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
There will be a full moon tonight.   
A powerful Shadow may appear.   
I should return to the   
dorm and prepare myself.

Mitsuru has left the classroom...   
It seems I can join the student council if I   
submit some paperwork at the faculty office.   
I should head to the faculty office   
when I have some free time.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The library is open for students to study in.   
It might be worth taking advantage   
of it ahead of next week's exams.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Apparently, the teacher in the nurse's   
office gives out strange medicine.   
Maybe I should check it out sometime...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It seems that something important   
will be happening at the dorm...   
I should head back early.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
That's right, I received a message from   
Sanada earlier asking to meet after school.   
I should go meet up with him.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I should go to Tatsumi Memorial   
Hospital for my checkup.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The clouds look ominous...   
I should head back to the dorm.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Apparently, the track team is   
recruiting new members.   
If I can find where they practice, maybe   
I could see about possibly joining the team.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Apparently, the bookstore at   
the strip mall is reopening today.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Apparently, there is a lonely   
little girl at the shrine...   
Maybe I should check up on   
her to see if she's okay...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Apparently, the art club   
is recruiting new members.   
I might be able to learn more about   
them if I visit their club room.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Oh yeah, I got a message from Ryoji.   
It looked like he wasn't at school today.   
Maybe something urgent came up...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Come to think of it, Elizabeth mentioned she   
had something important to discuss with me.   
I should head to the Velvet Room.

Now an update on the recent disappearances. We can confirm that at least one of those located were found to have Apathy Syndrome.

Oh, Arisato. Were you able to get some rest after last night?   
I apologize for the trouble, but I'm counting on you. And don't worry, Akihiko will be rejoining the front lines soon enough as well.   
That aside, don't forget that exams are coming up, so why don't you take today to relax a little?

Hey, let's go to Tartarus. Start the new year off strong, y'know?   
I mean, if we just take it easy, that'll just make me more nervous at this point.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, wanna hit up Tartarus later?   
Happy - C'mon, we're two days into the new year already! We can't just sit around all year!   
Happy - Anyway, kidding aside, let's start the new year off strong, huh?   
   
Junpei Iori   
I kinda feel like just sittin' around, tryin' to relax, isn't very relaxing anymore, y'know?   
Happy - But it feels like we started off the new year strong. Maybe a sign of what's to come?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I've been seeing a lot of graffiti and creepy posters around lately...   
And a lot of people have been acting weirdly, too. I wonder if it's somehow related to Nyx...

Mitsuru Kirijo   
Arisato, why don't we go to Tartarus tonight?   
Unlike the end of last year, we now have a clear goal—to reach the top of Tartarus.   
We must not falter before even approaching Nyx.   
We have to do all that we can.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Arisato, why don't we go to Tartarus again tonight?   
We have a duty to defeat Nyx.   
For this particular mission, I don't believe the concept of "overpreparing" applies.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The school somehow feels different from last year. It has a strange atmosphere, doesn't it?   
A lot of students in my class were talking about cults and other weird things...   
I imagine this has something to do with the coming of Nyx...   
...Well, let me know if you want to go to Tartarus.

And then, just like always... let's all come back here together.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We're almost halfway through January.   
Today is the 13th, so we only have eighteen more days.   
Sad - Um, Arisato-kun... Why don't we go to Tartarus today?   
Sad - I think it would be best to do all we can right now, even if we have to push ourselves a little.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We're almost halfway through January.   
Today is the 13th, so we only have eighteen more days.   
Sad - Um, Arisato-kun... Why don't we go to Tartarus today as well?

Fuuka Yamagishi   
We're almost halfway through January.   
Today is the 13th, so we only have eighteen more days.   
To be honest, I was still nervous until recently.   
Happy - But I'm not nervous anymore. I know that we'll be all right.   
   
Aigis   
Um... Why don't we go to Tartarus tonight?   
I feel like it has been a while since I was the one to suggest we go.   
Sad - After I was released from the lab following my repairs, I was so confused...   
But I'm not confused anymore.   
I want to be by your side... and fight together with you.   
   
Aigis   
Time seems to pass by so quickly lately. It's already the middle of January...   
Minato-san... I will no longer waver.   
I know what I want to do... And that is to fight alongside you.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Mitsuru-senpai and Sanada-senpai went to take their entrance exams today.   
Sad - And they're going again tomorrow, too. How do they concentrate with everything going on?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Why wouldn't I concentrate? I'm not about to give up.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - I suppose you could say we are defying fate.   
Happy - But I want to ensure that I'm doing everything that I can be doing.   
Happy - Which is to say that I won't give up either.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
By the way, if you're going to Tartarus, I'll go with you.   
Happy - The final battle's in a couple weeks. I'm not putting training on hold just 'cause of some exam.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Wow... I don't know if I can keep up, but... at the very least, I won't give up either.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Aigis

Hey, let's go to Tartarus tonight.   
Just ten more days after today. I wanna train some more, just in case, y'know?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'll think about it.   
Let's not overdo it.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Cool. I'm ready to go when you are!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - C'mon, man! Ya know what's better than being strong? Being too strong!   
Happy - I mean, anyone can be just normal strong. But we're heroes, so we gotta get too strong!   
   
Junpei Iori   
After today, it'll be just ten more days 'til the day Ryoji was talkin' about, huh...?   
Happy - Alright, I'm hyped! We're gonna blow that Nyx thing away!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Just one week left until the 31st.   
You probably already know this, but just in case...   
**Once we enter Tartarus on January 31st, we won't be able to leave until the battle's over.**   
Losing isn't an option, so spend your time this last week wisely.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Today might be our last Monday...   
Sad - If we don't win, there won't be another...   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Everything will be okay.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Aigis...?   
   
Aigis   
We are going to win.   
...We have to win.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Aigis...   
That's right. We can't afford to doubt ourselves, even a little bit. We will win, no matter what.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Only five more days until the Promised Day...   
Happy - But we're gonna break that "promise."   
Happy - Hey, you wanna go to Tartarus later? I'm starting to get a little antsy, so let's get moving!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Only five more days until the Promised Day...   
But we're gonna break that "promise."   
Sad - ...I'm trying to not overthink it too much, but it's kinda hard not to, ya know...?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Four more days... I can practically feel Nyx breathing down my neck at this point.   
Let me know whenever you want to go to Tartarus, even if it's every single night.   
We've come so far... Nothing's more important than this.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Four more days... I can practically feel Nyx breathing down my neck at this point.   
Let me know whenever you want to go to Tartarus. I want to push myself to my limits.   
We've come so far... Nothing's more important than this.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Four more days... I can practically feel Nyx breathing down my neck at this point.   
Prepare in every way possible so you don't regret anything. I'm doing my own preparations, too.   
We've come so far... Nothing's more important than this.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Only three more days, man. I'm kinda lookin' forward to it, but also... kinda not.   
Anyway, wanna go to Tartarus later? Gotta keep our sweet muscles toned, y'know?   
Happy - Well, whatever. I'll leave it up to you.   
Happy - After everything we've been through, I totally believe in you, dude.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Only three more days, man. I'm kinda lookin' forward to it, but also... kinda not.   
So, what're ya thinkin'? Should we head to Tartarus for some extra training?   
Happy - Well, whatever we do's up to you. I know you'll steer us in the right direction, like always.   
Happy - So it's up to you, Leader!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Only three more days, man. I'm kinda lookin' forward to it, but also... kinda not.   
Happy - Hey... I know I've given you some shit before, but I'm fully behind you now, dude.   
Happy - So let's give Nyx hell! Whaddaya say, Leader?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Just two days left now...   
It's cold and dreary outside, and I couldn't blame you for feeling even drearier at the moment.   
Happy - But we need to just hang on a little while longer. Spring is just around the corner, as they say.   
   
Aigis   
It's almost time.   
It has been ten years since Death awakened...   
And now, finally, tomorrow is the Promised Day.   
**Once we enter Tartarus tomorrow, we won't be able to leave.**   
...Are you ready?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, hey. Welcome back.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey... Welcome back...   
   
Junpei Iori   
'Sup, dude?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, man...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Welcome back.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Welcome back...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Oh, you're back.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hi, how was your day?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh... Hello...

Hello there. Welcome back.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, there you are!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, you're here? Sorry, guess I missed you...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yooo, what's up?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, hey...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hm? Oh, it's you.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hm...? Oh, I see you're here...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Were you in your room all this time?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, hello! I didn't realize you were already here.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, you're here? Hello...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, Arisato-kun...!   
   
Aigis   
Good evening.   
   
Aigis   
Good evening.   
   
Aigis   
Did you have a good day?   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Ken Amada   
Get any studying done?   
   
Ken Amada   
You were here? Well... Hello.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...'Sup?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Oh, I didn't know you were already here. As you can see, I've come over for a quick visit.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Come to think of it, the crops I planted on the   
rooftop should be ready to harvest by now...   
Maybe I should go check on them...

Mitsuru Kirijo   
Ah, welcome back.   
How was your first day at school?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Not too bad.   
Tiring.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - I see. Well, don't hesitate to ask your classmates for help if you need it.   
Oh, apologies. I didn't mean to keep you here. You've had a long day, so get some rest.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - It may be overwhelming at the beginning, but you'll get used to everything in due time.   
But for now, you should go back to your room and rest.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You're pretty late. I don't mean to be overbearing, but please don't make this a regular occurrence.   
Well, in any case, you look quite tired. Why don't you go to bed early tonight?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Oh, welcome back! I gotta say, I'm so relieved now that you're out of the hospital.   
Don't push yourself, though. Do you want to get some rest? Don't worry, your room's safe now.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
By the way, regarding the Dark Hour...   
This may go without saying, but it is impossible to do business at any stores during that time.   
So make sure you're ready in advance. You don't want to be caught unprepared when it's too late.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh yeah, so you're buddies with Tomochika now?   
Happy - He was sayin' you're "someone to watch out for." Oh, but in a good way.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Hell yeah, I am.   
You're friends with him too?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Haha! I can see why you two get along.   
Happy - He's kind of a ladies' man, but he's a good dude.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I mean, we're not super close or anything, but we've known each other for a while.   
Happy - He's kind of a ladies' man, but he's a good dude.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, I almost forgot, I was gonna ask if you wanna go to Tartarus tonight.   
Happy - It looks like there's more of those "Lost," so we gotta take out more Shadows, right?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Hey, by the way, I saw you at the practice field earlier.   
Happy - Miyamoto-kun from our class is also on the track team, right? Maybe you guys will be friends.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, just FYI, if any clubs seem interesting, be sure to join before they stop taking new members.   
I know joining something new can be tough, but it'll be fun, and you might make new friends!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, speaking of extracurriculars... Is it okay if we go to Tartarus tonight?   
I didn't have practice today, so I thought it might be good to get a little exercise.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm glad that you're taking initiative, but don't take it lightly. Remember, it's dangerous there.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Yeah, I know.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, speaking of extracurriculars... Do you wanna go to Tartarus tonight?   
I didn't have practice today, so I thought it might be good to get a little exercise.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm glad that you're taking initiative, but don't take it too casually and let your guard down.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Yeah, I know...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I've actually been thinking about getting involved in more things besides just archery, too.   
Oh, wait, I guess I'm already doing that, huh? Not exactly what I meant, though...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Are you getting enough training in? I don't want the team going downhill while I recover.   
You're the only ones who can fight right now, after all.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It seems like you've been doing a good job exploring Tartarus, but...   
I'd still recommend trying to get even stronger, while you can.   
You never know when another big one might show up, like before.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It seems like you've been doing a good job exploring Tartarus.   
Just remember, you're the only ones who'd be able to do anything if something happened.   
Happy - Until I finish recovering, I'll be counting on you.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, right, I heard you might be joining the student council?   
Kirijo-senpai, you sure you wanna let a slacker like this guy join?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm not forcing him. But if you're concerned about his work ethic, would you rather join yourself?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Oh, uhhhh... I'll pass. But thanks for the offer.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh yeah, you can use that computer over there whenever you want, by the way.   
You can put whatever software you want onto it, too!   
Oh, but don't play online games on it. It'd suck if someone else accidentally used your account.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Arisato, I need to talk to you.   
It's been ten days since you first entered Tartarus, yet you haven't returned a single time since.   
What exactly are you thinking?   
I told you it would be dangerous if you don't train adequately.   
Perhaps it was a mistake making you the leader... I hope you don't continue to disappoint me.   
We'll be going to Tartarus today, whether you like it or not. Got it?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Got it.   
Give me a minute...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - I don't want to hear any excuses. You should have had plenty of time to prepare by now.   
Angry - I let you operate at your own convenience before, but clearly that was a mistake.   
Now, we'll be doing what's best for everyone, not just you. So go get ready.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
There is no one in the lounge...   
Everyone is probably already   
waiting on the fourth floor.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, hey. Welcome back.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey... Welcome back...

Mitsuru Kirijo   
A long weekend is coming up, so I suggest we use this time to go to Tartarus.   
It will take time for Akihiko to heal, and I don't want to repeat what happened last month.   
Sad - Plus, the number of victims seems to have been increasing. And... I've had this unsettling feeling...   
So, for all these reasons, we had best muster as much strength as we can.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We've got a long weekend coming up, don't we?   
Akihiko's going to need some more time to recover. I hope nothing happens in the meantime.   
Sad - The number of victims seems to be increasing, and I can't help but feel this is just the beginning of something bigger...   
We'd best muster our strength while we can.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Oh, regarding Akihiko's recovery... It seems he'll still need some more time.   
...Well, there's no need to rush things. You've all been working hard. Use the long weekend to rest.   
That said, there's been an uptick in the number of incidents lately, so don't be careless.   
Sad - ...I can't seem to shake this bad feeling I have... Perhaps it is just unnecessary concern on my part.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Finally, the three-day weekend starts tomorrow!   
Sad - I asked some peeps if they wanted to hang out, but the only ones interested were guys...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You had best use your time wisely. Need I remind you that midterms are quickly approaching?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - And here I was, thinking I could just live in blissful ignorance for a few days... *sigh*   
   
Junpei Iori   
So, I heard this from a friend...   
Word is, there's a guy at Escapade sellin' URLs for... unusual sites.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Selling URLs?   
Go buy one for me.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yup. Prolly not the kinda sites your average joe could just stumble upon himself, y'know?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Wha—!? Oho, so that's how you wanna play? Ha, no can do, man.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - It does sound pretty interesting, but a glitzy club like that, prolly got security up the wazoo? Nope!   
Sad - Students ain't allowed in places like that. You'd need some serious **Courage** to go in anyway.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Arisato-kun, let's go to Tartarus tonight.   
Sad - Nothing's really happened since that one day, and I'm starting to get kinda anxious...   
Sad - And more people have been getting Apathy Syndrome lately, right? I'm not imagining things?   
Sad - I just have this feeling that something bad is going to happen... Maybe I'm just being paranoid, ha...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Have more people been getting Apathy Syndrome lately, or am I just imagining things?   
Sad - ...Hey, why don't we go to Tartarus later?   
Sad - We should probably try to get as strong as possible, just to be safe.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Have more people been getting Apathy Syndrome lately, or am I just imagining things?   
For some reason, I feel like something bad is going to happen... But maybe I'm just being paranoid.   
Happy - I mean, it's not like anything's really happened since that one day, so we should be fine, right?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, have you seen how many of those freaks there are in town lately?   
...Man, things've gotta be pretty boring around here if that's the kinda thing that sticks out.   
Happy - How 'bout we go to Tartarus? That's one way to kill some time!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Maybe I should come along... I'm dying of boredom, too.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Akihiko, are you trying to make me angry?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, have you seen how many of those freaks there are in town lately?   
...Man, things've gotta be pretty boring around here if that's the kinda thing that sticks out.   
Sad - How 'bout we go to Tartarus? Oh, wait, we hit that dead end... So we really can't go any further?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Beats me. The layout of the place supposedly changes every day, so who knows?   
Happy - Hm... Maybe I should go check with you guys, just in case.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Akihiko, are you trying to make me angry?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...It's odd, really, how quiet it's been.   
It's been a month, but I can hardly believe that will be the last time they appear outside Tartarus.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I agree.   
There's been a sharp rise in the Lost recently. I wouldn't be surprised if something happened.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The mysterious boy I saw during the Dark   
Hour warned of an ordeal in one week.   
Tomorrow will mark exactly one week   
since then. I should prepare myself today...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
What could this urgent matter be about?   
I better head to the Velvet Room.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It seems some of the equipment in the command room is malfunctioning.   
Could you go and check on it? It shouldn't take long.   
I asked Akihiko and Iori as well, but they didn't appear particularly intent on solving the matter.   
It doesn't seem to be especially urgent, so whenever you have the time. Thanks.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I was just about to go borrow my friend's notes.   
I really need to study more for the midterms...   
So I can't go to Tartarus today. Sorry.   
   
Junpei Iori   
*sigh* I'm so tired of studying... Hey, let's go to Tartarus.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'll think about it.   
You should keep studying.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Sweet! I knew I could count on you, man!   
Happy - You're comin' too, right, Yuka-tan?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Dude, you serious!?   
Isn't saving the world more important? Yuka-tan, you wanna go too, right?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - You know exams are just a few days away, right?   
Sad - But I guess I could use a break from studying... All right, I'll come too, if you decide to go.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, let's go to Tartarus.   
You can study anytime. We need to get stronger ASAP.   
Happy - You don't want me leavin' you in the dust, right? I'll take down the next big Shadow myself!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You seem confident.   
Go hit the books.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Damn right! Why shouldn't I be?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - C'mon, gimme a break, man...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Well, Iori, you must be quite confident in your grades to be so insistent on not studying.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, uh, well... Maybe I could study just a little more...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, let's go to Tartarus.   
You can study anytime. We need to get stronger ASAP.   
Happy - Hermes here is itchin' to go ham!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Man, I really don't wanna study, but it's not like there's anything else to do...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I know how you feel.   
Then study.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Right? I'd rather do pretty much anything other than study...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - C'mon, man, not you too...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You must be quite confident in your grades, Iori. I'm looking forward to your exam results.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Pleeease, Yuka-tan! You're the only one who can save me! This is the last time, I swear!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Why am I the only one? *sigh* Fine, just stop whining. So where did you stop taking notes?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, uh, probably like... the beginning...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm sure you're aware, but **midterms** start tomorrow.   
Since you've given so much time to exploring Tartarus, the least I can do is assist you with your studies.   
On that note, I've arranged a study group for today.   
I've already invited the others in the dorm, so if you can spare the time, I'd like you to attend.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hey, if you're up for it, let's go to Tartarus later.   
I need to get back into the swing of things.   
Besides, I can't leave all the fun to you guys.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hey, if you're up for it, let's go to Tartarus later.   
I need to get back into the swing of things. It'd probably do you some good to train more, too.   
We can't just rely on some hypothetical new recruit. The enemy could attack again anytime...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I know there's been talk of a new recruit, but don't expect too much from her right away.   
If there's another big fight soon, we shouldn't throw her in headfirst, if she even joins us at all.   
Happy - But that's where I come in. I've got a lot of missed fights to make up for, after all.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's strange...   
The number of Apathy Syndrome victims seems to be on the rise again...   
Evidently, the prior decline was only temporary.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - If that's the case, then what's the point of fighting...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If we do nothing, then everyone will eventually join the Lost.   
Our efforts have prevented the crisis from escalating to that point.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Yeah... I guess you're right.   
Sad - I'd hate to see what the city would be like if we couldn't use our Personas...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Did you hear the rumor going around school?   
I mean, c'mon, a ghost story? You'd think they'd be old enough to know ghosts aren't real...   
Sad - ...Anyway, uh... I'm feeling kind of uneasy all of a sudden, so I think I'll go to bed early.   
Sad - Oh, so I won't be going to Tartarus today, then. Sorry.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, hey. Welcome back.

---ise or somethin', right?   
Plus, there are all those weird rumors goin' around school, so I feel antsy just doin' nothing.   
Happy - In times like these, we just gotta let off steam in Tartarus.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, wanna go to Tartarus later?   
Apathy Syndrome has been on the rise or somethin', right?   
There are all those weird rumors goin' around school, so I feel antsy just doin' nothing...   
Happy - So why don't we go beatin' up a crap ton of Shadows? Y'know, as a stress reliever?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, Apathy Syndrome has been on the rise or somethin', right?   
There are all those weird rumors goin' around school, so I feel antsy just doin' nothing...   
Happy - Heh, I hope we get to do another operation where we throw down with a big Shadow and WAPOW! Give it a good ass-whoopin', y'know?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Arisato, could you free up your day tomorrow for me?   
There's a lot to be done for Fuuka Yamagishi's case.   
So I'm going to require your assistance.   
If you have any urgent affairs, then I suggest you settle them by the end of today.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Kirijo-senpai and Sanada-senpai went to the hospital to pay Yamagishi-san a visit.   
Looking away - I wonder if she's all right...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Kirijo-senpai and Sanada-san are both visiting Yamagishi today, too. So that leaves us on standby at the dorm.   
Happy - I wonder if she'll come home soon... Fuuka-chan!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - She hasn't agreed to join though, right?   
Sad - I hope she's not being pressured by them or anything...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh yeah, I hear Fuuka's moving into one of the rooms on the third floor.   
Sad - But the girls put their foot down when I offered to help—said us guys aren't allowed...   
Happy - Anyways, looks like she'll be coming here pretty early tomorrow. Exciting stuff, huh?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Should we head to Tartarus later?   
We have some time before the next full moon, but the enemies are growing stronger, too.   
So I'd like to train with Polydeuces even more... How about it?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We've made some progress for the time being... But we still can't afford to drop our guard.   
Even though we have some time until the next full moon, the enemies are growing stronger, too.   
Let me know if you plan on going to Tartarus. After all, you always gotta push your limits when training.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sorry, dude, I'm running to the store real quick.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, did you hear? Something's up with the equipment in the command room.   
Junpei's looked at it, but it seems like it's been breaking down a lot recently, doesn't it?   
I honestly had no clue what I was looking at. Arisato-kun, could you check it out later?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
There are two weeks until the next full moon. Let's train and build up our strength while we can.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Oh, it's time for another boss fight!?   
Happy - Heh, wonder what we're gonna be up against this time. Not gonna lie, I'm gettin' kinda excited.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
......   
With both Akihiko and Iori around, serious conversations are starting to sound like a joke.   
Speaking of Akihiko, has he returned yet?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Guess not. Maybe he went for a quick bite somewhere?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'm heading out for a bit. I'll be back late.

---robably already know this, but the next full moon will be on Tuesday of next week.   
I'm sure some kind of Shadow will show up.   
Please be ready.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Tomorrow's the day.   
If we lose, the city gets overrun with the Lost, right?   
We gotta win this, no matter what...   
Happy - Yo, let's go to Tartarus tonight. We can beat some Shadows to a pulp to brush up our skills!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Tomorrow's the day.   
If we lose, the city gets overrun with the Lost, right?   
We gotta win this, no matter what...   
Happy - You down for hitting Tartarus later? I wanna pack on some muscle.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Tomorrow's the day.   
If we lose, the city gets overrun with the Lost, right?   
Happy - We gotta win this, no matter what. We're the peacekeepers of this here town! ...Just kidding.   
Happy - Well, we oughta get in gear. If you're goin' to Tartarus today, count me in!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, that's right, Arisato-kun.   
For tomorrow, I think I'll have you stand by at the dorm just in case...   
Happy - So if there are preparations you need to make, please take care of them today.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sorry, I need to talk to Fuuka...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
About what?   
Want to go to Tartarus?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - Oh, um, there's something I have to clear up.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - Um... I'm feelin' kinda tired today, so I'd rather not.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm sure you're burnt out coming right off an operation...   
You know, it might do you good to just rest today.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Feeling rested?   
There's plenty of time until the next full moon, and while I wish I could tell you to take it slow...   
Finals start next week, so I'd like you to care for your health and concentrate on your studies.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, are you free tonight?   
With exams coming up, I thought maybe we second-years could hold a study session...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Pass. I'm headin' to my room.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Huh? Wait— Junpei!   
Oh well, his loss. You, me, and Fuuka can still study together.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
That antique shop in Paulownia Mall...   
The chairman suggested I pay them a visit...   
I'll head over there now...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - *sigh* Man, I'm beat...   
Sad - It seemed to take forever to get back...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Yeah, it was a tiring trip.   
Happy - Please rest up so you're ready for the next operation.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
There are six more to fight, right?   
Just the last full moon Shadows and things will go back to normal. No more Apathy Syndrome incidents, just plain, old, everyday life...   
Angry - Let's do our best! After all, we're the only ones who can help.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - By the way, how'd you fare on your exams?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Not too shabby.   
Pretty badly...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - That's great news! I'm happy for you.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Oh...   
Happy - Well, it is still just the first semester... You'll be all right.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
That reminds me, Kirijo-senpai was top of her class again!   
I mean, where does she find the time? She's unreal.   
   
Aigis   
...In two weeks, the moon will be full again.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Dude, those freaks with Apathy Syndrome will be everywhere— Wait, I mean the Lost.   
Sad - I mean, I feel bad for the victims and all, but seriously, it's like there's no end to 'em!   
   
Aigis   
Technically speaking, there is an end to them: six Shadows remain.   
If we can eliminate them, the Dark Hour will vanish.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeah, that's true...   
So, what you're trying to say, Aigis, is that fighting is more important than studying, right?   
Scheming - I agree 100%!   
   
Ken Amada   
My name is Ken Amada. I'll be staying here for a while.   
I'll try not to be a bother, so please don't mind me.   
   
Ken Amada   
Come to think of it, have you heard about **Be Blue V**?   
It's this shop in Paulownia Mall, but there's a rumor you can talk to spirits there!   
Sad - Sounds a little sketchy, huh? I wonder what kind of shop it is...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, that's right, didn't you have training today? How'd it go?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It was no sweat.   
It wore me out.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, yeah? You're tougher than I thought.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, don't push yourself too hard, dude.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, if you think you can handle it, let's go to Tartarus tonight!   
It's a little less than two weeks 'til the full moon, so I kinda wanna hit the bullpen.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, if you think you can handle it, let's go to Tartarus tonight!   
Happy - It's a little less than two weeks 'til the full moon. Gotta get that conditioning in, right?   
   
Junpei Iori   
So, as long as you're off the injury list...   
We're coming up on just under two weeks 'til the full moon, so don't go getting hurt, yeah?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Apathy Syndrome is on the rise again...   
People seem to have calmed down a bit, despite the media, but there will be serious problems if we don't end this.   
We must defeat the last six Shadows, beginning with the one we anticipate on the next full moon.   
If the number of the Lost continues to increase, this city will fall into chaos.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Y-You're just exaggerating, right?   
...Then again, maybe not.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The others aren't back yet...   
Kirijo-senpai said they'd be here by midnight.   
...Maybe we shouldn't go to Tartarus today.   
   
Junpei Iori   
One more week 'til the moon is full again...   
You seen how things look at Paulownia Mall lately? The Lost are really on the rise...   
Happy - I feel like it's really on us to do something about this now. Let's wipe the floor with these Shadows!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Hey... Doesn't it seem like there's a lot more of the Lost than before?   
Sad - There were quite a few in the city today. They were making my friend really anxious...   
Sad - *sigh* When's the next full moon again, next week? We really have to bring our A game, don't we?   
   
Yukari Takeba

Akihiko Sanada   
I hear you'll be in that competition tomorrow. You better do your best to win.   
Although, there's this guy, "Hayase," who they say's supposed to crush the competition.   
--- famous, dude. I've seen him in sports magazines.   
What's even the point of tryin' to go up against guys like that? You'll just wear yourself out...   
---Mitsuru Kirijo   
I heard from Akihiko that you did well in the competition.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's no big deal.   
Too bad I didn't win.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Regardless, I'm impressed with your ability to balance so many aspects of your life successfully.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Yeah, Arisato-kun, that's amazing! You should give yourself some more credit.   
Happy - If nothing else, you're at least doing something, unlike someone else I know.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Yeah, yeah, sticks and bones can break my, uh... Whatever...   
Anyways, it's almost a full moon, right?   
That's "something" I can do! Uh, the mission, I mean.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah, the next full moon is August 6th. That's Thursday.   
It's likely that the enemy will be stronger than the last ones. Make sure you're ready.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There will be a full moon on Thursday.   
I'm sure some kind of Shadow will show up.   
It's coming up quickly, so please make sure you're fully prepared.   
   
Junpei Iori   
The day after tomorrow's the full moon, huh?   
Scheming - I'm already gettin' fired up! Let's kick some ass!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Well, tomorrow's the full moon...   
Are you ready, Arisato-kun?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yup.   
I'm kind of nervous...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Good! Me too!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Yeah, it's still always a little nerve-racking...   
But you're always dependable in these types of situations, so I'm not too worried.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Well, aside from being ready mentally, we have to get physically prepared, too.   
We'll be on standby in the dorms tomorrow, so let's get everything that we need tonight.   
Happy - All right, then! Let's do our best, like always!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I was just talking with everyone about Koromaru.   
He'll need to be taken on walks, but we won't be assigning that duty to anyone in particular.   
It would help if you could **take Koromaru out for a walk at night if it seems he wants to go for one**.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - At least summer school's over now, but... doesn't it feel like we kinda wasted our summer vacation?   
Sad - I'll have to make a bunch of plans to make up for it. I wonder if anything's going on soon...   
   
Aigis   
I am currently aware of a **summer festival** tomorrow and a **film festival** the following day.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Oh, that's right. Wait, Aigis, are you thinking about going to the festivals?   
   
Aigis   
Indeed. My data indicates that festivals and other events of the sort offer unique experiences.   
So, for investigative purposes, I plan to infiltrate such a "shindig."   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Uhhhh-huh... Well, try not to stand out too much.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
It's sooo hot... I hate this weather...   
How are you holding up, Arisato-kun?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Never better!   
I can't take it anymore...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Oh, really? Sounds like you're making the most of your summer vacation!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Yeah, this heat is the worst... I feel exhausted just sitting here...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Let me try to get my mind off the heat. So... the next full moon is in September, right after break...   
Sad - Ugh... When I talk about it like that, it sounds like I'm preparing for an exam or something...   
Sad - But anyway, there are only four Shadows left... We have to hang in there.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Summer break will be ending in just under two weeks.   
Of course, fighting Shadows takes priority, but don't forget to dedicate time to studying as well.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Damn, it's hot...   
Sad - I'm sweatin' like a pig over here, man...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Stay strong, Iori. The heat will only affect you if you allow it to.   
......   
Sad - ...Of course, there are limits to that theory.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Ugh...   
   
Aigis   
The next full moon will occur on September 5th.   
As such, we have approximately two weeks until our next mission.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Hey, Ai-chan, you wanna go on a "mission" to get some ice cream?   
   
Aigis   
...My records indicate that consumption of ice cream may lead to health risks detrimental to our ability to carry out operations.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Geez, way to ruin ice cream!   
   
Aigis   
I would like to ask you a question.   
Why do schools temporarily close during the summer?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Because it's hot.   
It's customary.   
   
Aigis   
I see.   
Then, after the allotted break period ends, school resumes.   
I comprehend.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Exasperated* - Hmm... If the pattern stays consistent, then cases of Apathy Syndrome will soon be on the rise.   
Exasperated* - It's a shame, since it's your summer vacation... But the Shadows don't take breaks.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Just one more week, and then summer vacation will be over...   
Happy - We've been so busy, but I don't think I've ever had a summer vacation that was so fulfilling before.   
Happy - Let's keep having fun these last few days, and try not to let the summer heat bother us too much.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - It really does get very hot in the dorm...   
Sad - Maybe it won't be so bad if we think of it like a sauna...?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's a pain dealing with this heat every day, but it's actually a good temperature for exercising.   
The sympathetic nervous system gets more active in heat, and muscular blood flow increases.   
It's perfect for training. So if you're going to Tartarus, I'll go with you.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's a pain dealing with this heat every day, but it's actually a good temperature for exercising.   
The sympathetic nervous system gets more active in heat, so the effects of training increase.   
These kinds of conditions are perfect for training in Tartarus. So how about it?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's a pain dealing with this heat every day, but it's actually a good temperature for exercising.   
Happy - I think I'll do some high-intensity training tonight.   
   
Aigis   
One week remains until the next full moon. Additionally, the Lost are increasing in number.   
I recommend continuing to assess the situation for any potential irregularities.   
   
Ken Amada   
It looks like there've been more of them lately... You call them "the Lost," right?   
I don't mean to be rash, but... I'd like to put my power to good use.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The moon will be full again soon...   
I'm sure this goes without saying by now, but please make sure you're adequately prepared.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
So ten days until summer vacation's over, huh? We were just as busy as normal this year...   
But Junpei seems to have as much free time as ever.   
   
Junpei Iori   
No, no, I'm enjoying my free time. It's what they call "adult composure."   
   
Yukari Takeba   
If you have such "composure," then hurry up and finish your homework...   
   
Junpei Iori   
*sigh* I'm bored outta my mind...   
Hey, what's the best way to actually "enjoy" free time?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Just sleep.   
Get to work.   
   
Junpei Iori   
There is that... But, at times like this, I'm not really tired.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Are you serious? I said "enjoy"!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, hey. Welcome back.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey... Welcome back...   
   
Junpei Iori

Oh, there you are!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, you're here? Sorry, guess I missed you...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yooo, what's up?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, hey...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hm? Oh, it's you.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hm...? Oh, I see you're here...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Were you in your room all this time?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, hello! I didn't realize you were already here.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, you're here? Hello...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, Arisato-kun...!   
   
Aigis   
Good evening.   
   
Aigis   
Good evening.   
   
Aigis   
Did you have a good day?   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Ken Amada   
Get any studying done?   
   
Ken Amada   
You were here? Well... Hello.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...'Sup?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Oh, I didn't know you were already here. As you can see, I've come over for a quick visit.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Come to think of it, the crops I planted on the   
rooftop should be ready to harvest by now...   
Maybe I should go check on them...

Shinjiro Aragaki   
...I haven't introduced myself, have I?   
Name's Shinjiro Aragaki. I stayed here before.   
...I won't bore you with all the details though.   
Anyway, long story short, I got your back.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
---re where or when it shows up—it's dead meat.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
...Kirijo-senpai and the others are at the hospital and won't be back until later today.   
Sad - From what I hear, that girl, Chidori, won't say anything...   
Sad - Maybe we should hold off on going to Tartarus until things are under control.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - So, um... you've probably already seen the message I sent, but I have a favor to ask you.   
Sad - It's about Amada-kun...   
Sad - This is just a hunch, but I think he's been feeling kinda down lately.   
Sad - Could you check in on him when you have the time? He should be in his room.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
By the way...   
How long have we been holding that Chidori girl?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I forget.   
About four days.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
I see...   
...Never mind, then.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
I see...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Iori may be permitted to watch over that girl for the time being.   
Now's not the time to bombard her with questions.   
Besides, we still have three Shadows to contend with.   
We should be able to accomplish that within the next few months, unless the situation changes.   
Don't let your guard down until the very end.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I heard that Chidori-san is starting to open up a little...   
But it seems that she's still uncomfortable talking about Personas...   
It might take some time before she's ready.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That's fine.   
We still have three Shadows to worry about, so let's focus on that.   
They'll be sorry they ever set foot into this world.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Is it just my imagination, or have the Lost been proliferating more quickly than usual lately?   
There are over two weeks until the next full moon, so why...?   
I suppose we should just focus on what we can accomplish right now. We'll deal with this next Shadow swiftly and effectively.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I feel a bit under the weather... Maybe   
I should head to bed early tonight.   
   
Ken Amada   
Oh, Arisato-san. Do you think we could head to Tartarus tonight?   
There have been even more cases recently, so... I just want to be ready for anything.   
Please let me know if you plan on going tonight, okay?   
   
Ken Amada   
Oh, Arisato-san. Any plans to go to Tartarus tonight?   
I want to get stronger... since there have been even more incidents and all.   
We can go whenever you're free. Just please take me with you if you're going to Tartarus.   
   
Ken Amada   
Have you noticed that there have been more cases lately? I wish there was something I could do about it...   
Sad - But there's nothing I can do, is there? At least, not at this time...   
Sad - It's frustrating...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - We'll be having another full moon soon...   
Happy - And since Chidori's getting better, I think I should start training again.   
Besides, those Apathy freaks are popping up everywhere.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Just one more week...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Arisato-kun, have you been able to figure out why the machine in the command room is malfunctioning?   
Kirijo-senpai asked me to take a look, but... I have no idea what's wrong with it...   
It seems to break down once a month around—   
   
Happy - Oh, don't worry, it doesn't affect our missions or anything.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
There's a good chance our next operation's gonna be on Sunday. We've got four days to prep, so don't slack, all right?   
By the way, I started a new workout routine last week specifically geared for combat.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Hey, he ain't the only one starvin' for a fight. Just say the word, you can count on me!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I appreciate the enthusiasm, but don't get yourself so worked up.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, hey. Welcome back.

Yukari Takeba   
Sad - The full moon's the day after tomorrow...   
Sad - There are only three Shadows left... We're almost done, so let's do our best, okay?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The full moon's almost here...   
We'll be on standby in the dorms tomorrow, like usual, so make sure everything's ready today.   
Happy - Well, good luck! I know everyone is going to do great!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Midterms will be starting next week...   
---l...   
Wait, I have to stop getting distracted. Exams are next week...   
Sad - *sigh* It's so hard to focus...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Monday's a holiday, so we have the next two days off.   
...There's just one Shadow left. I'm starting to get fired up.   
We've come this far, so we can't lose now. Let's train as much as we possibly can.   
Let's make him proud...   
   
Aigis   
The day after tomorrow, periodic examinations begin. How are your preparations progressing?   
Until recently, I had been reserving my energy for the final battle. However...   
According to Mitsuru-san, studying for exams is a crucial component in preparing for the future.   
Therefore, while I may be off to a late start, I will now initiate study mode.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Midterms start tomorrow, but...   
We can't simply ignore what happened. It's difficult to focus on studying at such a time...   
However, it would be unwise to ignore what's right in front of you as well, cold as it may sound.   
...I'll try to think of something to help everyone focus on the exams.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Phew, the five days from hell are finally over...   
Yo, you wanna head to ol' Tartar tonight?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure.   
I'll think about it.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Alright! I gotta get exams off the brain, y'know?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Phew, the five days from hell are finally over...   
It's been pretty rough lately, but at least now that's over with.   
I never wanna see another essay question again...   
   
Ken Amada   
Your exams are over, right?   
If you decide to go to Tartarus, I want to go too.   
Angry - I promise I'll do everything I can!   
Angry - I'll be fighting for him, too...!   
   
Junpei Iori   
There's been a lot more of the Lost lately, huh?   
But there's only one Shadow left. Once we destroy it, this whole thing'll be over.   
Let's do it, man.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yes, let's!   
Sure.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Yeah...   
Happy - Let's give everyone a reason to smile again... or something cool like that.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - The number of the Lost keeps increasing...   
Sad - It's like everywhere I go, there's a reminder that we still need to fight Shadows...   
But we just have to beat one more. Then we'll finally be done.   
   
Aigis   
It will soon be a full moon.   
In preparation of the final battle, I am ready to deploy to Tartarus at any time.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Aigis   
Koromaru-san appears to be both motivated and prepared as well.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Looking away - If you don't mind, there's something I'd like to ask of you.   
Looking away - It's about Aragaki-kun's room... I can't bear leaving it as it is.   
Looking away - Could I ask you to... organize his remaining belongings?   
He had no relatives to pass anything on to, and didn't have many possessions in the first place.   
His room will be cleaned out by staff next month, so if you could do what you can before **October 31st**...   
I'm sure it will be tough, but I would appreciate it. Thank you very much.   
   
Ken Amada   
The next full moon will be on November 3rd.   
Five more days...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Only three days left.   
Make sure you're fully prepared. I'm ready to train anytime.

Maybe I should go check on them...

Mitsuru Kirijo   
Only two days remain...   
It's been a long journey, but we're finally here.   
We're the only ones who can defeat it, so don't let your guard down until the very end.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Looks like Mitsuru won't be coming back for a while...   
Sad - I'd like to think that she'll be okay, but... I'm not so sure this time.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Whaddaya think about that Ryoji kid?   
Sad - He's goin' around askin' out every girl he sees!   
Sad - Damn... I wish I had his guts...   
---without saying a word...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
She'll be fine.   
Are you worried?   
   
Aigis   
I hope so...   
   
Aigis   
Worried...? No, not exactly.   
Sad - How should I say this? I feel... I feel responsible for what happened.   
   
Ken Amada   
Um... Is it just me, or does Junpei-san seem unhappy about something?   
He's been mumbling under his breath for the longest time... Do you think it's about Chidori-san?   
Well, it's probably best to let him be until we know what's on his mind, right?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I will join you at Tartarus tonight.   
...I apologize for worrying everyone.   
Our only priority now is to do something about Tartarus.   
Sad - I'll... be counting on you all again.   
Well, the school trip is next week, so that should be fun.   
But unfortunately, Amada and Koromaru will have to stay here.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Tomorrow's the school trip, dude!   
Happy - I'm so psyched!   
Happy - ...It kinda sucks that we're only going to Kyoto, though.   
   
Ken Amada   
Hm, Junpei-san seems to have his energy back.   
I guess there was no reason to worry about him.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh? What're ya talkin' about? I'm always energetic!   
By the way, you better behave while we're gone. Don't go throwin' any parties, got it?   
   
Ken Amada   
I won't.   
Oh, and please don't worry about bringing me back a souvenir.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - ...Hey, are ya tryin' to use reverse psychosis on me or somethin'?   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - No, of course not.   
Happy - It's just that Kyoto has a lot of great-tasting snacks.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I received a message...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I should talk to Junpei later...   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Wow, that was fast...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Aw, man... I'm so tired.   
Happy - ...But, it was a lotta fun.   
Happy - I brought you back some "souvenir stories," so I'll tell ya them later.   
   
Ken Amada   
Oh, okay.   
Sad - I'll be... looking forward to them.   
   
Junpei Iori   
We can't go to Tartarus tonight—we're all too tired.   
Let's go tomorrow night...   
Even though we don't have anything to fight for anymore...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Ryoji-kun was just here.   
He came to hang out with Junpei-kun.   
It's not often that we get visitors here.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Yeah... Do you think it's okay?   
Sad - I'm actually surprised that he's not with a girl.   
Hey, where's Aigis?   
   
Ken Amada   
I saw her on the second floor.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Really?   
Hmm, maybe she's with Koromaru... It's not like them to be gone.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - ...Junpei-san's still in his room.   
Sad - It's hard losing someone you're so close to...   
Sad - ......   
Sad - I hope he's okay...   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Junpei-san's still not feeling well...   
Sad - I'm getting really worried now...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - After all he's been through... I can understand why he's feeling down.   
Sad - He got really lucky this week, though...   
Sad - No one realized he took some days off because everyone was at Career Experience.   
Sad - Well, I hope he's feeling a little better now...   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - ...I'm going to defeat those Strega guys.   
Angry - I can't take this anymore!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - I know how you feel...   
Sad - But you don't have to do it all by yourself.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - ...I know.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
The full moon's almost here.   
No Shadows have appeared yet, but I'm still worried.   
Oh, that reminds me...   
Ryoji-kun's here again. He's visiting Junpei.   
Junpei's still pretty down...   
So I'm glad he has a good friend like Ryoji-kun.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, hey. Welcome back.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey... Welcome back...

===============================================================================================   
   
Junpei Iori   
Tomorrow's a full moon... Not like that means anything anymore, though.   
Man, there's nothing to do. I'm so bored...   
Maybe I'll go hang out with Ryoji.   
Happy - I didn't see him at school today, but he was prolly just ditchin', so he should be around.   
Surprised - Oh, wait... Crap, I don't know where he lives...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There will be a full moon tonight...   
But we won't be conducting an operation.   
I was thinking I might summon Juno and search around a little just in case, though.   
Oh, by the way, have you seen Aigis, Arisato-kun?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
---g home late recently...   
---i Iori   
......   
Oh, hey...   
Happy - So, like... what if everything yesterday was all just some crazy dream, y'know?   
......   
Looking away - Prolly not, though, huh...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looking away - ...Oh, Arisato.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looking away - Um... Do you suppose...   
Looking away - ......   
Looking away - No, never mind. There's no point in asking such things...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You're right.   
Are you scared?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looking away - Yes...   
Looking away - I'm sorry. Forget I said anything.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looking away - No, I don't think "scared" is the right word. I just can't seem to comprehend all that has happened.   
Looking away - I thought I had become stronger after dealing with what happened to my father, but...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - ......   
Hm...? Oh, it's you.   
Sorry, I was just thinking.   
...I was wondering, if I meet Shinji again someday, what he would say to me.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What would he say?   
Are you scared of death?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I bet he wouldn't say anything.   
He'd just punch me in the face before either of us has a chance to speak.   
He's got a strong right hook, so I'm sure it'd hurt.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Death, huh...?   
Well, in terms of my own death, I can't always even fully wrap my head around it.   
It's pathetic, isn't it? Especially considering how many times I've had to deal with others'...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
......   
U-Um...   
Why don't... we all try to cheer up a little?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'm not sad, though.   
Good idea.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - O-Oh, I see.   
Surprised - Umm...   
Sad - I'm sorry, Arisato-kun. I shouldn't be making assumptions...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh, um... Thank you.   
Surprised - ......   
Sad - Sorry... I think I'm actually the one who's the most uneasy right now...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looking away - It's already been a week since Ryoji-kun told us everything, huh...?   
Looking away - I couldn't sleep for three days after that.   
Looking away - It... feels weird, being this scared.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, it does.   
Everyone else is scared, too.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah... I think I'm only just now realizing...   
No one really knows how much they take their lives for granted...   
Until they think there's a real possibility they might lose it.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, I guess you're right.   
You know... I feel like no one really knows how much they take their lives for granted...   
Looking away - Until they think there's a real possibility they might lose it.   
Looking away - I don't think anyone can really understand that kind of thing until they actually feel it...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Exams begin next week.   
I know it's hard to focus, but don't ignore the present because you're worried about the future.   
That would just be giving up on life. No point in that.   
Personally, I'm going to keep on like always. I'll keep going to Tartarus, and studying too.   
I'm not leaving the ring without a win.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Arisato-kun, don't forget, it's almost time for exams.   
Sad - I've been having a hard time trying to study, though. When I'm alone, my mind wanders...   
Sad - ...Arisato-kun, do you think maybe we could study together?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exams start tomorrow, huh?   
Looking away - I guess this'll be the first time I use an exam to distract me from something else, haha...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
After I finished my exams...   
I walked around town for a little while.   
The Lost are everywhere now... Running into them is no longer just an occasional incident.   
Perhaps it has to do with the Fall.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It probably does.   
We have to do something.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I haven't thought about it as much lately, but...   
We're the only ones who can save the world.   
It's all up to us.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yes, I agree.   
We must continue going to Tartarus.   
Whether our opponent is a Shadow or fate itself, we will need to be strong to win.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Today is December 21st...   
Just ten days until New Year's Eve.   
Happy - But, for some reason... I'm actually not scared at all.   
Well, maybe I shouldn't say "at all"... But I think I'm okay now.   
Happy - I'm gonna fight.   
Happy - Whether we'd win or lose... I don't know. But I want to know that I did everything I could.   
   
Ken Amada   
There are eight more days until New Year's Eve...   
Arisato-san, do you know what you'll decide yet?   
Well, I do. I'm going to fight.   
Happy - I was thinking about it a lot, but then I realized there wasn't much to think about.   
Happy - I mean, I can't tell my mom and Aragaki-san that we failed. So... that's that.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
So today's December 25th.   
But all this talk about "death" and "fate"... What a depressing Christmas.   
Christmas will be better next year.   
That's right, I said it—"next year." We're not gonna let the world end.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The second term is over... and only five days remain until New Year's Eve.   
To be completely honest, I'm still nervous...   
However, I am no longer uncertain.   
I have made up my mind beyond the shadow of a doubt.   
I will fight until the very end.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Only four more days until New Year's Eve...   
Sad - I was really worried for a while, and I wasn't sure what I was going to do...   
Sad - I even thought my fear might completely overtake me and I wouldn't be able to decide anything...   
But I was wrong.   
I actually feel strong...   
Happy - Because everyone is with me.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - There are just three more days until New Year's Eve.   
Sad - Have you decided what you're going to say to Ryoji-kun?   
   
Junpei Iori   
The day after tomorrow's the big day. You make up your mind yet?   
Happy - I made up mine, by the way. Kinda took me a while to get there, though, haha.   
Happy - Well, you should make your choice soon, if you haven't. No changin' your mind at the last minute!

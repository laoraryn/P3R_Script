Happy - Whew! Buh-bye, school exams—hellooo, summer vacation!   
Happy - Yakushima, here we come! I can't wait for Monday!   
Happy - Maybe I oughta hit up Paulownia Mall to get some stuff for the trip!   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Oh, speaking of Paulownia Mall...   
Here, take this.   
   
Junpei Iori   
What's that?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - It's just a small reward. You all deserve a little something after studying hard for exams.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Have you heard of the antique shop at Paulownia Mall?   
It's called Mayoido.   
It just reopened today, actually.   
Happy - If you bring that to the shop, I'm sure they'll be of great help to you.   
   
Junpei Iori   
How's an antique shop gonna help us...? Am I missin' somethin'?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Hm... I can't quite explain it very well myself.   
It'd be better to hear from the shop owner than from me.   
Well then, I'll let you take care of it from here.

Is that all you need?   
   
   
Mayoido Shopkeeper   
Will that be all?   
   
   
Mayoido Shopkeeper   
Hope to see you again soon.   
   
Mayoido Shopkeeper   
Come again.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Keep shopping   
Exit   
   
Mayoido Shopkeeper   
Welcome.   
Oh, are you in high school? And you're shopping here...? Well, take your time and look around.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It seems this lady owns the antique shop.   
I should show her the    
that I got from Ikutsuki...   
   
Mayoido Shopkeeper   
Hm? What's that? Here, let me have a look.   
......   
Hmm, I see. So you're one of the ones Kurosawa was talking about.   
This is but a humble antique shop... Having said that, I believe I can be of some assistance to you.   
As long as I have something like this , that is.   
   
Mayoido Shopkeeper   
This here is a base model for crafting weapons.   
By fusing it with various materials, you can craft special equipment.   
I can help with the crafting process, but you'll have to collect the required materials yourself.   
These base materials can be found in places that tend to be quite... unwelcoming.   
That's why it'll be up to you to collect them.   
   
Mayoido Shopkeeper   
Also, if you find any gems or the like, I'd be willing to exchange them for some of my wares here.   
Well then, go ahead and have a gander.   
   
Mayoido Shopkeeper   
Welcome. Take your time looking around.   
   
Mayoido Shopkeeper   
Welcome. Make sure you get all your preparations in order.   
I don't want you failing to save the world because you ordered a new weapon too late.   
   
Mayoido Shopkeeper   
Don't you have any gems? I highly suggest you try to find as many as you can.   
I may be the only shop owner who accepts gems as currency.   
I can detect the true power of a gem, you see.   
Even if others consider them useless rocks, I may still need them. So bring the gems you find to me.   
   
Mayoido Shopkeeper   
The cards I carry can be used to strengthen your Personas.   
You can use them to offset Personas' weaknesses or enhance their strengths.   
I'm willing to exchange these cards for gems.   
   
Mayoido Shopkeeper   
Personas are interesting, aren't they?   
Summoning them must be easy for you and your friends... I've never been able to summon one.   
Although, I understand that being able to summon a Persona comes with its own set of difficulties.   
...Well, good luck.   
   
Mayoido Shopkeeper   
I wonder what the essence of a Persona truly is...   
I've studied them tirelessly, often only to end up with even more questions...   
I hope I won't be searching for the answers for the rest of my life...   
...Sorry, I don't mean to complain to you.   
   
Mayoido Shopkeeper   
How is Kirijo-san?   
...That's okay. You don't have to say anything. I was just wondering...   
...Kirijo-san has gone through so much in his life...   
Difficulties when he was younger... And the incident...   
You know, it's been ten years since it happened... This city has changed so much since then...   
...I don't know your situation, but you're always welcome here.   
   
Mayoido Shopkeeper   
I can see in your eyes that you're getting stronger. I wonder if that's because of your Personas...   
A great deal of strife is often required to awaken to a Persona, but maybe they're not all bad...   
Well, fight hard. And if you need anything I can provide, don't hesitate to come.   
   
Mayoido Shopkeeper   
The time has almost come, hm? I can tell.   
How long has it been since you started coming here...?   
To think I'm cooperating with a Persona-user ten years after I stopped working with Kirijo-san...   
But I'm glad that Persona-user is you.   
You had me on tenterhooks with how new you were... But look how capable you are now.   
   
Mayoido Shopkeeper   
I heard the news...   
Kirijo-san passed away.   
...Well, we don't need to talk about that.   
So, how can I help you today?   
   
Mayoido Shopkeeper   
Welcome. What can I do for you today?   
The ? That's quite the rarity you've set your eyes on.   
Well, that's fine. Bring me the gems and it's yours.   
Mind you, that's one of my more valuable wares, so it'll cost you more than you might be used to.   
Just let me know whenever you're ready to swap for it.   
   
Mayoido Shopkeeper   
So, you found a new base model? Ah, this will make for a fine piece of equipment.   
   
Mayoido Shopkeeper   
Oh, would you look at that? This base model is quite rare.   
I should be able to make a fairly interesting piece of equipment with this.   
   
Mayoido Shopkeeper   
Base models don't come any better than this. Seeing one firsthand is practically a spectacle.   
Equipment made with this will surely be invaluable. I highly recommend using it.   
   
Mayoido Shopkeeper   
You know of Club Escapade?   
I heard through the grapevine that the owner there's been collecting gemstones as a hobby.   
Good grief... What's he even going to do with them? I could get so much more use out of them.   
Ah, there I go again... Sorry, I don't mean to complain. What can I do for you today?

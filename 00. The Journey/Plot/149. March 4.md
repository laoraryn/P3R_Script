Happy - Yo!   
Happy - Damn, it's cold. But of course, you never miss a day of school, huh? I'm impressed.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Man, this year really flew by... We're practically third-years now.   
Happy - Only one more year of high school... Ya think there's anything interesting on the horizon?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Definitely.   
You never know.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hmm, you think so?   
Lookin' at the current third-years, I'm not really sure...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Pretty much all they do is frickin' study. Sure doesn't look like fun to me.   
Sad - Is that what we're gonna turn into next year...? Man, why do I feel like I'm forgetting something?

Aigis   
......   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, is that girl... lookin' at us?   
Happy - Dude, she's pretty cute! How come I never noticed her before?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - What are you talking about? She lives in the same dorm as us.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Wait, she does!?   
Uh... What's her name, then?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I dunno.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sheesh, then you barely know more than me.   
Anyway, it's always crazy in the dorms this time of year, with so many people coming and going.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh yeah, did you hear? Sanada-senpai's movin' out.   
You know him, right? He's the captain of the boxing team.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, not that I really talk to him. And obviously all the graduates are leaving.   
Kirijo-senpai is getting ready to move, too.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Kirijo... Oh, the student council president. She's in our dorm too, huh?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Man, what's up with that girl?   
Hey, there! Are you looking at us?   
Is something wrong?   
   
Aigis   
Oh, no... It's nothing.   
   
Junpei Iori   
She looked like she had somethin' on her mind, huh?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Wait, d'you think she might be interested in one of us!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Haha, not a chance.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - ...Man, you really know how to hit a guy where it hurts...   
   
Junpei Iori   
By the way, Yuka-tan...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Uh... Never mind. Forget it.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
What? Just say it. Now it's gonna bother me.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, uh... Do you remember how we became friends?   
   
Junpei Iori   
I mean, don't take it the wrong way. I was just wondering...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Well, it's not like we're best friends or anything, but I guess it just kinda happened.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Haha, yeah, I guess so.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - You know what's weird, though? I think I get what you mean...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I can't really explain it, but something just feels off.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Now that I think about it, that girl—   
   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Oh, crap!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The days have been going by   
peacefully, without incident...   
   
---   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
...All is quiet.   
It doesn't seem like the   
others have returned yet.   
They all must be enjoying   
the peaceful evening...   
......   
I only went to school today, but my   
whole body feels heavy and sluggish...   
I can't keep my eyes open...   
I should head to bed early tonight.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
......   
I feel so exhausted...   
I can't keep my eyes open...   
The third-years' graduation   
ceremony is tomorrow.   
I should head to bed early tonight.

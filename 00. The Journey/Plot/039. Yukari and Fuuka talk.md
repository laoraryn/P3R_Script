Hey, sorry to bother you, Fuuka...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It's okay. What's on your mind?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Well, uh...   
Sad - I was hoping you could do me a favor. With your skill, I mean.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I was doing some research on our school, and I came across something strange.   
Ten years ago, a lot of students stopped coming to school for some reason.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
They were reported as absent at the time, but I found some records that suggest otherwise.   
Do you know anything about it, Fuuka?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Me? Um, not really.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I know it was a long time ago, but... doesn't it seem suspicious to you?   
From what I've heard, this isn't the first time Shadows have appeared.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Wait, are you saying...?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I don't know. But I do wonder.   
Sad - And I'm not trying to make trouble or anything.   
Sad - But Kirijo-senpai acts kinda weird whenever someone brings up Tartarus.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Does she?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I just wanna know what happened back then. And if it doesn't have anything to do with the Shadows, then fine.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I understand.   
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

Ken Amada   
Happy - Good morning.   
Oh, and, um... Happy New Year.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Yeah. Let's make it a good one.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Happy New Year.   
Let's make the most of it.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Happy New Year to you, too, Koro.   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Arf!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Oh man... I totally overslept. Why'd I stay up all night watchin' that stupid movie...?   
It was about zombies in Italy, or somethin'... Anyone else catch it?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Why would I watch something like that?   
   
Ken Amada   
Um, is anyone gonna visit the shrine?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I already stop by enough shrines on my jogs. I'd say I'm covered.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Yeah, I'll pass. I don't wanna deal with the New Year's traffic.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Oh, that's too bad. Yukari-san and the others are already there.   
Happy - Apparently, Mitsuru-san got kimonos for all of them.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Scheming - Kimonos, huh?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Scheming - Uh, I'm gonna run to the store...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hold it.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You're going to the shrine? I thought you didn't want to go through the trouble.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - N-No, I'm not... I'm just goin' for a walk...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Uh-huh...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well, I don't have anything better to do, so I'll tag along.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Oh, I'll go too!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Count me in, too.   
See you.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Look at that, turns out we all wanna go after all.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Well, everyone else is goin', so you're not gettin' out of it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...Where is it?   
   
Ken Amada   
Oh, I have directions.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Sweet!

Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Happy New Year! Let's all give it our best!   
Anyhow, you guys are late. We were just about to leave.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Y-Yuka-tan...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Wh-What?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy New Year... Hm? What's the matter, Iori?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Kirijo-senpai... You look... amazing...   
Happy - I-I feel like I'm... O-Oh, uh, what's this feeling...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - E-Excuse me...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Happy New Year, everyone.   
I've never worn a kimono before...   
Um, my obi isn't crooked, is it?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Fuuka... Wow, you look just... Wow!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - H-Hey, c-come on...   
   
Aigis   
This traditional clothing is quite interesting. However, it's difficult to move in...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - A-Ai-chan... Considering what you usually wear, that looks even more amazing on you!   
   
Aigis   
Happy - I-Is that so...?   
What is this odd sensation I feel...?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Ah... I'm so glad I came... Best New Year ever!   
   
Aigis   
Junpei-san, why are you acting so strange?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Man, what a beautiful first dream of the New Year...   
Happy - Right, Sanada-san?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Hm...? Uh, yeah, I guess so.   
   
Ken Amada   
By the way... aren't you guys cold?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, a little, but I think it's kinda helping me wake up.   
   
Ken Amada   
Oh, that's not what I meant...   
Junpei-san said you don't have any "other layers."   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - Other layers...?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - HUH!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Wow, aren't you just a great role model for Amada-kun?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Nonono, wait, WA—   
   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hurt - OUCH!   
   
---   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - What did you wish for, Fuuka?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I... I wished for a great year.   
Happy - I know it sounds boring, but that's what I really want.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That's what I wished for as well.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - We all wished for the same thing!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - However, I'm not praying for divine help.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
There's nothing to worry about. I have the utmost certainty that we can do this.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Yeah. I know we can.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - We should get going.

Yukari Takeba   
There you are. Finally found you.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hey, Takeba...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - You hardly ever miss student council meetings. I've been looking all over for you.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Did someone ask you to come find me?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Well, yeah. I'm not a member or anything, but still.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Ah, well... Sorry about that.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
They've been pretty busy, huh? What with the class trip and all.   
It's for both second- and third-years, so I imagine you have your hands full, too.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - The class trip...   
Sad - Even if I did go, I'd only spoil the fun.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Wait, you're not thinking of skipping the trip, are you?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - You can't do that! That's not an option!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
You know, I've been meaning to talk to you.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
About what?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Well, honestly, you're not the easiest person to relate to.   
Sad - But I lost my dad, too. And I know what that's like.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Takeba...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
So I've decided I don't want our friendship to be over. I'm going to be more upfront with you from now on.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
......   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Ah, there she is!   
Happy - I've been looking everywhere for you.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Huh? Ryoji-kun?   
Exasperated* - Why are you up here?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Huh? Weren't you looking for Miss President, too?   
I was doing the same thing. Some guy asked me to find her.   
He said if I didn't, the class trip might get canceled.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Odagiri-kun... He'll hit up anyone in arm's reach for a favor.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - In any case, looks like I found you, Mitsuru Kirijo-san!   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
And I have to say, you're quite stunning. Maybe we could go out sometime?   
I know this place on the top floor of a five-star hotel.   
The restaurant up there has a view of the city nightscape that's almost as breathtaking as you.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Nightscape?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Senpai! You better head back to the meeting!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Oh, right.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Takeba... Thank you for coming to find me.   
For now, I'd better see to my duties.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Hey, she left without giving me an answer.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - "For now," huh. I don't like the sound of that.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Well, how 'bout you, Yukari-san? Care to join me for dinner?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - I know this place on Shirakawa Boulevard—   
   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Looking away - Ow!

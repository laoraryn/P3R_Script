Mitsuru Kirijo   
He's awake now.   
Let's meet tonight on the fourth floor.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Got it.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - All right, I'll see you then.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Damn you, Ryoji...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - ......   
   
---   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It looks like we're all here.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Are you okay, Ryoji-kun?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks.   
Looking away - Besides, I have more to tell you guys.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Ryoji-kun...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Then allow me to jump right in. We have many questions that need answers, after all.   
Yesterday, you said the Shadows were here to facilitate the rebirth of the maternal being.   
Tell us more about this. What happens if she returns?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - The maternal being is called **Nyx**.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Who the hell's Nyx?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Nyx is the mother of Shadows. In ancient times, she bestowed Death upon this world.   
Sad - If she awakens, the world will be swallowed by darkness, and all life will perish.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - All life!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Are you saying... everyone will die!?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - It'd be more accurate to say that we'll all surrender the will to live.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - Wait, are you... talking about the Lost!?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Everyone seems to have arrived   
at the same conclusion...   
Every single human being will   
become like the Lost...   
Leading to the extinction of mankind...   
...And the end of the world.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - The Fall...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - But there's still a way to stop it from happening, right?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - ......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Wh-What?   
Sad - Don't tell me there's nothing we can do.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Looking away - I'm sorry...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Wait, why're you apologizing!?   
Surprised - Are you saying there's no way to stop it!?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Looking away - That's right...   
Looking away - You heard the bell. That's when it was all decided.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - I'm the Appriser... The Appriser of Death.   
Sad - The fact that I'm here at all proves the Fall is coming.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - The Fall is coming...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Everyone is at a loss for words...   
It's inevitable... The entire human race   
will become members of the Lost.   
Ryoji's existence confirms the   
impending extinction of mankind.   
......   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - When!? When will it happen!?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - I don't think you'll live to see next spring.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - But... that's barely any time at all!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - ......   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - ......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ......   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - H-Heh, what're you guys freakin' out about?   
Happy - Nyx shmyx, am I right? All we gotta do is win and we're golden!   
Happy - And we haven't lost a single fight yet, have we!?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, Junpei's right.   
It's not that simple...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - You can't win...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - More like it's not possible...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Looking away - When you're up against Nyx, power doesn't mean a thing.   
Sad - It's like trying to fight the inevitable, like death or the flow of time.   
Sad - Nyx can't be defeated. She... just can't.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - What...?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - This is bullshit!   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - This is all so sudden.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Everyone is visibly distraught...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - I was born from a collection of Shadows.   
Sad - But now I have a human form, so I can talk with you, laugh with you, cry with you.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
It's the gift I received for existing within him.   
And because of that, I can give you a choice.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - A choice?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Nyx's arrival is unavoidable now.   
But you can choose to live in peace until she arrives.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
You just... have to kill me.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
If the Appriser disappears, all recollection of the Dark Hour would go with me.   
And that would erase any memories of this hopeless reality.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Looking away - There'd be no way for you to remember anything.   
Sad - When the Fall comes, it'll happen in an instant. You won't have to suffer at all.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - We'll forget everything?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - I'm saying you can go back to your normal lives.   
Sad - And by doing that, you might buy a little time and delay the Fall, too.   
Sad - Technically, I'm the same as Nyx, so I can't be killed.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
But thanks to him, there's a part of me that's become human.   
Sad - So if it's done by his hand, then it may be possible.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Ryoji-kun...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
If you don't kill me, everything will stay just as it is.   
Sad - With no hope for salvation, you'll live every day paralyzed by the fear of your impending death.   
Looking away - And I don't want to put you through something like that.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I could never kill you...   
I don't want to forget...   
I don't like either choice.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - This is something only you can do. No one else.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Well, I definitely don't want my memories erased.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Exactly.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I know...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...I don't want my memories to be erased.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - I mean, forgetting all this would be like trying to hide from the truth!   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Is that really such a bad thing?   
Sad - If you don't do this, all that awaits is despair greater than you can possibly imagine.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - You don't understand the terror of certain death!   
Sad - Don't make your decision without at least thinking about it first.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - ......   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - Why is this happening!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ......   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - You don't have to decide right now. There's still some time.   
Sad - December 31st, **New Year's Eve**. You have until then to think about it.   
Sad - After that, I'll dissolve into the blackness of the Dark Hour and lose my physical form.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Ryoji...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - When Nyx arrives, I'm going to disappear anyway.   
So please, don't worry about me.   
I'll be back when New Year's Eve rolls around.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - H-Hey, Ryoji, wait!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Stop, Junpei-kun!   
Sad - I felt Ryoji-kun's presence vanish just now. There's no point in chasing him. He's gone.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - ......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Ryoji-kun...   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - ......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - I guess... he'll be back.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
......   
...Ryoji's revelation was all too devastating.   
The world will soon perish...   
Mankind is destined for extinction...   
A difficult decision lies before me...   
Death is inevitable...   
The Appriser truly did deliver   
a death sentence to us all...   
......   
I can't think clearly right now...   
How do you even choose   
the way you want to die?

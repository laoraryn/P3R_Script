Sad - Sorry to wake you!   
Sad - Um, I'm not sure how to say this...   
Sad - But you need to go to the fourth floor! And please hurry!

Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - What's going on!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - Yamagishi detected a presence!   
Angry - Other Persona-users. They're outside Tartarus!   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - Other Persona-users? You don't mean...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Strega... They're still alive.   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - Those bastards!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - First the Dark Hour doesn't go away, and now Strega's back!?   
Angry - What the heck's going on!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yamagishi, can you see who it is?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - There's only one of them, but...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I thought she was in the hospital.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Huh?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - No, she's... she's inside...   
Surprised - Ahhh!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - What's wrong!?   
   
Chidori   
Long time no see.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Chidori?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - She hijacked the transmission!?   
   
Chidori   
I can't stand the sight of you all anymore.   
So I've decided to get rid of you.   
Come to me...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Ngh...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - Yamagishi!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I'm... okay...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - I don't get it! Wasn't she in the hospital?   
Surprised - Junpei, do you have any idea what's going on?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - ......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Junpei?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Upset - Shut up! I don't know shit!   
Upset - Goddammit!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Wha— Junpei! Come back!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
We have to go after him.   
We can't let him go alone.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
This is almost certainly a trap. But it's Strega we're dealing with. We can't just ignore them.   
And if we confront them, we might gain some insight on the current situation.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Please be careful.   
Sad - I only sensed one person, but the other two could be nearby.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
True.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - ...Arisato.   
Angry - We have no idea what they're planning, so choose your team wisely.   
Angry - We'll go after Iori once you're ready.

Junpei Iori   
Angry - Chidori! What's going on!? Talk to me!   
   
Chidori   
Angry - ......   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Doing this doesn't make any sense!   
Sad - I mean, I know I'm not that smart, and I've done a lot of stupid things...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - But this? This is wrong! We shouldn't be fighting each other!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Junpei-kun! Look out!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Horrified - Whoa!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Hey, that was close! You coulda killed someone there!   
   
Chidori   
Angry - Tch...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Chidori...! Why!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Get back, Junpei! Talking won't solve anything now!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - It's too dangerous!   
Hurt - I know how you feel, Junpei-kun! But please, just back up!

Junpei Iori   
Angry - Chidori!   
   
Chidori   
Sad - I told you... Don't touch me...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Chidori, please... Tell me why you're doing this.   
   
Chidori   
Sad - What I fear most... isn't death.   
Sad - What I fear most...   
   
Chidori   
Sad - ...is attachment.   
Sad - When I do, I become horrified by the thought of loss. My possessions, my life... Everything.   
Sad - That's why we only ever live for the moment.   
Sad - But you, Junpei... You brought me pain I never wanted.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - What?   
   
Chidori   
Very angry* - When I'm with you, Junpei, I fear everything.   
Very angry* - I fear loss, I fear death...   
Very angry* - I fear my time with you will end... That's why I...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Looking away - Chidori...?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - That sense!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - What is it?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - It's the others from Strega!   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - How did they...?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Bastards... You just don't know when to give up!   
   
Takaya   
Ugh...   
   
Jin   
......   
   
Takaya   
I refrained from interfering, as requested, and look what became of it.   
Chidori... I see that it is too late. You've been poisoned by them.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - What the hell does that mean, you friggin' ghost!?   
   
Takaya   
Happy - Hah. I am no ghost.   
Happy - Fate simply permitted me to live despite my detachment to life.   
Happy - You might say I was... chosen.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Bastard...   
Angry - That's it! I'm not letting you do this to her anymore!   
   
Junpei Iori   
[cut 3 2 0]   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - I'll protect Chidori with my life!   
   
Chidori   
Sad - Junpei...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Chidori, come with me! Don't stay with these guys!   
   
Takaya   
Happy - Hmph.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Very angry* - Junpei, look out!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Wha...?   
   
Chidori   
Jun...pei...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - Noooooo!

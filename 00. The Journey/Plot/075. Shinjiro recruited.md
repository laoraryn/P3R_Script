It's a message from Sanada.

I'd like your backup.   
   
MSG_002_0_0   
I have something important to take care of after school, and I want you to come along.   
I'll be waiting by the front gate.   
Meet me there.   
   
   
   
---   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
There you are.   
I've got an errand I want you to help me with. Let's go.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
All right.   
Like where?   
I don't really want to...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We've got a new member to pick up... Or a returning member, I should say.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Don't be like that. Come on.

Shinjiro Aragaki   
Angry - You're really starting to piss me off.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Things have changed. Sorry, but I'm not taking "no" for an answer this time.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
What?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
This belongs to you.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
......   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
There's a new threat. Persona-users, just like us.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Sad - ......   
Sad - So? That's not my problem.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That's not everything.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - ...Amada has joined our team.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
[cut 10 2 1]   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Surprised - ...!?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Surprised - What the hell do you mean!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
He has the potential, and Ikutsuki-san approved it. He's a Persona-user now.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Sad - I don't believe it...   
Sad - ......   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Tell me one more thing...   
Was it his decision to join?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah. He came to us.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
I see...   
Sad - ......   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Sad - Then... I guess I'll stick around.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
So, you're in charge now, huh?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
I got a question for you: What are you fighting for?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
To protect someone.   
For my own sake.   
I don't know.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
I see.   
Well, you do you.   
We gotta work together, either way.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
My old room still empty?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Yet another new ally has joined.   
Shinjiro Aragaki... He's a year older than me   
and seems to have lived in the dorm before.   
Though shrouded in mystery, he   
seems to be a reliable partner...

Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Juno!? Um, d-did something happen!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yukari? What's the matter?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Well, I realized it's a full moon tonight.   
Exasperated* - You did too, huh? Oh god, I'm turning into a workaholic!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Wait, is something actually going on?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We're not certain of anything yet, but... we can't find Aigis.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
What? Where could she have gone?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
At one point, I was able to sense a Persona, but I lost Aigis right after that.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - You sensed a Persona? Could it have been Strega?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Well, she hasn't detected any of them, but we can't be positive.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - I've pinpointed her location!   
Surprised - The Moonlight Bridge!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right, call the others. Let's see what's going on over there.

Koromaru   
Angry - Arf! Arf!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Aigis!?   
   
Aigis   
Determined - I'm sorry... I...   
Determined - I... remember everything...   
Determined - I remember who I am... Who he is...   
   
Aigis   
Determined - Minato-san...   
Determined - I know why I wanted to be by your side.   
Determined - I'm sorry. I failed...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What happened?   
It's going to be okay.   
Save your energy.   
   
Aigis   
Determined - I'm... sorry...   
   
Familiar Voice   
You have no reason to apologize.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - You!?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Ryoji-kun?   
Surprised - Wait, what're you doing here!?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Aigis!?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Aigis is no longer moving...   
She appears to have stopped functioning...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - What is going on...?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - It's... all my fault.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Wha— You did this!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hold on, Akihiko. He's not showing any signs of aggression.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Now tell us...   
Who—or what—are you?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Turns out, I'm not so different from the creatures you call Shadows.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - You're a Shadow!?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
I'm more than just an ordinary Shadow.   
I'm the Appriser, born from the union of the twelve Arcana.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - The Appriser?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
I remember everything now.   
Sad - The terrifying truth about the Shadows... and about me.   
Looking away - I can't... It's all so hard to believe.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You know the "truth" about the Shadows?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - I do.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - What!?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - The Shadows are here to facilitate the rebirth of the maternal being.   
Sad - As for the Appriser...   
Sad - It draws the maternal being to it, allowing her to awaken.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - And the Appriser... That's you?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - That's right.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - This "maternal being"... What is it?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - She's on a level of her own. No words in our language can describe her.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Ten years ago, a man collected hordes of Shadows and contained them in a laboratory.   
Sad - That's where I was born.   
Sad - But the unification was interrupted, and I awoke before I was complete.   
Sad - After that, Aigis took me down, and I returned the favor.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Aigis!?   
Surprised - Is this for real, Ryoji?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - She knew she couldn't destroy me completely.   
Sad - So out of desperation, she sealed me within a child who just happened to be nearby.   
Sad - That child grew up carrying me inside him. And by some twist of fate, he later made his way back here.   
Sad - He even transferred to your school.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - A transfer student? You don't mean...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - That's right. Minato.   
Sad - I've lived inside him for a long time.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Inside me?   
......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - B-But how...?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - And when his Persona awakened, the twelve Shadows did as well.   
Sad - ...All in order to become one with me.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Ryoji, you're the Appriser? And you were inside of him!?   
Angry - How the hell do you expect us to just believe all that!?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - It's... all my fault.   
Sad - I'm sorry.   
Looking away - But there's more... I need... to tell you...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Ryoji-kun!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It seems he fell unconscious.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
He's completely worn out.   
Let's let him rest for now. Aigis needs us, too.   
We'll pick up where we left off after that.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
......   
What I just heard was shocking...   
Ryoji lived inside me for ten years, waiting   
to make contact with the twelve Shadows...   
Then does that mean the boy named   
Pharos was actually Ryoji all along?   
......   
So many questions remain unanswered.   
However, Ryoji is unconscious...   
......   
We took Ryoji and Aigis home, the   
air surrounding us frigid and somber.

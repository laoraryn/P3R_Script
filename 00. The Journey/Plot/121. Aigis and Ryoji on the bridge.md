Aigis   
I've been looking for you.   
What are you doing here?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
I kinda just... ended up here somehow.   
Sad - It's so strange... The sky and the ground look all weird, and there's no one around.   
Sad - Something bad's happening right now, but for some reason, I feel at peace.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - ...Have you forgotten?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Surprised - What?   
   
Aigis   
Angry - This is the Dark Hour. Ordinary people shouldn't be free to roam about.   
Angry - But you... You've adapted to it somehow. Too well for a human.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - ......   
   
Aigis   
Angry - ...I finally understand.   
Angry - That's why I feel this way whenever you are around.   
   
Aigis   
Angry - You are dangerous. You are... my enemy.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Your enemy?   
Sad - Enemy...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - That's right... It was on a night like this with a full moon.   
Sad - It was... a long time ago.   
   
Aigis   
Angry - Yes. We've met once before.   
Angry - You and I were enemies.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Who... am I?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Who are you?   
   
Aigis   
I am Aigis.   
The last of the Anti-Shadow Suppression Weapons.   
Angry - I was created to destroy Shadows.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Created to destroy...   
   
Aigis   
Angry - And you... Your true name is "Death."   
Angry - You are the Shadow I sealed away ten years ago!   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Shadow...   
   
---   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
...Yes, ten years ago...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
On the night when I was born,   
I stood on this very bridge...   
   
Aigis   
My sole purpose is to destroy Shadows.   
   
Aigis   
That is the reason why I was given   
both a sense of self and a Persona...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
I... am the bearer of the 13th Arcana.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Everyone knew me as "Death."   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
But when I came into being, a part of my   
power was broken off and scattered...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
I wasn't at my full strength   
back then... I was incomplete.   
   
Aigis   
Even so, your power was still far too great.   
   
Aigis   
Since I was unable to defeat you,   
my only option was to seal you away...   
   
Aigis   
However, under the circumstances,   
there was only one suitable vessel...   
   
Aigis   
A human boy who had the   
misfortune of being nearby.   
   
Aigis   
I had no other choice...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Now I see... I was inside of him all this time.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
And I unwittingly led him to discover   
my twelve missing pieces...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
And then...!   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
...I get it. I understand now...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
I remember everything...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
I know exactly who... and what... I am.   
   
Aigis   
Palladion!   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Don't be foolish, Aigis...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
You can't win. I'm even stronger than before...   
   
Aigis   
A machine is created to serve a specific purpose.   
   
Aigis   
I will destroy you... That is   
my only reason for existing!   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
It doesn't have to be that way, Aigis...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
[w]   
   
Aigis   
Augh...!   
   
Aigis   
I'm sorry...   
   
Aigis   
I can't... carry out my mission...   
   
Aigis   
I'm a machine that can't fulfill its purpose...   
   
Aigis   
I have no reason... to exist...   
   
Aigis   
I'm sorry, everyone...   
   
Aigis   
I'm so sorry...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
   
Aigis   
...I'm scared...

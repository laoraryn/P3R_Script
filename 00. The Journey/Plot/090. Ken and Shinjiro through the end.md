...Do it.   
I won't stop you.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
You're right... I just wanted to forget.   
That's why I left everyone behind, and tried to use the drugs to suppress my power...   
But, nothing I did could erase the memory.   
No matter what I do, I always end up back here.   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - ......   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
It's my fault. This is what I deserve.   
But I gotta give you a warning.   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - A warning...?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
You take my life, and you're gonna end up just like me.   
You better be prepared for that.   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - What, are you begging for your life?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Even if all you have now is hatred, one day you'll regret it.

...I must say, I agree.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Surprised - ...!   
   
Takaya   
These are not his sins to bear...   
That is the nature of revenge.   
Is it not permissible to kill those who are themselves killers?   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - ...Th-That's right.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Whaddaya want?   
   
Takaya   
Losing one of our own has posed a slight challenge for us...   
But, we cannot simply turn a blind eye to all the trouble you've caused.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Angry - You bastard...   
   
Takaya   
Happy - Fear not. This life is but a stepping stone.   
Happy - I shall deliver unto you both... salvation.

Angry - What'd you say!?   
   
Takaya   
My... Protecting your would-be murderer...?   
Ohhh, but that's right! Whether or not to this boy's revenge, you are fated to die, regardless.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Sad - ......   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - What... What does he mean!?   
   
Takaya   
You've been taking those suppressants for some time now.   
You don't have much longer.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Angry - That's bullshit!   
   
Takaya   
Listen to your body... The signs have already begun.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Sad - ...!   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - What're you talking about...?   
Sad - You're just going to die... no matter what!?   
Sad - Even if I don't do anything...?   
   
Ken Amada   
Very angry* - That's not fair!   
Very angry* - This is all I've been living for... What was even the point then!?   
   
Takaya   
The cause of death is hardly of importance.   
Besides, the breath of life is faint in you as well, child.   
...You were planning to join him once the deed was done, were you not?   
   
Ken Amada   
Looking away - ......   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Surprised - Amada, what...?   
   
Takaya   
Happy - This may be a bit ill-timed, but no matter.   
Happy - It matters not whose life I take first. You're both destined to perish anyway.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Angry - Shut the fuck up!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Hurt - Ngh...!

Surprised - N-No...   
   
Takaya   
Now then, with what life you have left, answer me this...   
There is a navigator in your ranks, similar to Chidori, is there not?   
You've been killing the Shadows we wish to protect with startling efficiency, before we can even arrive.   
   
Takaya   
Tell me... Which one of you is it?   
If you don't expedite your answer, then this will hurt you more than it hurts me.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Hurt - Ugh... Augh...   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - ...!   
Surprised - ......   
   
Takaya   
Happy - ...What's wrong? Cat got your tongue?   
Happy - Or are you ready to talk?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Hurt - Th-There's... no one...   
   
Takaya   
......   
   
Ken Amada   
Very angry* - Wait!   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - ...It's me.   
   
Takaya   
Really, now?   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - ...It's the truth.   
Angry - That's the only reason they let me join, even though I'm a kid.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Hurt - Ngh... What are you—!?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Hurt - Agh!   
   
Takaya   
Angry - Quiet. I wasn't talking to you.   
   
Ken Amada   
Looking away - It doesn't matter now... I'll never have my revenge.   
Looking away - I don't have any reason to live... What's the point in fighting anymore...?   
   
Takaya   
...I see. So, you accept salvation.   
   
Takaya   
Happy - What a beautiful end to your life...   
Happy - Very well, you shall go first.   
Happy - Rest peacefully...

Surprised - Ikutsuki-san!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Aigis? What are you doing here?   
   
Aigis   
Closed eyes, concentrating - ......   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - She's simply here to fulfill her role. As a weapon, that is.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - What?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Ikutsuki-san, what're you tryin' to pull!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - You said the Dark Hour and Tartarus would disappear if we defeated the twelve Shadows.   
Angry - That's why we've been fighting this whole time! So why—   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What are you trying to accomplish?   
Destroying the Shadows, getting rid of the Dark Hour... It was all a lie, wasn't it?   
Angry - You've known since the beginning.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Excellent deduction, Kirijo-kun.   
Happy - Unfortunately, you're too little too late.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - No...   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - You tricked us!?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
It's all going just as I planned.   
It's no accident that the Dark Hour and Tartarus continue to exist.   
I never intended for you to rid the world of them. Quite the opposite, in fact.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - What do you mean?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
The twelve Shadows were parts of a whole. They were destined to be reunited.   
And thanks to your diligence, that destiny has been fulfilled.   
**Death**, the almighty, shall soon arise and bring forth the Fall.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Death?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - What are you saying? Why would you want that!?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Determined - The end shall come and free this world from despair.   
Determined - It will be the death of everything, but also the beginning.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Wh-What is he saying? Is he out of his mind?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
You see, I, too, was a scientist on the project ten years ago.   
The experiment did go awry, but that wasn't the reason the Dark Hour and Tartarus came to be.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
They manifested as a result of harvesting the Shadows' power, just as the experiment was designed to do.   
That's why your grandfather gathered so many Shadows—to initiate the Fall.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - That can't be!   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Humanity has overrun this world, turning it into a barren void in the process!   
The only hope of salvation lies in ruin!   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
According to the prophecy, the Fall will be orchestrated by a "prince."   
And once he has delivered us all, he shall rule the new world as king!   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki

Shuji Ikutsuki   
Determined - The attempt years ago failed, but the time has come at last! I am that prince.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - This is insane. Are you serious with this shit?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - I do apologize for deceiving you, but all your hard work has paved the way for the future.   
Happy - Stay at my side for just a bit longer, and you, too, will find salvation.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Find it how? By dying?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - I have a question for you.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
And what's that?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - In that video from my dad...   
Angry - He said the Shadows had to be defeated. Was that a lie, too?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - Ah... That was in fact his recording.   
Happy - Of course, I had to modify it to my specifications.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - You doctored it!?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Such an unsavory way to phrase it.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Your father, Eiichiro Takeba, was a superb scientist.   
He didn't know me at the time, but I truly respected him.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
While others focused on the Shadows' abilities, his research led him somewhere far deeper.   
But unfortunately, he couldn't comprehend the magnificent potential of the Fall.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - What?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - He left that recording at the expense of his life.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - So it seems. But it did come in quite handy. I'm sure he'd be happy knowing that.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - So you were behind it all!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
[cut 2 2 0]   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - You used my dad! And me, too!   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
"Used" is such an ugly word. It had to be done for the sake of the world.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - Our job is to right the wrongs of the past.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - And we intend to do just that.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Senpai, what're you—   
   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
I was hoping you'd be able to see the light.   
But you are just kids, after all. Maybe my expectations were too high.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Aigis!   
It's time you fulfilled your role. Capture them, and prepare them for sacrifice!   
   
Aigis   
Closed eyes, concentrating - Understood.   
   
Aigis   
Closed eyes, concentrating - Energy output... at maximum.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Aigis? What's wrong?   
Sad - Aigis, please!   
   
Aigis   
Closed eyes, concentrating - Engaging.

Surprised - What is this!?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Huh!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Dammit, I can't get these off!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - Father!   
   
Takeharu Kirijo   
Angry - Ikutsuki! What is the meaning of this!?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
It's exactly what it looks like. They are our sacrifices—harbingers of the Fall.   
All the pieces are in place, and now the prophecy shall be fulfilled.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - What!?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Bastard! You're full of shit!   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Exasperated* - My, my, how lively.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Aigis.   
   
Aigis   
Closed eyes, concentrating - Affirmative.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - Father!   
   
Takeharu Kirijo   
Angry - You traitor! Are you insane!?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Far from it. You know, your father was an unfortunate man.   
After all this time, even his own son can't comprehend his vision.   
   
Takeharu Kirijo   
Angry - My father was wrong.   
Angry - Death as deliverance is an ideology no one should ever embrace!   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Looking away - You fool!   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
You've become nothing but a burden. Aigis!   
This man will be our first sacrifice. Now, deliver unto him!   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki

Aigis   
Closed eyes, concentrating - I... I...   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Angry - Tch. Fine, I'll do it myself!   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Determined - Ten years... I've wasted ten long years!   
Determined - I am NOT like your father. I won't make any exceptions!   
   
Takeharu Kirijo

I'm putting an end to this...!

Shuji Ikutsuki   
Hahaha... You don't get it, do you?   
   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Why do you waste your time searching   
for a reason to live in this broken world?   
   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
There's no point to it at all!   
   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
The only possible way to fix this is to start over!   
   
   
Yukari Takeba   
......   
   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Ahh...   
   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Yes... Yes, I was chosen!   
   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
I'm going to be the god of the new world!   
   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Hahahaha!   
   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
What a shame... I was so close...

Mitsuru Kirijo

Crying - I became a Persona-user so I could protect him.

Everyone returned to   
the dormitory in silence...

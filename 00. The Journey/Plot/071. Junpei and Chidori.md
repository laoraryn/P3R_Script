Sad - ...It's almost the start of the second semester already.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - And pretty soon, I'm gonna be a third-year... Man, time goes by way too fast.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, it's her.   
And she's drawin' again, huh...   
   
Girl in a Dress   
You again?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Oh, well, uh...   
Actually, I'm surprised you remember me.   
   
Girl in a Dress   
I could say the same about you.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I mean, your outfit is pretty memorable...   
   
Girl in a Dress   
......   
   
Junpei Iori   
So, uh... what're you working on?   
   
Girl in a Dress   
A drawing. Why?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Uh, no real reason, I guess...   
I just thought it's pretty awesome to have something you're passionate about.   
   
Girl in a Dress   
It's nothing like that. I'm just drawing because I feel like it.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Oh, huh...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, I still wanna see it when you're done, if you don't mind.

Yukari Takeba   
Heeey, it's me!   
You got a sec?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, I'm coming.   
Just give me a bit.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Morning! I've got good news...   
Happy - Aigis is coming back today!   
Happy - Mitsuru-senpai said her injuries are all healed up.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - We're meeting in the lounge tonight. Don't forget, okay?   
Happy - See ya!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Oh, no worries! I just wanted to tell you the good news.   
Happy - Aigis is coming back today!   
Happy - Mitsuru-senpai said her injuries are all healed up.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - We're meeting in the lounge tonight. Don't forget, okay?   
Happy - See ya!   
   
---   
   
Aigis   
I've returned, everyone. Sorry to have worried you all.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Man, it's good to see you! It's been a whole month, y'know. I was gettin' nervous.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Me too. I was afraid I wouldn't see you again...   
   
Aigis   
I'm just a machine. I can always be rebuilt.   
Even if I'm completely destroyed, my programming data would still exist.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - C'mon, don't talk about yourself like that.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I was told she'd need another week for a complete recovery, but I had the work expedited.   
Tomorrow is New Year's Eve.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused.   
   
Aigis   
Mitsuru-san visited me while I was at the lab.   
Sad - I heard what happened... You've all been through so much.   
   
Aigis   
Minato-san, have you been well?   
Sad - Well, given the circumstances, I'd assume not.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Not really...   
I've been okay.   
I was worried about you.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Really? That's a relief to hear.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - I'm sorry. I could've done so much more.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Ten years ago, I... What I did to you was...   
Sad - ......   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You did what you had to.   
You had no choice.   
You did the right thing.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - But...   
Sad - If I hadn't done what I did to you, you wouldn't be suffering like this.   
   
Aigis   
As for what Ryoji-kun said...   
Have you... already made your decision?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yes, I have.   
No, not yet.   
   
Aigis   
I have a favor to ask.   
Tomorrow, when Ryoji-kun comes back...   
   
Aigis   
Angry - Please, kill him!   
Angry - I can't bear to see you all suffer like this!   
Angry - If you're in this much pain, I beg you, choose to surrender your memories!   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Even if...   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Even if it means forgetting everything.   
Sad - ...And everyone.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - A-Aigis, what're you talking about!?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Yeah, seriously! This is not like you.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - ......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What is it, Aigis?   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Why...? Why did I come back here?   
Sad - My duty is to protect people from Shadows.   
Sad - But now, it's clear that I can't defeat them.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - What am I even doing here?   
Sad - No matter how hard I try, I can't even shed a tear for you...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Aigis...   
   
Aigis   
Angry - Why do you try to fight when you know it's hopeless?   
Angry - Why risk everything when it will only lead to suffering!?   
Angry - You're all just throwing away your lives! I don't understand!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We're not throwing away our lives.   
In fact, our eyes are set on the future. Isn't that right?   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Right.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - I don't understand. Perhaps it's because I lack a life of my own.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Haha, it's got nothin' to do with havin' a life.   
   
Aigis   
I'm a machine created to protect humans from Shadows.   
Sad - But I can't carry out that duty with the power I have.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - So what is my purpose now? I just... don't know.   
Sad - And no one can give me an answer...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well yeah, we don't have the answers.   
The meaning of life or death isn't somethin' someone else can just teach you.   
Makin' your own decisions is hard, no matter who you are. No choice is perfect, y'know?   
   
Junpei Iori   
But as long as we're alive, we gotta do something.   
When you see someone goin' through the same thing you're goin' through, you just wanna help 'em.   
Happy - That's how we plan on gettin' through this.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Haha, maybe that wasn't the best explanation, but that's the idea.   
   
Aigis   
That's... the idea?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - When I saw you collapse, I realized something.   
I want to protect you, Aigis. I don't want to forget about you.   
   
Aigis   
Fuuka-san...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
There are times when you'll lose sight of your purpose, and you'll have to search for it.   
But if you can't find it again, then what you need is to seek out a new purpose.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm not really one to talk, but I feel like I've learned something important this year.   
To truly live is to be willing to change. And we have to make those choices for ourselves.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Do you think... I'll be able to change, too?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - You have changed. So much. Haven't you noticed?   
Happy - You've even started speaking like a real human.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - I understand what my purpose is now.   
   
Aigis   
I'm a machine with the directive to "live."   
And the one issuing this new command... is me.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
As it should be.   
So that's your decision.   
   
Aigis   
I'll stare fear in the face and choose to live. This is the promise I've made to myself.   
Happy - I'm not sure how I'll do it, but perhaps that's a part of living, too.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Yeah, it sure is.   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Woof!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The resolution in Aigis's heart has awakened a new Persona...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Aigis's Persona, **Palladion**, has given rise to **Athena**!   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Will you allow me to join you in this fight?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - You kiddin'? Of course, you've always been one of us!   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Thank you!   
Happy - From now on, I stand with all of you.   
Happy - No matter what happens!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Yeah!

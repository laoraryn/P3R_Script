Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It's day two of our vacation in Yakushima...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Ah, the air is so fresh.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I never thought a walk in the woods could be so enjoyable. You can't do this in Iwatodai.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - ......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - Oh, did you hear about Junpei-kun yesterday?   
Exasperated* - He was acting so indecent, I didn't know how to react.   
Exasperated* - It's probably a good thing we came out here by ourselves.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Hm?   
Oh, yeah.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Mitsuru speaking.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...One moment, let me switch over to speakerphone.   
Go ahead.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Phone Call - Well, I'm at the lab here on the island...   
Phone Call - And a machine that was considered inoperable suddenly left the facility on its own.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
A machine?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
What kind of machine is it? I need more information to locate anything other than Shadows.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Phone Call - It's a type of combat vehicle—an anti-Shadow weapon, to be precise.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
[cut 2 4 0]   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - A combat vehicle... You mean like a tank!?   
Surprised - We gotta tell the others! Where's my phone?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We're not currently with everyone, so it might take some time for us to regroup.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Phone Call - I see...   
Phone Call - In any case, I want you to handle this as soon as you can. I'm on my way there now.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
If we can't secure the target, do we have permission to destroy it?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Phone Call - I highly doubt you'll be able to destroy it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - What? Then how are we supposed to stop it?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Phone Call - Just do your best. I'll call you again later.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - ...Great, no one's answering.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Don't worry about it. Let's go back and get our equipment.   
Once we do that, we can have Yamagishi's Persona scan the area. Although, searching the whole island won't be easy...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Argh! The one time we need them, and they're nowhere to be found!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - ......   
   
---   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - This sucks so much.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - ......   
   
Junpei Iori   
What's wrong with you? I thought you weren't interested in picking up chicks.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If I'm in a match, I want to win.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Ugh...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I know what our problem is. You can't control yourself.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - What!? Don't blame this on me!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'm just stating the obvious.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - It's not like you scored either, Sanada-san!   
Angry - Why do you always gotta be so logical, even in front of babes? It doesn't make any sense!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - What'd you just say?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Junpei and Sanada continue to bicker...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - That's it! Leader, whose fault do you think it is?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
It's Junpei's fault.   
It's your fault.   
It's both your fault.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Hmph, just as I thought.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Traitor!   
Angry - Anyways, what the hell do you know... about...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - ......   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - That's ridiculous!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Hell yeah, you know what's up!   
Happy - The leader has spoken, so... now...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - ......   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - I won't accept a stalemate! It's either him or me!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Yeah! That answer ain't gonna cut it!   
Angry - And besides, what the hell do you... know... about...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - ......   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
What? Do you see something?   
   
---   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Whoa...   
Happy - Talk about saving the best for last! Now that's what I'm talkin' about!   
Happy - Holy hell, she's cute.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Yeah, she is...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oh man, this is insane. If we nail this, it'll blow our failures out of the water.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - How 'bout this time, we try goin' one by one instead of all together?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All right, I'm in.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Okay, then let's decide the order! We'll go clockwise, starting with the winner.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Ready? Rock, paper, scissors!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Rock   
Paper   
Scissors   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I lost...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Aw yeah, I win!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Okay, I'll go first, Sanada-san is second, and you'll go last.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Here goes!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Uh, hey... I noticed you've been, uh, starin' at the ocean.   
   
Junpei Iori   
So, um... you here with anyone?   
My name's J-Junpei.   
   
Mysterious Girl   
J-Junpei?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Er, um... I was just wondering if you'd be down to talk. If you're not busy, that is.   
I mean, it's more fun than standing here all by yourself, right?   
   
Mysterious Girl   
...I am looking for someone.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - O-Oh yeah?   
   
Mysterious Girl   
You are not that someone.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - ......   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Wow, you got shot down faster than I expected.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - She's a tough one, Senpai...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Heh. Don't worry about me.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Oh hey, do you like the ocean?   
   
Mysterious Girl   
Is your question directed at me?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Oh, uh, yeah. I mean, I like the ocean.   
Happy - You know, I heard something interesting about triathletes who train at indoor pools.   
Happy - Apparently, they get outperformed by athletes who train in the ocean.   
   
Mysterious Girl   
That information is irrelevant to me.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - ......   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Heh, well, I won. I talked to her longer than you did.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - It doesn't matter how long you talked to her!   
Sad - ......   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Ugh, this sucks. I could cry...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - Hey, don't cry! You're making me feel bad...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Well, that's where we are.   
Angry - If you can't pull this off, I'm gonna be traumatized for the rest of my life.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - We're on the ropes, but it's not over yet.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's all up to you now.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
All right.   
Whatever...   
I'll avenge you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
What should I say to her?   
   
Mysterious Girl   
......   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Hello.   
Can we talk?   
The tide is high...   
Hey, baby.   
   
Mysterious Girl   
You...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - I couldn't hear what he said.   
Sad - But she looks surprised. We should go over there.   
   
Mysterious Girl   
...!   
Initiating evasive maneuver. Confirmation must be made at a secure location...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Hey, what did you say to make her run away like that?   
Surprised - Well, what're you waiting for? Go after her!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, you're right.   
But it wasn't my fault.   
I don't care to.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - This could turn into serious trouble! You gotta go tell her you're sorry!   
Angry - If you don't, we'll get all the blame! Go on, you can catch her if you hurry!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
......   
I decided to follow the   
girl into the forest.   
   
   
   
---   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I lost sight of the girl...   
   
Mysterious Girl   
......   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It's the girl from earlier...   
She must be the one   
who's been watching me.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Approach her   
Wait patiently   
   
Mysterious Girl   
I was correct.   
   
Mysterious Girl   
Now I am certain...   
   
Mysterious Girl   
I have found you.   
   
Mysterious Girl   
I have been searching for you.   
My highest priority is to be at your side.   
   
Mysterious Girl - MND_008_0_0   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - WHAT!? Are you friggin' kidding me!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - What's going on? He didn't even say anything to her!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
It seems like she still   
doesn't want to let go...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - There you guys are!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - What are you doing here? We've been looking all over for you!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Um... What're you doing in the middle of the woods, in your swimsuits?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - You have no idea what we've—   
   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Huh!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Who's this?   
Angry - And... why is she hugging you?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Listen, we have a slight situation here.   
I'm sorry to interrupt your vacation, but I need everyone to go back to the house and gear up.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Ah, that won't be necessary. We've found what we were looking for.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Mr. Chairman... What do you mean?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Exasperated* - You had me worried.   
Exasperated* - You can't just leave the lab on your own, Aigis.   
   
Mysterious Girl   
...Understood.   
   
---   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Sorry for all the trouble. Everything is under control now.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
What happened to securing the tank...?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - Oh, that's been taken care of.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Aigis, join us over here.   
   
Girl's Voice   
Understood.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
This is **Aigis**. As you can see, she's a machine with the form and face of a human girl.   
   
Aigis   
I am Aigis. My objective is to exterminate Shadows.   
I have been assigned to SEES, effective immediately.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - No way. It's like she's... alive.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - This is unbelievable...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - How can a robot be this cute? What a cruel world...   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Ten years ago, a plan was enacted to create anti-Shadow weapons; a contingency in the event a Shadow became unmanageable.   
Aigis was the last one to be made. And she's the only one that still remains today.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
An anti-Shadow weapon... Does that mean she has a Persona too?   
   
Aigis   
Correct. I am capable of wielding the Persona called Palladion.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
She suffered major damage in combat her first year out, and she's been kept in the lab ever since.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
I'm still not sure as to why she suddenly reactivated herself this morning...   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - In any case, I hope you'll all get along.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - An anti-Shadow weapon, possessing a will all her own...   
Happy - This is amazing!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Uh, if you don't mind me asking...   
Sad - When we first saw you earlier, you were, uh, hugging Arisato-kun?   
Do you know him?   
   
Aigis   
Yes. It is very important for me to be by his side.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Exasperated* - Hm. Maybe her facial recognition system is malfunctioning.   
Happy - Or maybe she's still half-asleep. Very interesting.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - Hmmm...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Half-asleep?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
...Well, I can ponder this later.   
Happy - Anyhow, I forgot to mention.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - Did you know there are a wide range of recreational facilities you can use here?   
Happy - There's a tennis court, a pool table, and even a karaoke machine!   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
[cut 222 11 1]   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - Would anyone care to hear me sing?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Uhhh...

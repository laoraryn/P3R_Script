Huh?   
How did I—   
   
   
Teenager   
Whoa! Wh-What the heck is this!?   
   
Pale Young Man   
Good evening.   
   
Teenager   
...!?   
   
Pale Young Man   
Happy - Are you surprised?   
Happy - Truth be told, we all visit this world every night.   
   
Teenager   
Wh-What are you saying? Who the hell are you?

Intelligent Boy   
Angry - Didn't Mommy teach ya any manners? You haven't even introduced yourself.   
C'mon, take a look.   
Name, address, age, etcetera. This is you, right?   
   
Teenager   
Huh!? Where did you get this!?   
   
Intelligent Boy   
Somebody's got a grudge against ya, and they asked us to get revenge.   
   
Teenager   
Revenge? What kinda bullshit is this!?   
Who put you up to this!?   
   
Intelligent Boy   
Can't tell ya. We're professionals.   
   
Teenager   
"Professionals"?   
Oh shit... Those rumors online...   
You're sayin' they're true? For real...?   
   
Pale Young Man   
Shall we get this over with now?   
   
Teenager   
Hey... W-Wait... I haven't done anything!   
Why me? What'd I do!?   
   
Pale Young Man   
That is not our concern.   
Your notion of right and wrong is irrelevant. My client's wishes are all that matter.   
People hear what they choose to hear, and believe what they want to believe.   
   
Teenager   
N-No... Stay away...   
Get away from me!   
   
Pale Young Man   
Very happy* - You squeal most magnificently!   
Very happy* - Such raw emotion!   
   
Girl in a Dress   
He's not dead.   
   
Intelligent Boy   
Doesn't matter.   
We held up our end of the bargain.   
Besides, tomorrow this'll just seem like some random crime.   
   
Pale Young Man   
Well, if there's nothing else...   
I'm feeling rather tired.

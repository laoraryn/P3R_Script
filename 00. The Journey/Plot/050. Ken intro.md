Junpei Iori   
Happy - Woohooo!   
Happy - Freedom at last! What should I do now!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Exasperated* - Take it down a notch, will you?   
   
Junpei Iori   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - You bounce back from things so quickly, Junpei-kun.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - You know it!   
Oh hey, Sanada-san's here. Don't see that every day.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Ikutsuki-san called me.   
I think he wants to talk about a new candidate.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Does that mean another person is going to join?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Maybe.   
   
Natsuki Moriyama   
Fuuka!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - What's wrong, Natsuki-chan?   
   
Natsuki Moriyama   
Do you think you can stay after school with me for a mandatory study session? There's like, no one—   
   
Oh, wait. Are you about to head out for the day?   
Okay, then never mind.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Wait!   
Happy - It's all right. I'll help you.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sorry, I'll see you all back at the dorm later.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I'm really surprised at how much she's changed.   
   
Ikutsuki's Voice   
Ah, friendship. How beautiful!   
Adolescence is such a wonderful thing. So full of vibrancy!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Mr. Chairman?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Oh, hello. I just stopped by to pick someone up.   
I might as well introduce you to him now.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Hm?   
   
Ken Amada   
Hello.   
   
Elementary School Student   
Hello.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, Amada-kun. What're you doing here?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - You know him?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
He doesn't leave during the break because of his... circumstances.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Oh, I heard about that.   
Sad - Something about your parents, right?   
   
Ken Amada   
It used to only be me and my mom, but she got in an accident. So now it's just me.   
It happened two years ago.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Right now, one of his distant relatives is paying for his school expenses.   
But that doesn't mean he should stay at the elementary school dorm all by himself, right?   
So I decided to move him to your dorm, just for the summer.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - To OUR dorm!? Do you really think that's a good idea?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Why, of course. He has the potential.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Then he's the new candidate?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
That's right.   
But as you can see, he's still just an elementary school student. So, it's only a possibility for now.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
......   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Are you... Akihiko Sanada-senpai?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Uh, yeah.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - I've heard a lot about you. You've never lost a boxing match!   
Happy - Nice to meet you!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Um, yeah, nice to meet you.   
......   
   
---   
   
Ken Amada   
My name is Ken Amada. I'll be staying here for a while.   
I'll try not to be a bother, so please don't mind me.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Iwatodai strip mall, Wilduck Burger...   
   
Employee   
Good morning!   
   
Employee   
Everyone who's in the internship program, please follow me to the back entrance.   
We'll provide you all with uniforms. Once everybody's dressed, we'll get to work!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
For the next four days, I'll be   
helping out with cleaning...   
   
---   
   
Internal MES - MND_000_0_0   
I worked hard to get used to the job...   
   
Employee   
When you're done there, could I ask you to take the trash out?   
   
---   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
...?   
For some reason, Tomochika   
is in front of the restaurant...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Oh, hey... Uh, mornin'...   
Happy - You, uh, look good in that uniform. Forgot you chose this place too.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What are you doing here?   
You too?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Well, y'know... Just psyching myself up to prepare for the internship...   
I mean, being on time is like... the bare minimum job requirement, right...?   
Exasperated* - Guess my prospects are lookin' pretty grim... I overslept like hell.   
Sad - ......   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Uh, yeah. So I guess we both picked the same place for the internship program...   
Exasperated* - You're already a step ahead of me, though... I overslept like hell.   
Sad - ......   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Looking away - Nooo... Dammit! I've really screwed this one up!   
Sad - Coming in late on my first day? They're gonna be so pissed!   
Exasperated* - I know a guy who works here... He said the manager's a real hard-ass.   
Sad - Man, I really don't want to go in now... What do I do...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Nothing I can do.   
Let's go together.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Exasperated* - Well, yeah, but... C'mon, you gotta help me! Any ideas at all!?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - You'll come apologize with me?   
Exasperated* - Dude. You're the best, man!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Exasperated* - No, wait. Even if you back me up, I can't just tell them I overslept...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
...Wait a minute.   
Happy - I could just pretend I was here all along! Put on a uniform and stroll in like nothing happened...   
Happy - I'll just say my stomach wasn't feeling so good and I was in the bathroom this whole time!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - So uh, Arisato...   
Exasperated* - Please! Do me a solid. Grab me one of those uniforms and bring it out here!   
Exasperated* - I'll treat you to any food you want! You can look at my homework! So please!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Lying is wrong.   
Fine...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Exasperated* - Aw, c'mon, man! You gotta help me, Arisato!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Dude! For real? I owe you my life, man!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Angry - Just hop on in there and grab it real quick! If you hide it under your shirt, nobody will—   
   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Oh, there you are. Working hard?   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Sad - ...Seriously, why do I get stuck having to supervise two classes' worth of students?   
Sad - I'm suddenly the young and spry teacher when it's convenient... Sorry, I shouldn't be complaining to students.   
Surprised - In any case, it looks like you two are doing just—   
   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Angry - Hey, Tomochika...   
Angry - Why are you still dressed like that? Wait a minute, don't tell me...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Surprised - Well, uh, you see...   
Surprised - I may have slightly overslept...   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Angry - Are you kidding me!? How many times did I tell you all to be here not a minute late?   
Angry - Geez... First someone skipping out, and now this... Why does it always have to be my class?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Surprised - What!? Somebody skipped out? Well, that's just terrible! Talk about a failure of a human being!   
Happy - ...So who was it?   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Angry - Don't you grin at me like you've found a friend!   
Angry - More importantly, I sure hope you called to let them know you were going to be late.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Exasperated* - Uh, well... you see... I guess my schedule just didn't line up, so...   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Angry - Always call first when you're running late! It's common sense! Ugh, I'm definitely getting a talking-to later...   
Angry - You're going to go apologize. Right now.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Surprised - Wait, now!? I, uh... I need to gather my thoughts first and, uh...   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Angry - And what exactly do you mean by that? You're not trying to find some way of getting out of this, are you?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - Uh...   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Angry - Are you even aware of all the trouble you could have caused?   
Angry - You left the team short-staffed! The manager's probably worried... If this were a real job, you'd be fired on the spot.   
Angry - Now go in there and apologize. Be ready to accept whatever punishment you get.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Exasperated* - Yes, ma'am...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
So you're going in?   
You all right by yourself?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Sad - Well, yeah... I'm already pretty late as it is...   
Sad - And it is all my fault.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Exasperated* - ...Not even in the slightest.   
Sad - But... I'm the one who got myself into this.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Sad - If it makes you this upset, you shouldn't have been late in the first place.   
Remember: when you apologize, try to explain how you'll improve for next time. It reflects on you better.   
And no excuses. Make sure you really mean it. You got that?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Makes sense...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Well... Here I go. See you later, Arisato...   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Sad - Guess I should go put in an apology from my side as well...   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Oh, by the way...   
Have you heard anything from Iori?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Not really.   
Why?   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Sad - I see... Ugh, the very least he could do is call out or something.   
Oh well. You should get back to work.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Well, if you haven't heard anything, it's fine. But if he's playing hooky, there's going to be hell to pay.   
Sad - He has no idea how much trouble he's causing me... Tell him he'd better at least call out next time.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Anyway, I'll be going now.   
Happy - Put on a big smile and show them how much you love working service jobs!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I continued my work   
through the afternoon...   
Tomochika wasn't chewed out   
too badly, but he worked the   
rest of his shift in silence...   
......   
When my first day of internship   
concluded, I returned to the dorm.   
   
---   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Iwatodai strip mall, Wilduck Burger...   
I think I'm starting to get   
the hang of working here...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Oh, there you are.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Hey, Minato-kun.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Wow, you're looking pretty good. I would've thought you've been working here for years.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What are you doing here?   
Playing hooky?   
How may I help you?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
My internship ended a little early.   
I was getting hungry, so I thought I'd stop by.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Haha, I'm not looking to get on the wrong end of Ms. Toriumi's death glare.   
My internship ended a little early, so I thought I'd stop by.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Hi, I'd like to place an order...   
Happy - Haha, looks like you've got the routine down. Maybe they'll hire you full time.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - ......   
Looks like you're doing all right.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What's up?   
I'm a little busy.   
Are you ready to order?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Oh, it's nothing really...   
Sad - If you don't mind, uh... could we talk for a bit when you're done?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Right, you're still on the clock. Don't mind me.   
Sad - But... there's something that's been bothering me. Do you think we could talk in a bit?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Hmm... I'll have the limited-time combo with chili garlic fries and a coffee. Oh, and one smile, please!   
Jokes aside, there's actually something I wanted to talk to you about.   
   
Tomochika's Voice   
Hey, Arisato! Manager says to take your break.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Surprised - Wait, what? Mochizuki's here?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
I see you chose this place too. Well, my internship ended a little early, so...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
So what, you came here to rub it in my face? You better not start pickin' up chicks in here.   
Exasperated* - You are literally a chick magnet, you know that? Our sworn enemy.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Surprised - Oh, now that you're here, I'd actually like to get your opinion too, Tomochika-kun.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
About what? Lay it on me, we've got time.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You sure about that?   
Shouldn't you be working?   
Speak for yourself.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Yeah, they told me to take a break too.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
They said I should take my break now too.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Angry - Look, they told me to break at the same time as you! We're both just standing around.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Angry - C'mon, this is our chance to chill. Don't even think about wiping tables!   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Haha, you two get along pretty well, huh?   
I guess I'll go order something. You guys go ahead and find a seat.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Hold on, the manager hooked me up with some nuggets. Lemme go grab 'em.   
Happy - Not such a bad person, once you get to know each other. Just... kinda intimidating at first.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - I think this should be enough for the three of us.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Nice, you know your junk food! Now this is what being a high schooler's all about!   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
So... you wanted to talk about something?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Well...   
Sad - It's about Junpei-kun.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Surprised - Iori? Aren't you guys doing the same internship?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Yeah... We were supposed to, but he didn't show up.   
Sad - Until today, that is. I finally saw him, so we talked for a bit.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Did... something happen to him?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Not sure.   
You should ask him.   
What makes you say that?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Hmm. He does look happy on the surface...   
Sad - But it feels like he's forcing himself. I can see a hint of sadness when I look into his eyes.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - I guess I should have, but... I dunno. I couldn't bring myself to do it.   
Sad - It felt like he was suppressing an unbearable sadness. Like he was forcing himself to act normal.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Well, at first glance, he looks like he's goofing off as always...   
Sad - But it feels like he's forcing himself. I can see a hint of sadness when I look into his eyes.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Y'know, Mochizuki... you're really starting to get on my nerves.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Surprised - Huh? Oh, sorry. Why?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Exasperated* - You're that good-looking, but you still watch out for your bros...   
Exasperated* - You're too perfect! What are we even supposed to do about this guy, Arisato?   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Anyway, I dunno what's up, but I guess even Iori's not immune to getting bummed out sometimes.   
Guess that shouldn't be surprising... No one ever said being a teenager was easy.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Let's give him some space, yeah?   
Happy - He's got Arisato living in the same dorm. That's a recipe for recovery for sure.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Arisato helped me a lot, too. I'd probably still be moping around if it wasn't for him.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - So don't worry. I'm sure Iori'll bounce back in no time.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Yeah...   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Happy - Well, nothin' more to do but take him to karaoke sometime. I'll let him know you were worried about him.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Thanks, Tomochika-kun.   
   
Kenji Tomochika   
Surprised - Oh, crap, the time! I gotta get back to work!   
Surprised - I didn't even get to eat any of this. It's up to you now, Mochizuki!   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Haha, I don't think I can eat this much... Guess I'll go ask for a to-go box at the register.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - He's probably right... I'm sure Junpei-kun will be back to his cheerful self again soon.   
Especially with you around. You're his best friend, right?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah.   
Not really.   
He's got you too.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Haha... I know I'm the one who asked, but I feel a little awkward hearing that.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Haha, after how well you two get along? I think you guys make a good duo.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Yeah. I'll do whatever I can to help.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
I have to admit, I'm a little jealous. I never really had someone like that before.   
Looking away - ......   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Looking away - Before...?   
Looking away - But what about now...?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Surprised - ...Oh, sorry. Don't mind me.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Seeing Junpei-kun like that had me worried about you as well... But I guess you're doing just fine.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - It's just... I don't like it.   
Sad - Seeing you...   
Sad - Seeing my friends in pain.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - ...Sorry, I didn't mean to drag this on so long.   
Happy - See you later, Minato-kun. Good luck on the rest of your shift.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Ryoji left, and I got back to work...   
......   
With the four days of internship   
done, I headed back to the dorm.

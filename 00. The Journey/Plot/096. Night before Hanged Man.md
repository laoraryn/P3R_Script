Fuuka Yamagishi   
Tomorrow will finally be our last operation.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah...   
We've been through so much over the last half-year or so.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Don't you think?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Didn't feel that long.   
Yeah, it was rough.   
I try not to.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, I guess it flew by.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Haha, honestly though. You always seemed exhausted.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, no?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Hey, it was way better than just doin' nothing, right?   
Happy - 'Sides, we made some new friends!   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - ...Yes, that's true.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Not a single thing we've done has been for nothing.   
It's been two and a half years since I got this power... And it's been worth it.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sanada-san...   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Don't forget, we got to meet Koro-chan, too!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Still, two and a half years is a long time, Sanada-senpai...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh wait, it's been even longer for Aigis, hasn't it?   
   
Aigis   
I was in stasis for much of that time, so I haven't been operational for very long.   
   
Junpei Iori   
How 'bout you, Kirijo-senpai? You got your start before Sanada-san, right?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hm? Me?   
...Yes, it was just me at first.   
Of course, SEES wasn't around back then, and this was just a regular dorm.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Did the chairman recruit you too?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
No... He didn't.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I've been aware of the Dark Hour since I was a child...   
Once, my father's research team was ambushed by Shadows while they were investigating Tartarus.   
When I witnessed the attack... I awakened to my Persona.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - That's what happened...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Apparently, I was the first ever to reliably control my Persona.   
Sad - ...If that had never happened, then maybe none of you would be going through this right now.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Senpai...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Someone would've gotten involved, eventually. It's not like we could just ignore what the Shadows do to people.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
......   
...I suppose that's true.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
On the eve of the final Shadow, I can   
feel a quiet passion from my friends...   
I sense a strong bond with them...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Tomorrow is our last operation, so make sure to rest up tonight.

Yukari Takeba   
Oh, there he is.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Whew, that does it for our first day back...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Well, you two have perfect timing.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Perfect timing? For what?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, Fuuka, is Aigis ready?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Um, what do you think?   
   
Aigis   
This is how I look now.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Huh...? Why's she wearin' a school uniform!? What's going on here?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
She said she wanted to go to school with us, so I told the others as a joke...   
But the chairman actually agreed, so now she's gonna start as a second-year tomorrow...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Seriously!? He's down with that?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
He said something about studying her behavior in a social environment...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sounds like him, all right.   
That's hardly the problem here.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well, if he's cool with it, then I guess it's alright...   
Happy - Besides, I'd say it looks pretty good on her. Maybe even... cute?   
   
Aigis   
The school camouflage that Fuuka-san provided is more than appropriate.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - It looks very natural on you. No one will suspect a thing.   
Sad - But, why do you want to go to school? It's not like it's interesting.   
   
Aigis   
As the second semester commences, I intend to synchronize my schedule with everyone for maximum efficiency.   
If I remain here on standby, it could affect our deployment efficiency.   
To accommodate, I requested reassignment alongside our squad leader.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Deployment efficiency, huh... Why do I feel like you being at school would make that even worse?   
   
Aigis   
I will make any necessary adaptations as the situation evolves.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Uhh, sure, you do that.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf!   
   
Aigis   
He says, "I want to go to school, too."   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Koromaru... No, you definitely have to stay here, okay?   
   
Koromaru   
Sad - *whine*

Ms. Toriumi   
Class, we have another new transfer student joining us today.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Go ahead and introduce yourself.   
   
Aigis   
My name is Aigis. I am pleased to meet you all.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Aigis-san...? I've never heard a name like that... Maybe she's a foreigner.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Let's see, anything else I should know? Hm? "Humanoid"... "tactical weapon"...?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - What!?   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
...Clearly, that's a mistake.   
Happy - It just goes to show, you can't believe everything you read.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Y-Yeah, you got that right!   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Let's see. You can sit, um... Are there any open seats?   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Ooh, there's a spot, right next to him.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Okay, off you go.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Uh, Ms. Toriumi, someone already sits there. He just ditched today.   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
...Which means he's not here. So now it's yours.   
All right, take your seat.   
   
Aigis   
This spot is perfect.   
My highest priority is to be with him at all times.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Aigis!   
   
Aigis   
What is it?   
   
Classmate's Voice   
Uh, Yukari, why'd you stand up?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Uh, why—?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - ...Ugh!   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Happy - Good to see everyone's getting along so well.   
Angry - But, do me a favor and save the drama for after class.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Gimme a break...

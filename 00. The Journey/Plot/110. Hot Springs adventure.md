School excursion, day three...   
Today's itinerary: free time within the city.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Mitsuru seems to have cheered up.   
She's being friendly with her   
classmates, and especially Yukari.   
I wonder what happened...   
   
---   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Did you know this hot spring is open for guys at certain times and girls at others?   
   
Junpei Iori   
No way, really? So there's a chance it could switch to girls-only while we're still in here.   
But even if that happens, it wouldn't be on us, right?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
That's true. Something like that actually happening wouldn't be our fault.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Don't you think?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
An accident for sure.   
I don't know about that.   
Maybe we'll get lucky?   
This might blow up in our faces.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Surprised - Blow up how?   
Even still, can't help but think maybe fate wants us to be here.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Anyway, I was just asking. Not like I'm being serious.   
   
Junpei Iori   
...Hey, isn't it getting kinda hot in here?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Junpei and Ryoji seem   
to be acting strange...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
So, what time does this hot spring change from guys-only to girls-only, Junpei?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Uh, I'm not sure. I didn't bother to check. Right, Ryoji-kun?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Right? It could happen at any moment, couldn't it, Junpei-kun?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - You morons. So that's why we came at such a strange time?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Hahaha, calm down, man. We're just joking! I mean, yeah, we are here at a weird hour.   
Happy - But don't worry about it. I doubt any girls would come out here this la—   
   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - What!? Someone's here! Oh man, what're we gonna do?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Probably just another guy.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Yeah, don't worry.   
Happy - We can say we didn't know, that it's all just a misunderstanding.   
   
Familiar Voice   
Wow! This hot spring is huge!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Oh shi—   
   
   
Fuuka's Voice   
Wow, you're right. It's as big as a swimming pool.   
   
Aigis's Voice   
So this is an outdoor hot spring. Unfortunately, its therapeutic benefits have no effect on me.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Shiiit, it's them! What're they doing here this late?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Yes! Yukari-san and Fuuka-san!? This is my lucky ni—   
   
   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Shut up, you dumbass! They'll hear you!   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Surprised - *gurgling*   
   
Yukari's Voice   
Who's that!? Is someone there!?   
   
Mitsuru's Voice   
What's wrong, Yukari? Did you hear something?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Mitsuru's here, too!? Oh, man. There's no way she'll see this as just a "misunderstanding"!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Uh, you don't think she'd get us expelled for this, right?   
Sad - Like, it was guys-only when we got here. It's not like we planned this. We were just goofing around!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - You expect her to buy that? No, if she finds us, then...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - ...Then what?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - We'll be executed.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Surprised - E-Executed!?   
   
Yukari's Voice   
Yeah, I think I did hear something. Fuuka, could you check over there?   
I-It could be a ghost...   
   
Fuuka's Voice   
Um... O-Okay...   
   
---   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - We have to make our way out of the hot spring without being spotted.   
Angry - This is a life-or-death mission. If we fail, calling this an accident isn't gonna cut it.   
   
Fuuka's Voice   
Hmm, I don't see anyone here.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - That's Fuuka-san's voice. Is she going around the rock?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - H-Hey! You're leading this operation, aren't ya?   
Surprised - What the hell should we do!?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
We'll hide in the steam.   
We'll hide by the rock.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Seems like a bold move, but I trust your judgment!   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - Wow, you really know what you're doing!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Seems like a bold move, but it's just steam...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - How's that gonna help us hide!?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I'm having second thoughts...   
If my courage was at least *   
, I might've stood my ground...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Surprised - Oh, this is bad! Let's just hide by the rock for now!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Wait! We can't go that way either!   
   
Fuuka's Voice   
Is this rock formation natural?   
   
Yukari's Voice   
H-Hey, there isn't anything hiding by that rock, is there?   
   
Yukari's Voice   
[cut 4 10 0]   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Hey! Not that way!   
   
Fuuka's Voice   
Is this rock formation natural?   
   
Yukari's Voice   
H-Hey, is something hiding in the rock's shadows?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
In the shadows... No, there's no one here. See? You have nothing to be afraid of.   
   
Yukari's Voice   
A-Are you sure?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Looks like we bought ourselves some time.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - But if the wind picks up even a little, we'll totally get spotted!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Mitsuru and Aigis are probably close, too. Can't afford to be careless here. But now what?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Use the duck as a red herring.   
Just run for the exit.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - I get it. We'll distract them with noise.   
Happy - Good plan!   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Uh, what herring? And why's it red?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Minato can explain later!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - My duck? What do you want that for?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Uh, what's a "red herring"?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
There's no time to explain!   
If my  were at least   
, I could've clarified faster!   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
[cut 4 10 0]   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Dammit, the wind's picking up. No choice but to bolt for the exit!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Wha—!?   
   
Aigis   
Oh, so this is our ghost's true identity.   
   
Yukari's Voice   
What!? A ghost!?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Guess it's now or never!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - You idiots! I told you not to be careless!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Wha—!?   
   
Aigis   
Oh, so this is our ghost's true identity.   
   
Yukari's Voice   
What!? A ghost!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Aaah! What was that!?   
   
Mitsuru's Voice   
Yukari, what's wrong? What happened?   
   
Aigis's Voice   
There was a splash just now.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We know where they are now. This is our chance!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Whoa whoa, hang on!   
Surprised - We'll never make it if we just run out into the open like that!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Good point...   
Just follow my lead.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Y-Yeah, see!?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - But you said we can't just stay here, Junpei-kun!   
   
Aigis's Voice   
What's this? It appears to be a rubber duck.   
   
Mitsuru's Voice   
It's just a toy.   
   
Yukari's Voice   
But still, isn't it kind of weird to find this here?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
   
Aigis's Voice   
Hm? I detect a presence straight ahead.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Surprised - Whoa, so much confidence! You're like a natural-born leader.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Well, you got us this far. Might as well go all in with ya!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - All right, let's move!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Yeah freakin' right, dude!   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Sad - Yeah, you didn't look so sure about that, did you?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I wasn't convincing enough...   
If my  was at least ,   
we could've made a run for it...   
   
Aigis's Voice   
What's this? It appears to be a rubber duck.   
   
Mitsuru's Voice   
It's just a toy.   
   
Yukari's Voice   
But still, isn't it kind of weird to find this here?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
   
Aigis's Voice   
Hm? I detect a presence straight ahead.   
   
---   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hm? No, it couldn't be...   
   
Aigis   
What's this? It appears to be a rubber duck.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - So there really wasn't anything there, huh. Sorry, I guess I was wrong.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Is it just me, or is the water a little too hot? I'm getting kind of lightheaded...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Yamagishi appears to be stripped of her abilities when stripped of her clothing.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - W-Well, obviously!   
   
Aigis   
How intriguing. Each individual human body has its own distinct characteristics.   
To be more specific—   
   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Okay, that's plenty, Aigis. Let's go, I'll treat you to some ice cream.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Ice cream? That's a highly efficient way to cool down.   
   
---   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I don't know how, but we made it out, all thanks to you, Arisato.   
Sad - One wrong step, and Mitsuru would've had our heads.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Uh... Where'd Junpei and Mochizuki go?   
   
Fuuka's Voice   
Huh? Junpei-kun and Ryoji-kun are lying on the ground over there.   
Their faces are all red. Are they okay?   
   
Yukari's Voice   
I bet they were doing something stupid again.   
Just leave 'em alone.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Exasperated* - Looks like the heat got to them.   
Exasperated* - Guess they got what was coming.

Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Wha—!?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Ah... Aah!   
   
(SE) Yukari Takeba   
Aaaaaaaaaaah!   
   
(SE) Fuuka Yamagishi   
Aaaaaaaaaaah!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Ah! Ahaha...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - W-Wait! This is just a misunderstanding!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - S-Silence!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
[cut 5 10 1]   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - Consider yourselves executed!   
   
Aigis   
It was nice knowing you.   
   
(SE) Junpei Iori   
Aghhh!   
   
(SE) Akihiko Sanada   
Gaaagh!   
   
(SE) Ryoji Mochizuki   
Ahhh!

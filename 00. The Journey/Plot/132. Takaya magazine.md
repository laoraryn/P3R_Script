Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oh, there you are.   
Happy - We're all going to Hagakure. Wanna come?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure.   
I'm not hungry.   
I don't like ramen.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Wow, that was easy.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - What, you on a diet or somethin'?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Huh? Seriously? I didn't even think about that...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Sanada-san's buying today. You remember that bet we made in Yakushima?   
Happy - Oh, you probably forgot all about it by now.   
Happy - Well, you won in the end... even if it was Aigis.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - But whatever, Sanada-san still lost, right? Even if it took me, like, six months to make him admit it...   
Happy - C'mon, everyone else already left. We gotta jet!

Yukari Takeba   
Everyone's okay with the special, right?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sounds good to me.   
I'm fine with whatever.   
I'll have the regular.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Okay, five specials, please!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Okay, four specials and one regular, please!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Man, this is awesome!   
Happy - Sanada-san's NEVER treated us all to ramen before.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - I'll accept that I lost, but why do I have to treat all of you?   
   
Junpei Iori   
You're still goin' on about that?   
Happy - C'mon, Sanada-san, a bet's a bet. Ya gotta pay up!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - All right, all right! I never said I wouldn't.   
   
Aigis   
......   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - What's wrong, Aigis? You doubting me, too...?   
   
Aigis   
No, but...   
Have you seen the magazine on the counter? The headline caught my attention.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
What magazine?   
   
Aigis   
This one...   
"Emergence of a Messiah: The Charismatic One Speaks."   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, it must be about that doomsday cult. They're all over the Internet, too.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Huh...   
...?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
[cut 4 4 0]   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Hey, look at this photo! Check out their so-called "Messiah"...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Wh-What the—!?   
Surprised - Is that... Takaya!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I thought something was up. So, it's Strega, after all...   
I just lost my appetite.   
   
Aigis   
Listen...   
   
Aigis   
"Mankind is currently imprisoned by the sins of hate and anger."   
"But soon, a savior will descend upon this world to break the chains that bind us, and lift us to new heights."   
"This great being is known as Nyx. I have beheld her glory, and she has blessed me with power beyond belief."   
"When Nyx arrives... there will be no more pain, no more suffering. Humanity shall be freed..."   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - How the hell does he know about Nyx!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Wait, he's saying that Nyx will save the world!? But that's a lie!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I don't think that even matters. This is all just a game to him.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - That bastard...   
   
Aigis   
"But there are those who do not understand the truth even though they have also been granted her blessing."   
"They have acquired the same power as I, yet they abuse it for their own personal gain."   
"These miscreants are the ones to blame for the recent tragedies that have been plaguing our streets."   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Wait, is he talking about us!?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's a load of crap.   
You're too loud.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Shhh! Not so loud! We're not the only ones here, you know!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - R-Right, right, sorry... But can you blame me...?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - And what do they mean by "the charismatic one"?   
Angry - Why's he suddenly a celebrity?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Well, apparently Jin was already pretty well-known on the Internet...   
Angry - He's probably good at influencing public perception.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Yeah, I bet he orchestrated Takaya's rise to fame by building his brand like a celeb...   
Angry - Ugh, those two make me sick...   
   
Aigis   
"Brothers and sisters, I shall go forth to make preparations for Nyx's arrival..."   
"But do not fear those evildoers who desecrate their gifts. Nyx shall right their wrongs."   
"May your hearts be filled with peace as you await your salvation."   
"Blessed are those who take joy in the coming of Nyx."   
"The revolution is upon us, my brethren!"   
   
Junpei Iori   
"Revolution"? People can't seriously be buying this crap, can they?   
   
Aigis   
"Perhaps the power of an exceptionally charismatic individual is the only way to change this nebulous future..."   
   
Aigis   
...That's the end of the article.   
It appears Strega disappeared again after the interview.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well, there's only one place they could've gone—Tartarus.   
Hmph... They're just wasting everyone's time.   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Still, it seems they've managed to shift the atmosphere of the entire city.   
Sad - Even if they don't say it out loud, people must be scared inside...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Yeah, they probably are.   
Sad - Why else would anyone believe this nonsense? It's not normal.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Believing what you hear is a choice. There's no real way for them to know what's true.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Looking away - Well, no wonder it feels like the world's ending... We're all gonna die.   
   
Aigis   
But is that so unusual?   
   
Aigis   
All life will eventually come to an end. Does Nyx's involvement change that in some way?   
Death is a natural occurrence in the cycle of life. Don't all humans realize this?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
They're not ready to die.   
Dying is a scary thought.   
They want an escape.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - I guess...   
   
Junpei Iori   
To tell you the truth, I never even woulda thought about my own death if none of this happened.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - But we're already here, so why don't we just leave it at that?   
Scheming - Our target is Nyx. If Strega gets in our way, we'll deal with them, too. That's all there is to it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Agreed.   
We'll probably run into them in Tartarus, anyway...   
No matter how you look at it, they want us out of the picture.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - The Promised Day's almost here, huh...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Looking away - Yeah...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We need to do all we can until then.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Alright... Then first things first, we're gonna need lots of energy! Let's eat!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Excuse me! I'll add a Hagakure Bowl to the list!   
Happy - You don't mind, right, Sanada-san?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Whoa, Junpei, didn't you say you were eating half of Aigis's food too?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oh, don't worry. I'm starving.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Exasperated* - ...You better eat it all.

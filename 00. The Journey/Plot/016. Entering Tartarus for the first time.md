Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Whew, I'm tired... I was about to fall asleep.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Can I have a minute?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Come to the room on the fourth floor when you get back to the dorm tonight. I have something to tell you all.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oh, are we having that talk already?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'll save the details for later. See you there.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Damn, she doesn't waste any time...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
She's not like us. She's busy, you know? With the student council or whatever.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Whoa, Yuka-tan! Do I sense some hostility?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - It's not that I don't like her, it's just... I dunno.   
   
---   
   
Junpei Iori   
Okay, school day's finally over.   
Happy - They're probably waiting for us at the dorm, right? Let's hurry back!   
   
---   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Whew... Finally made it.   
Sad - Can't believe the accident delayed our train so much... It's already dark out.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Been happening a lot lately, though. People jumpin' onto the tracks.   
This Apathy Syndrome thing's gettin' outta control. It's like the whole world's fallin' apart.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Ah crap, everyone else is there already. We better hurry!   
   
---   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Oh man, I'm gettin' kinda hungry...   
Happy - This mall rocks! So many places to chow down. Plus, they're open late!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Speakin' of, I heard the ramen joint upstairs has a secret late-night menu...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
We'd better hurry to the dorm.   
Maybe next time.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Y-Yeah, yeah, I know...   
   
---   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Happy - All right, everyone's here.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Heck yeah! Let's get right into it!   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Now, I'd like your undivided attention.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
For a long time, Kirijo-kun and Sanada-kun were the only Persona-users we had.   
But that number has recently jumped to five.   
So, here's the plan.   
Starting tonight at 12 AM, I'd like us to finally begin exploring **Tartarus**.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Uhh... So I asked this yesterday, but what is that Tartar thing again?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...It's Tartarus. You seriously haven't seen it, Junpei?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - I mean...   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
It's no surprise you haven't seen it.   
Tartarus only appears during the Dark Hour, after all.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Only during the Dark Hour...?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Just like the Shadows... Interesting, huh?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
The goal of our club—SEES—is to fight those Shadows. However...   
Simply defeating Shadows during the Dark Hour isn't enough.   
We must get to the root of the problem. We need to destroy the Dark Hour itself.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Uh, I don't really get it...   
You're sayin' if we run around Tartarus, we can somehow get rid of the Dark Hour?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
We don't know for certain.   
Sorry I can't give you a better answer, but investigating the mysteries of that tower is part of our job.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The bottom line is: we need more information.   
Everything we encounter there will be a vital clue for us.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
The exploration of Tartarus is of utmost importance. Consider it our top priority.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Our society, while remaining blissfully unaware of the Shadows, is slowly but surely succumbing to their influence.   
I would go as far as to say that the fate of the world rests on the shoulders of you Persona-users.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - ...That's one hell of a responsibility, but the heroes of justice will prevail!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - It's also the perfect spot for us to train and improve our skills.   
That place is like a nest of Shadows, you know.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Whoa... Their nest, huh...?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - But Senpai... what about your injury?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Akihiko's still recovering from his wounds. He'll accompany us, but won't participate in the exploration.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - ...Yeah, I know.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Relax, ol' Junpei's got your backs!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - I'm not so sure about this...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What about you, Mr. Chairman?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
I'll stay here.   
Exasperated* - Not much point anyway, since I can't summon a Persona...   
   
---   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Huh? We're here...?   
Surprised - Uh, what's goin' on? Why are we at school?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Just wait and see.   
It's almost midnight.   
   
---   
   
Junpei Iori   
Wha...?   
   
---   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
This is Tartarus—the labyrinth that reveals itself during the Dark Hour.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Labyrinth...?   
Surprised - What are you talking about!?   
Surprised - What happened to our school?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Once the Dark Hour passes, everything will return to normal.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - This is the "nest" you were talking about!?   
Surprised - But, why!? Why'd our school turn into a giant tower!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ......   
   
Junpei Iori   
You don't know either?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ...No.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I'm sure it's complicated.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
If we don't know, we'll just have to find out.   
Mitsuru and I have only gone in to take a peek; this'll be our first time exploring it.   
Happy - Exciting, huh?   
Happy - There's gotta be something in there. Hopefully some sort of clue about the Dark Hour.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Akihiko. I respect your enthusiasm, but you won't be exploring it today.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - I know... You don't have to keep reminding me.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
So this is Tartarus...   
In any case, we decide to enter the tower...   
   
---   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Whoa... It's just as crazy on the inside.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Sure is creepy, though...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
This is only the entrance. The labyrinth lies beyond the doorway at the top of these stairs.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
First, you need to get a feel for the place.   
Why don't the three of you go have a look around?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - What!? By ourselves!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We're not asking you to go very far.   
I'll help you navigate by feeding you information from here.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We'll also need to appoint a leader to make any necessary decisions.   
   
Junpei Iori   
A leader?   
Happy - Like... the captain of a pirate ship!?   
Happy - I'm in! Me me me! Pick me!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
......   
Arisato, you're in charge.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - W-Wait! Why him!? He doesn't look like a captain!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Calm down. He has experience fighting already.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Wait, seriously?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That's true too, but the main reason is far more simple.   
Junpei... And you too, Takeba...   
Can either of you summon your Persona without difficulty, like he can?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Y-Yeah, of course I can!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Me too.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
These are Shadows we're talking about. Without your Persona, you're screwed.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - I'm aware of that.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All right, let's head inside. Are you ready, Leader?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
1. I'm ready.   
2. I'm not mentally prepared...   
   
===1===   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Heh, that's the spirit.   
   
===2===   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - It all feels so sudden, doesn't it?   
Happy - But hey, I'll be right there with you. C'mon, let's go.   
   
=======   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The blue key in my hand is shining...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
What's the matter?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
...?   
A strange door is sitting in   
the corner of the lobby...   
   
---   
   
   
Igor   
I've been waiting for you.   
The time has come for you to wield your power.   
The tower that you are about to venture into... How did it come to be? For what purpose does it exist?   
Regrettably, you are not yet capable of answering these questions.   
That is why you must be made aware of something before you go any further.   
You must understand the nature of your power.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
1. The nature of my power?   
2. About that door...   
3. I don't want to know.   
   
===2===   
   
Igor   
The door you just passed through is the entrance to this realm. Of course, no one but you can see it.   
   
===3===   
   
Igor   
Please, you must understand... It is of the utmost importance.   
   
=======   
   
Igor   
Your power is unique.   
It is like the number zero... Empty, but at the same time holding infinite possibilities.   
You, my boy, are able to possess multiple Personas and summon them at will.   
And when you have defeated your enemies, you will see the faces of possibility before you.   
There may be times when they are difficult to grasp... But do not fear. Seize what you have earned.   
Your power will grow accordingly... Be sure to keep that in mind.   
   
Igor   
Now, then... My spare time will soon be scarce.   
Next time, once again, may you open the door and come here of your own accord.   
I'll tell you then about my true role... The manner in which I can best assist you.   
   
Igor   
Until we meet again... Farewell.   
   
---   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Hey, are you all right?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Yeah, what's up? You look like a zombie.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
1. Nothing.   
2. I opened this door and...   
   
===1===   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Don't tell me you dozed off!   
Surprised - Y-You're like that coach who fell asleep during the championship game!   
Sad - Come on, man. You're s'posed to be our leader.   
   
DEV: Internal MES - MND_004_0_0   
They don't seem to see the door.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Cut him some slack. If nothing's wrong, then let's get going.   
   
===2===   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Huh? What door?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Man, are you loco?   
   
DEV: Internal MES - MND_008_0_0   
They don't seem to see the door.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Have you been nodding off? You seem kinda out of it.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Dude, you're s'posed to be our leader. Get your head in the game!   
   
=======   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - We'll be following you. Come on, let's go.   
   
---   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - So it's the real deal from here on, huh?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Looks easy to get lost in...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Can you all hear me?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Whoa! Is that you, Senpai?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'll be providing audio backup from here on out. Keep that in mind.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Wait... Are you sayin' you can see this place from all the way out there?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's my Persona's ability.   
The structure of Tartarus actually changes from day to day.   
Sad - I'd like to join you up there, but we need someone to provide outside support.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - That's even more concerning...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Now, based on your current location, you can expect to encounter enemies at any time.   
They shouldn't be too tough, but proceed with caution.   
You'll get the hang of it as you go.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Right!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Got it.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Why is she always like that...?   
   
---   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Welcome back.   
So, Arisato, how was it?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
1. No problem.   
2. I don't know about this...   
3. I'm exhausted.   
   
===1===   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - I see. Well, if you gained confidence, that's the best thing you could have achieved.   
   
===2===   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Don't be discouraged.   
You completed your task, and that's something to be proud of.   
   
===3===   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - It must've hit you all at once.   
Happy - Don't worry, you'll get used to it.   
   
=======   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Wow... I never knew I had that kinda power!   
Sad - But damn, why do I feel so exhausted?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - 'Cause you were bouncing around like a little kid.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - You say that, but you look pretty tired yourself, Yuka-tan.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - This is different... It's like I'm having trouble breathing. What's going on?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That's the effect of the Dark Hour. You'll become fatigued more easily.   
Don't worry. You'll get used to it.   
Happy - I have to say, though... I'm surprised. You all did much better than I expected.   
Happy - At this rate, they'll catch up to you in no time, Akihiko.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Heh, we'll see about that.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
By combining my powers with the team's,   
I was able to stand against the Shadows...   
I sense a strong bond with them...   
...!?   
   
[fool rank 2]   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Just like Yukari and Junpei,   
I feel tired as well...   
I decided that it would be best   
to return to my room and rest...

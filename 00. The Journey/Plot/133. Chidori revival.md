Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm sorry to ask this so suddenly, but... can you come with me? There's... something we need to discuss.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Uhhh, you want all of us, or just him?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Just him for now.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Come with me to the student council room.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Isn't it... kinda weird that she'd only want to talk to him?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Eh, probably big, important student council business.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Maybe, but Senpai was acting a little weird...   
Sad - She had that look she gets when she's keeping some terrible secret.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Eh, you worry too much.   
Welp... Guess we might as well head home.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, wait a sec, Junpei! According to the seating chart, if he's not here, you have to take over cleaning duty.   
Have fun sweeping the hallway!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Whaaat!? Since when!?   
   
---   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
There's something you have to know.   
Do you remember Chidori, the girl who was with Strega?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - I don't mean to alarm you, but...   
Sad - The truth is... there's a chance that she may wake up today.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
...!?   
Chidori is still alive...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - I know what you're going to say. And yes, we did see her die with our own eyes.   
However... a few days later, her body began to undergo transmogrification.   
For the past few weeks, she's been in a sort of stasis, neither living nor dead.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
How is this possible?   
Why didn't you tell us?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - I don't know.   
Sad - It may be related to her Persona's abilities, but that's mere speculation.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Honestly... I didn't know if I should.   
Sad - There was a chance I could've made things worse without knowing whether she would live or die.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - The reason I wanted to talk to you is... How do you think we should tell Iori?   
Looking away - You see, she's probably—   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yes, it's me.   
Sad - I see.   
Sad - Yes, I understand.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That was the hospital.   
They say she's just awakened.   
Sad - It's hard to believe, but it seems that Chidori really has come back to life—   
   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - D-Did I hear that right...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Iori!?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Chidori is...?   
Surprised - Huh...? I-Is this a joke? Some kinda trick...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
No... It's not a joke, or a trick. She's currently recovering in the same hospital as before.   
Sad - But... Iori... She probably...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Chidori...   
Chidori's... alive...?   
Angry - ......   
   
Yukari's Voice   
Wha— Hey, Junpei! What about your cleanup duty!?   
Geez... What's gotten into him?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Exasperated* - Well, I guess it's a moot point now...   
But... perhaps it's for the best that he found out this way.   
I think I'll head to the hospital after this, too. Could I ask you to come along?   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
We all decided to go to Tatsumi   
Memorial Hospital together.   
   
---   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Huh...? Junpei!?   
You took off that fast, and you still haven't gone inside?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Well... I mean, it's kinda...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We'll wait outside. It wouldn't be good for all of us to charge in...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I agree. Go on, Iori...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Arisato, you go in too.   
   
Junpei Iori   
......   
   
Chidori   
...?   
   
Chidori's Doctor   
Her damaged endocrine system and other internal organs have completely healed.   
She's still weak, but... there's no more danger of her dying in two years.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Chidori... Is it really you?   
I'm not dreaming... am I...?   
   
Chidori   
Dreaming...?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy tears* - ......   
Happy tears* - It's true... It is you... Chidori...   
   
Chidori   
......   
Who... are you?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Huh...? Wh-What...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - I thought so...   
Sad - Transmogrification is the proof that one lacks "potential"... I had a feeling this might be the case.   
   
Chidori's Doctor   
This is Kirijo-san and Iori-kun. They were your friends last year.   
   
Chidori   
Friends...?   
Sad - ......   
   
Chidori   
Sad - My name is Chidori Yoshino.   
Sad - I'm sorry... It hasn't quite hit me yet, but I guess I don't remember anything of the past few years...   
Sad - It's like... I was having a really long dream.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Chidori... Yoshino...   
   
Chidori's Doctor   
It seems all of her memories after she awakened to her Persona are gone.   
She remembers everything that happened before then, but as for you all...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Looking away - ......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Iori...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Nah... I think... it's better for her that she doesn't remember.   
Sad - All that stuff about the fighting, and the suppressants...   
Sad - When you're having a nightmare... it's better to be able to wake up.   
   
Chidori   
Angry - I didn't say it was a nightmare. Don't put words in my mouth.   
   
Chidori   
Happy - It was a dream of meeting a kind, warm person at the end of a long tunnel...   
Happy - I can't remember it clearly... But I wanted to make him happy, and I...   
   
Chidori   
Sad - I think... there were flowers... A room filled with them...   
   
Chidori   
Hurt - Ngh...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Chidori! Take it easy, don't force yourself to remember.   
   
Chidori's Doctor   
Flowers in a room...   
If she can remember that part clearly, then maybe...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...?   
   
Chidori's Doctor   
Do you remember how she'd occasionally use her power to make flowers bloom again?   
   
Chidori's Doctor   
She'd always do it for the flowers in her room on the days when Iori-kun would visit.   
And she would always spend more time on the flowers she received from you, Iori-kun.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - She never even looked at me when I brought them in though...   
Happy - Heheh... Now I see.   
   
Chidori's Doctor   
Any flower she touched would be mysteriously preserved...   
I ended up keeping them all for my research.   
But after the autopsy, I put them all on her chest as a tribute.   
Now that I think about it, that must have been the night she began to transmogrify...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The power to share one's life with others...   
Could she have reclaimed the life energy she'd given to those flowers...?   
   
Chidori's Doctor   
Well, there's no real proof...   
But, compared to her previous state, she's changed. The loss of her power is part of it, but furthermore—   
   
   
Chidori   
Angry - Excuse me... Are you talking about me?   
   
Chidori's Doctor   
We were talking about how you want to live now...   
   
Chidori   
...?   
What do you mean by that? Of course I want to live.   
Happy - I have to find the person in my dream someday... I don't have time to lie in bed forever.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Supposing you do find him... What will you do after that?   
   
Chidori   
Well...   
......   
Angry - That's none of your business.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Chidori...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - The strength of two hearts connected brought about a miracle...   
Happy - Or rather, a victory.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy tears* - Oh, Chidori...   
   
Chidori   
Surprised - H-Hey... Why are you crying?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy tears* - I-I can't help it...   
Happy tears* - I... I've...   
Happy tears* - I've never been so happy in my entire life!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy tears* - Waaahhhhh...!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Haha, have some self-control now...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Let's go, Arisato.   
   
（ＳＥ）岳羽 ゆかり   
…うっ…   
   
（ＳＥ）山岸 風花   
ひぐっ…   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...?   
   
Yukari's Voice   
*sniffle*   
   
Fuuka's Voice   
*sniffle*   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Ha...

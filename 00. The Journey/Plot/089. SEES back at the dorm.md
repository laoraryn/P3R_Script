Huh... No one else is back yet?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Man, I wonder why Sanada-san was acting so weird. Somethin' about the date?   
What's so special about October 4th?

Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - October 4th...! That's right!   
Angry - I was so focused on the operation that I didn't realize it...   
Angry - Today is the anniversary of the day Amada's mother was killed!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - She was killed...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - Yamagishi, I need you to locate Aragaki and Amada immediately.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - There's a good chance they'll be together. Akihiko must have already realized it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - I-I'm on it.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Uh... What's going on?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - Public records say that Amada's mother was killed in an accident...   
Sad - ...But in truth, we were the ones responsible for her death.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - What...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - It happened **two years ago, when we were hunting down a Shadow** that appeared in the city...   
Sad - Aragaki had only just awakened his Persona, and he lost control of it for a moment.   
Sad - We'd been so focused on the Shadow, we hadn't accounted for any civilians in the area.   
Sad - Unfortunately... there was one casualty.   
Sad - ...It was Amada's mother.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - No way... Are you kidding me!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Wait, so to Amada-kun, Aragaki-senpai is...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - I should've considered this when Amada volunteered to join us. It's possible that he...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I've found them! They're at Tatsumi Port Island!   
Sad - They're together, and I'm picking up someone else, too...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - Is it Akihiko?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - Wait... This is...   
Very angry* - No! It's Strega!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Hey, isn't that a problem!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - Ngh... This couldn't be worse!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Senpai!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - C'mon! We gotta follow her!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - R-Right!

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sorry to wake you!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm detecting a Shadow! Please come to the fourth floor quickly!

Junpei Iori   
Angry - What's goin' on?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
There's a Shadow in the city. Yamagishi found it unexpectedly.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - What? But the moon isn't full yet...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It seems to be just a regular Shadow.   
Sad - But there usually isn't any normal Shadow activity outside of Tartarus.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's near Naganaki Shrine. Akihiko was already in the area, so he went ahead.   
I'm sure he can handle it alone, but we should be ready just in case.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Gotcha!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Yes, this is Yamagishi.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'm here. Sorry, but I think you guys better come quick.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What's wrong? Are you in trouble!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
No, the Shadow's been defeated.   
...Or rather, it was already defeated when I got here.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What happened?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
This little fella took a hit for me. I wanna save him if we can.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - "Took a hit"? Who's he talking about?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Don't ask me.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
At any rate, let's move out.

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Koro-chan!   
   
Koromaru   
Sad - *whimper*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - Are you okay, Koro-chan!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You know this dog?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Yeah, everyone around here does.   
Sad - We've gotta help him, quick!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - First, we need to stop the bleeding.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Man, he's one tough fighter.   
He defeated that Shadow all by himself.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Wait, does that mean... this dog's a Persona-user!?   
   
Aigis   
He says, "This is a place of peace, so I protected it."   
There are flowers over there.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Those flowers... They must be for the priest who died in the accident here.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - So he really was guarding this place.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Okay, hold on. Aigis, don't tell me you can translate dog language too!   
   
Aigis   
Canines do not have their own language. However, speech is not the only means of communication.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
This fella really is a rare breed.   
   
Aigis   
Correct.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - He's not the only one!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right, let's report to the chairman so we can conclude this mission.   
As for a vet, it's midnight, but I think I can arrange something.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Good job, boy. You're one amazing dog.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf...

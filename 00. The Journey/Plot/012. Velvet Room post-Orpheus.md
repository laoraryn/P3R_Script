Igor   
It's so good to see you again.   
You lost consciousness after awakening to your "power."   
   
Igor   
Ooh, I see that it was Orpheus who heeded your call. Very interesting...   
That was the power of Persona... The manifestation of your psyche.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
1. Persona?   
2. My psyche?   
3. I don't understand.   
   
Igor   
A Persona is a facet of your personality that surfaces as you react to external stimuli...   
You can think of it as a mask that protects you as you brave many hardships.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
1. A mask?   
2. I don't get it.   
   
Igor   
The power of a Persona is the power of one's soul... And the soul is fueled by the depth of one's bonds.   
As you form these bonds by becoming involved with others, your own Social Links will gradually develop.   
The strength of these Social Links will foster the growth of your Persona abilities.   
Please remember this.   
   
Igor   
Now, then...   
Time marches on in your world.   
I shouldn't keep you here any longer.   
Next time we meet, you will come here of your own accord.   
   
Igor   
Until then...   
Farewell.

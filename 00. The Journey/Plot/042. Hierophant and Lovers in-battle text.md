Fuuka Yamagishi   
This large Shadow is of the Hierophant Arcana!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - We don't know what it'll do. Be ready for anything!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - That skill seems to instill fear in its opponents!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - You'll be paralyzed if you succumb to the fear. Don't push yourself, and try to calm down!

Voice in Your Head   
I am the voice of your inner self...   
Revel in the moment...   
That which cannot be felt is merely a dream... The present is all we have.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's right...   
That's not true...   
Who cares...?   
   
Voice in Your Head   
The future is but a fantasy, memory a fabrication...   
Let your desire free you from your shackles... Such is your wish...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I can't give in...   
Maybe so...   
I don't understand...   
   
Voice in Your Head   
Pleasure is what you truly seek.   
You stand before the doorway to bliss.   
You cannot deny your instincts... Embrace your desire...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I don't really get it...   
I'm listening...   
I'll pass...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
My consciousness is starting to blur...   
But I know I still have work to do...   
   
Voice in Your Head   
Why do you resist...? Do not avert your eyes from the truth...

Akihiko Sanada   
So you guys were one floor below, huh.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Didn't expect another one to be there...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Anyway, you two come out of it all right?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Uh... We're fine.   
Anything happen to you?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Y-Yeah! Nothing weird on our end!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - N-Nothing odd! Nothing at all!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh! Could it be...!?   
Angry - I get it! It's the mirrors!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - The readings from the mirrors in the guest rooms seem to be resonating with the main Shadow!   
Happy - If we can destroy those mirrors, then maybe we'll be able to break the barrier.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All right... So what rooms are these mirrors in?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I sense something from rooms 204 and 205!   
Try heading to those two rooms first!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We're wasting time...   
Happy - We need to figure this out...

Junpei Iori   
Happy - There ya are!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Man, I didn't think there'd be another Shadow.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Anyway, you two okay?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Uh... We're fine.   
Anything happen to you?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Y-Yeah! All normal on our end!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - No, of course not. Nothing happened!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh! Could it be...!?   
Angry - I get it! It's the mirrors!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - The readings from the mirrors in the guest rooms seem to be resonating with the main Shadow!   
Happy - If we can destroy those mirrors, then maybe we'll be able to break the barrier.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - O-Okay... I don't really get what's goin' on, but which ones are we supposed to break?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I sense something from rooms 204 and 205!   
Try heading to those two rooms first!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Not again... This isn't getting us anywhere.   
Happy - C'mon, let's go.

Junpei Iori   
Happy - There you are!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Man, I didn't think there'd be another Shadow.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Anyway, you two okay?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Uh... We're fine.

Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Y-Yeah! All normal on our end!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - N-Nothing odd! Nothing at all!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Good, we're all together again.   
I didn't expect to run into another Shadow...   
On that note, you seem to be in one piece. Anything unusual happen?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - E-Everything went smoothly for me, of course.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh! Could it be...!?   
Angry - I get it! It's the mirrors!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi

Mitsuru Kirijo   
Well done. Can you tell which rooms have these mirrors?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I sense something from rooms 204 and 205!   
Try heading to those two rooms first!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Damn, it got us again... What the hell's goin' on?   
Happy - Just gotta keep goin', I guess. I can't wait to kick this guy's ass!

Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The door won't budge.   
A strong force seems to be holding it shut.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - ...!   
Surprised - No way... Why!?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - I still sense a Shadow in that room!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Huh!? But we just...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - It's not the same one from before!   
Sad - But... where is it hiding?   
   
---   
   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - This one's from the Lovers Arcana... It's the source of the mind manipulation.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Unforgivable... I'll never forgive you for that!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - Y-Yukari-chan...!?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - This mist...!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - Please be careful! That mist can hypnotize you.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - It's the same as before. Look out for the enemy's psychological attack!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Hurt - Watch out! It's dangerous to get hit by that attack while you're charmed!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - Please support each other while you're fighting!

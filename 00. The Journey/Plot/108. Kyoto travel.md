Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Today, I'm leaving on the class field trip.   
The train is scheduled to arrive   
in Kyoto in the afternoon.   
I hope we make some good memories.

Junpei Iori   
Kyoto, huh? That's so cliché...   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Huh? You're not a fan?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
I'd say it's a beautiful city to make some   
good memories in while we're still young.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Man, is that really the first thing you think?   
   
Junpei Iori   
It makes you sound like an old geezer   
when you say that kinda stuff.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
It does?   
   
Junpei Iori   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Thank goodness... She actually made it.

Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
We transferred to a tour bus   
after arriving at Kyoto Station.   
The sun has already set...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Higashiyama-Sanjo, Godaigo Inn...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - And here we are!   
Happy - Whoooa, nice place!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, this part of town is pretty fancy.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Hey, what's that umbrella for?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Fashion.   
In case the roof leaks.   
Wanna get under it?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Ah, I see. So, that's the style here in Kyoto, huh?   
Happy - So, which way to the geishas? You think we can ask them to put on a show?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Surprised - Huh? But this is the first floor! Guess these old Kyoto buildings have all sorts of surprises.   
Happy - So, which way to the geishas? Think we can ask them to put on a show?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Happy - I get the feeling it's for good luck, you know?   
Happy - So, which way to the geishas? Think we can ask them to put on a show?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oh, that's right, I forgot about that! Hope it's not too pricey!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Keep dreamin', Junpei.   
   
Aigis   
The stone area outside is filled with water.   
Is this one of those open-air hot springs I've heard about?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yep!   
That's the courtyard.   
Why don't you find out?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Wha— N-No, Aigis! A bath wouldn't be so out in the open like this!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - Come on, don't lie to her!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Right, this is the courtyard. Wanna go out for a walk later, Aigis?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - N-No! Aigis, you can't go in there!   
Surprised - A bath wouldn't be so out in the open like this!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - Come on, don't lie to her!   
   
Junpei Iori   
So, Ryoji. Where was your old school plannin' to go for their trip?   
Probably somewhere cool like another country, I bet. Kyoto's so typical, don't ya think?   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
Hm? Me?   
A trip... Hmm, did we even have one?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
How do you not know? That's an event most people tend to remember.   
   
Ryoji Mochizuki   
It is?   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
All right, you can all chat later. You're blocking the hallway.   
Girls, your rooms are that way. Go on and get yourselves unpacked.   
   
Junpei Iori   
You heard her.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We'll see you later, then.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Yeah, we'll see you later, Minato.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Yes, I shall see you later, Yukari-san.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - Okay, okay, enough of this!   
Angry - Aigis, you're with us! Junpei, guys' room!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Exasperated* - Maaan.   
   
Aigis   
Maaan.

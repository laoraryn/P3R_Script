Junpei Iori   
Surprised - ...!?   
   
Chidori   
Happy - I'm so glad you're awake.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Chidori...?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Huh? I thought I was...   
   
Chidori   
Happy - I guess... I was wrong.   
   
Chidori   
Happy - My fear, my heartache... I blamed it all on you, Junpei.   
Happy - I'd never felt that way before I met you.   
   
Chidori   
Happy - And for the first time in my life, I...   
Happy - I realized what I wanted.   
   
Junpei Iori   
And... what's that?   
   
Chidori   
Happy - I... want to be with you, Junpei. Forever.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - I, um, uh...   
Surprised - I-I... I wanna be with you, too.   
   
Chidori   
Sad - But it could never last... And it breaks my heart.   
Sad - We're different from you.   
Sad - Since the moment I gained my power, I've known the day I was going to die.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Huh!?   
   
Chidori   
Sad - The very thought of it horrified me.   
Sad - Up until then, I'd never once thought about death.   
Sad - But I realize now dying means I won't see you anymore.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Chidori...   
   
Chidori   
Happy - That's why... this is for the best.   
Happy - You can't die here, Junpei.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Me... Die?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Wha—!?

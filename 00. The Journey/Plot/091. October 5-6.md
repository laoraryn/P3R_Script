Principal   
No words can express the sense of loss we feel as a result of this terrible tragedy.   
He had a lifetime of opportunity ahead of him...   
As educators, we are to blame for ignoring his silent calls for help.   
We tragically lost him to senseless violence before we had a chance to help him realize his true potential...   
Forgive us... Forgive us for our negligence...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts

Upperclassman   
He just never stops talking...   
I'd never even heard of any Aragaki, had you?   
   
Other Upperclassman   
I heard he never came to school. Probably just some punk.   
Ugh, I just wanna get home. I gotta study for my mock exam.   
   
Upperclassman   
Hey, you guys know who this Aragaki is?   
Wait, you're not even in the same year. No way you'd know him then.   
Anyways, it's crazy that stuff like this really happens, huh?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I wouldn't really know.   
You're just not aware of it.   
Shut your mouth.   
   
Upperclassman   
Oh, no? Man, no one seems to know anything.   
Geez, when is this gonna end? I don't have time for this.   
   
Upperclassman   
...Huh?   
Well, whatever. I was just asking...   
   
Upperclassman   
Huh? What the hell's your problem?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Shut up...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - ......   
   
Upperclassman   
Huh? What're you getting up for?

Junpei Iori   
Very angry* - I said shut the hell up!   
   
Ms. Toriumi   
Angry - Iori, sit down!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Dammit...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Just ignore them, Junpei...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Tch...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Hey, Arisato-kun... Have you seen Sanada-senpai today?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah.   
No.   
Why?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, I meant besides at the dorm.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - He was absent this morning... I wonder if he'll show up at all.   
Sad - I hope he's okay...

Mitsuru Kirijo   
Do you have a moment?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh... Sure.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
When you get back today, let's meet in the lounge.   
Sad - I think you all know the reason...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Right...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I don't expect you to have your thoughts in order. I'm not even sure what to do myself...   
All right, I'll see you then.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - So, it's about Amada, huh...   
Sad - Well this'll be a fun meeting...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Yeah...

Akihiko Sanada   
Hey.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I had the usual for lunch...   
I was wondering what ramen tastes like when you skip class.   
It's surprisingly good... You could've invited me at least once, you know.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Come on, say something.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Why do you have to be like that?   
Always going off without saying a word.   
Put yourself in my shoes, for a change...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - ...You think it's the other way around?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - Yeah, you're right...   
Sad - I was the one always running off on my own. I was too obsessed with getting stronger...   
Sad - Ever since I lost Miki, that's all I've cared about.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - I thought if I was strong enough, I could protect anyone...   
Sad - But I was wrong... And now you're gone, too. God, it's like the world is laughing at me...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - I knew what we were getting into... I knew we were putting our lives on the line!   
Angry - But I was so focused on fighting that I didn't see anything else!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - It doesn't matter how strong I was! Look what happened!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Crying - Aaaaaahhh...!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - ...I know, Shinji.   
Sad - Crying won't change anything, right?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - I don't need you to tell me that.   
Sad - In the end, I can't run away from who I am.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - ...I've had enough of this.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The resolution in Sanada's heart has awakened a new Persona...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Sanada's Persona, **Polydeuces**, has given rise to **Caesar**!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Rest easy, Shinji. You just watch from there with Miki.   
I've still got a job to do...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...Isn't that right?   
   
---   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - You all know the reason we're gathered here.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - We need to discuss how to deal with Amada.   
Sad - I've already consulted the chairman.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Aigis, bring him here.   
   
Aigis   
Understood.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - It's my fault...   
Sad - I knew it was strange when Aragaki-senpai told me he'd be late, but I didn't say anything.   
Sad - If I'd only listened to my intuition, this wouldn't have happened...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
This isn't on you.   
......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - That's right, it's not your fault.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - No, it's not your fault.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - If there's anyone who should have realized, it's me.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - I shoulda been takin' things more seriously, too...   
Sad - I knew this wasn't a game... But I never thought it'd end up like this.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
There's no point dwelling on the past.   
Shinji's last words were, "This is how it should be."   
He was a hell of a guy... He even faced death with a smile.   
...So, from this day forward, I'll face things head-on, too.   
   
Junpei Iori   
"This is how it should be," huh...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Senpai...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ......   
   
Aigis   
Reporting in! Amada-san is not in his room!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - He's not!?   
   
Aigis   
Evidence indicates that his window has been pried open.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Amada-kun...!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Wait, Fuuka, where are you going!? Do you even know where to look?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Well... no, but... we can't just let him go off on his own, right!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - You're just gonna run around without a clue? You'll never find him like that!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - Maybe not, but we have to try!   
Very angry* - Amada-kun has nowhere else to go... I know exactly how that feels...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's go look for him.   
Calm down.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - But, where do we even look?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - ......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - He's right, Fuuka...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - But...!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
[cut 6 2 1]   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - You of all people should understand, Yukari-chan!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Fuuka...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Give him some time.   
Dragging him back won't change how he feels... And we can't protect him forever.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Akihiko...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
It's his choice. He's the only one who can decide how to live his life.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...We all choose our own paths.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ......

Ken Amada   
Sad - ......   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You look half dead.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - ......   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
What are you doing out here?   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - ......   
Sad - When Mom died protecting me, no one believed the truth...   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - To this day, they say she died in an accident that didn't even happen...   
Sad - That's why I wanted to clear the record...   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - I thought that's what she would've wanted... Maybe then she'd finally be at peace...   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - They said he died in some violent crime, right?   
Sad - No one knows the truth... Just like with Mom.   
   
Ken Amada   
Looking away - And now I'm going to be left behind, just like always...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
The dead are never coming back. You have to accept that.   
But you still have your life.   
   
Ken Amada   
Looking away - ......   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I'm not here to bring you back.   
You can waste away here, if that's what you want.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...But, if you still have the will to fight, then come back and stand on your own two feet.   
   
Ken Amada   
Looking away - ...I know that.   
   
Ken Amada   
Looking away - I've known it all along... I've just been lying to myself...   
Looking away - I needed something to hate... to keep myself going.   
   
Ken Amada   
Looking away - I couldn't face the thought of being alone...   
Looking away - But that's exactly what happened...   
   
Ken Amada   
Crying - All this time, I've just been running away...   
Crying - ......   
   
Ken Amada   
Looking away - ...All right.   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - I'm not running away...   
Angry - I'm not running away anymore... I swear it.   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - Aragaki-san... I'll see this through to the end.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The resolution in Amada's heart has awakened a new Persona...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Amada's Persona, **Nemesis**, has given rise to **Kala-Nemi**!   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Goodbye, Mom... I'll be okay now.   
   
---   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - It's already been a day...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - ...Yes, it has.   
   
Junpei Iori   
So, where's Sanada-san?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - He said to leave Amada-kun alone, but... maybe we should look for him...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What do you think?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's start looking.   
Give him time.   
I have no idea.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - You think so, too? He is still a kid...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
So, you agree with Akihiko then...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - ...I can't just sit here! I'm going right now to—   
   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Amada-kun!?   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - ......   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Oh thank goodness! I was so worried...   
   
Ken Amada   
You were?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Amada... Will you continue to fight?   
   
Ken Amada   
Yes... I'm done running away.   
   
Junpei Iori   
That okay with you?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
   
Ken Amada   
Positive.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It's all right... We can trust him.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Geez, don't scare us like that, okay?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right. I'll go and talk to the chairman.   
You should get some rest.   
   
Ken Amada   
Okay.

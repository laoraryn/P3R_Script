Junpei Iori   
Man, Chidori wasn't at the station today.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Maybe I should check again...   
Exasperated* - Nah, on second thought, I better stay put. The operation's tonight.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hm, the operation, huh...   
When it comes down to it, we're fightin' to protect her, too.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Wow, thinkin' about it like that kinda fires me up...   
Happy - Maybe we really are, like, heroes of justice...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Alright!   
   
Familiar Voice   
Don't move.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Huh?   
Surprised - Wait, that voice...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Ahhh!

Shuji Ikutsuki   
Tonight marks the sixth full moon. Have you found the Shadow?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Yes...   
It's near Paulownia Mall... I think.   
Sad - For some reason, I can't quite pinpoint its location...   
Sad - I'm trying to narrow it down though.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Is that part of its power?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Sorry, I'm not really sure about that either...   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
We have enough to go on.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Amada, did you find him?   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - No, I can't find Junpei-san anywhere.   
Sad - His backpack isn't here, so I don't think he's been home yet.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Angry - What is he doing? He knows tonight's a full moon!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm not picking up his signal anywhere near the dorm, either.   
Should I take more time to look for him, just in case?   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
No, it's okay.   
You're young. Sometimes, you just get in one of those moods.   
For now though, we need to focus our attention on the Shadow.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We can't afford to waste any more time. We need to get moving.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Let's go!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Hold up... Did Junpei say anything about this?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Not that I remember.   
Maybe he needs a break.   
Why, are you worried?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Alright, then.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Hm, maybe...   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Who knows...?   
   
   
---   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Any luck?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Looking away - I only sense a faint presence. It seems so close, but... I can't reach it...!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right, we can split up and search for it. There's no time to lose, so let's hurry!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - Wait!   
Very angry* - Please, I can do it! This is what I'm here for!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Looking away - ......   
Looking away - Feel the movement of the earth through your fingertips...   
Looking away - Hear the answer of the wind flow through your hair...   
Looking away - Taste the knowledge of the water on your lips...   
Looking away - Tell me, Lucia... What shrouds me from the truth?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Hey, is she okay...?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Don't break her concentration.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Looking away - This is...   
Sad - Some kind of... web... beneath us?   
   
Aigis   
A web...? Perhaps it's related to the old power cables underground.   
Back when the island was still being developed, this is where the main power station was located.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Underground cables...?   
   
Aigis   
Yes, a large number of power cables remain underground in a sprawling network, much like a web.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
So that's what's interfering with her ability?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Thank you, Aigis. I've figured it out now.   
Angry - It's not that the cables are interfering...   
Angry - ...The cables themselves have been possessed by the Shadow!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - They what...!?   
Surprised - So, everything under our feet is part of the Shadow!?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
No wonder you couldn't pinpoint it. It's covering this entire area.   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - H-How are we supposed to beat something like that!?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Tch... Hiding underground, huh...   
   
   
---   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Ow...   
   
Familiar Voice   
I can't believe how easy it was to sneak up on you. Is the rest of your team this oblivious?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Dammit... I can't fight back like this...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - This isn't funny...   
Angry - Chidori...   
   
Chidori   
I want you to do something for me.   
I have orders for you to pass along to your team.   
You can at least communicate with them, can't you?   
   
Junpei Iori   
My team...? Orders...?   
   
Chidori   
Do as I say, and you won't be harmed.   
   
Chidori   
All you have to do is call off your operation. Easy, right?   
And not just the one tonight... All of them.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - You want me to cancel the operation...?   
Surprised - No way... You're not one of "them," are you?   
   
Chidori   
Angry - Quit wasting time.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - ......   
   
   
---   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - So, the Shadow controls a whole underground network...?   
Sad - This is a problem. We have no means of attack.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Your notes from previous battles mentioned a Shadow that was able to take control of the monorail.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm guessing this Shadow must have its own body, just like that one.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - Let me see if I can pinpoint it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Closed eyes, concentrating - ......   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Fuuka...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Even if we know where it is, we still have to get to it...   
   
Aigis   
If it's abandoned, there may still be a way to enter the facility where the cables converge.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
We'll see...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Ah... Hah... I found it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - It's here... in the mall!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - In here!?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - It's inside a small chamber underground.   
Sad - It's rectangular, so I assume it's man-made.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Is it some sort of basement?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Wait a minute...   
I overheard the manager of Escapade a while back...   
He was sayin' the power supply's been acting up lately.   
There was a big outage because of it that forced him to cancel some important event.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
An outage?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Yeah. Mentioned they remodeled the basement into a control room a while ago.   
Maybe we should take a look...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - That's got to be it!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Good job, Yamagishi.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - All right. As soon as we're ready, we'll make our move!   
   
   
---   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Very angry* - That's the Shadow's core!   
Very angry* - The cables are feeding into its body, so it might use electricity to attack!   
Very angry* - Please, be careful!   
   
   
---   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I can't sense it anymore! Nice work, everyone.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, by the way...   
I think I sensed Junpei-kun earlier.   
Sad - He's back at the dorm, but something felt off...   
Sad - The chairman's there too, so he should be okay, but... we should hurry back, just in case.   
   
   
---   
   
Chidori   
...It looks like they've completed their operation.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - What? You can tell!?   
   
Chidori   
I see it... through Medea's eyes.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Medea?   
   
Chidori   
My... friend.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Chidori...   
   
Chidori   
Angry - That's not important. Why didn't you call off the operation?   
Angry - Is your mission worth your life?   
Angry - Dying is what people fear the most...   
Angry - Is it not?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Well... I've never actually given anyone orders before.   
Sad - They wouldn't listen to me, even if I tried...   
Sad - Y'see, uh... I'm not really the one in charge...   
   
Chidori   
Sad - So, you were lying earlier?   
Sad - Why...?   
Sad - I don't understand.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Hey... Can you tell me one thing? Was it all... just an act?   
   
Chidori   
...?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - The way we met at the station, that cut on your hand, the drawings... Were you just setting me up?   
Sad - Now that I think about it, a real cut wouldn't have disappeared that fast...   
Sad - Haha... I see how it is...   
   
Chidori   
Sad - That was—   
   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Junpei!?   
   
Chidori   
Angry - They're back already!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - An Evoker!? She's a Persona-user!?   
   
Chidori   
Medea, come...   
   
Chidori   
[cut 3 2 0]   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Chidori, no!   
   
Chidori   
Hurt - Ahhh!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Senpai, her Evoker!   
   
Chidori   
Very angry* - No! Give it back!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Sorry, but we can't let you use this.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Surprised - What's all the fuss ab— Wha!? When did she—!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Aigis, restrain her.   
   
Aigis   
Understood.   
   
Chidori   
Very angry* - Medea!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - I... I didn't even sense her until now... This is the only thing I can do, and yet...   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
Even we couldn't sense her... She must have the ability to conceal her presence...   
Exasperated* - I certainly didn't have the slightest clue she was here...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I have a number of questions for you. Are you a member of that group called Strega?   
   
Chidori   
Sad - ...I'm not... afraid... of dying...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Ch-Chidori...!?   
   
Chidori   
Sad - ...M-Medea... I'm...   
Sad - ......   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sad - It looks like she's too emotionally unstable for an interrogation.   
Sad - Let's check in on her later, after she's had some time to calm down.   
   
Shuji Ikutsuki   
I'll go ahead and arrange a hospital room for her. She'll have to be placed under watch, but I'm sure she understands.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Chidori...   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
We succeeded in defeating   
the Shadow this month, too.   
There should be fewer victims for a while.   
But a new adversary has emerged...   
What will happen now...?   
......   
I'm exhausted... I should get some rest.

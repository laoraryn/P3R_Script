Mitsuru Kirijo   
Good job. You did well handling a strong opponent.   
I'm feeling confident in your ability to lead. How do you feel?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Perfect.   
I'm not sure...   
I'm feeling okay.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Well, you're sounding quite confident yourself. Keep it up.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Don't worry, you're doing just fine. All you need is more experience.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Well, I can see your potential. I'm looking forward to seeing what you can do.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right, time to resume exploration. Let me know if you need something.   
   
-----   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Great work. The path ahead is now accessible.   
We can stop here for the day, if you want. What do you think?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's go home, then.   
Let's keep going.   
Why don't you decide?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right. You can use the teleporter nearby to return to the entrance.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Roger that. Then I'll continue providing support as you go on.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - As the leader, it's your decision what to do in the field.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'll leave it to you.   
   
-----   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
A battle well fought.   
Do you want to continue the exploration today? How do you feel?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I think we can keep going.   
Let's head back for today.   
I guess if you want to...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right. Let's resume after you catch your breath. I'll continue backing you up.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Very well, then return to the entrance. It's good not to push yourselves.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Oh, I'm not forcing you. You should decide based on the current situation.   
   
-----   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Excellent victory!   
It seems you've gotten the hang of fighting here.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure have.   
Not really...   
But I won't drop my guard.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Indeed. I'm impressed. You might even get by without my support.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - *chuckle* Is that you being humble? You never fail to surprise me.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm glad to hear it. We can never be sure what will happen in here.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hm... I must say, when I see all of you in action, it makes me want to join in too...   
...Never mind. Please continue exploring.   
   
-----   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - I can't believe you managed victory all on your own! I must commend you.   
Happy - Whatever your goal was in fighting alone... it was quite a spectacle indeed.   
However, I would personally prefer if you took someone along with you.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's probably a good idea.   
That's not necessary.   
I'll think about it.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Yes, there's no reason to take the risk of going alone.   
Everyone else is ready. Come back to the entrance if you want to form a party.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Exasperated* - I see... Well, you are the leader in the field, so I won't question your tactics.   
But while I trust in your abilities, make sure you're being careful at all times.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The decision is yours, but it's important for the others to gain experience, too.   
If you want anyone to join you, come back to the entrance and form a party.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right, I'll be counting on you.   
   
-----   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The enemy has been defeated. Great work, everyone!   
Leader, your direction was amazing!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, it went well.   
I'm not so sure about that...   
It's all thanks to you, Fuuka.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Yes, I knew I didn't have to worry. You did a great job, Arisato-kun.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh, really? Well, I think you did very well.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Wh-What? I don't... Um... Well, I'm glad if I was able to help you...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Anyway, there's a staircase up ahead. Keep it up!   
   
-----   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Great job, everyone.   
This could be a good place to stop. Do you want to return for the day?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, let's do that.   
No, we're just getting started!   
You're being very cautious.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Okay, see you at the entrance.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, I see. Okay, I'll continue supporting you, then.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Well, you never know what will happen, so I think it's good to be careful...   
But it's up to you, Leader. Just don't push yourself too hard, okay?   
   
-----   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The enemy has been defeated! Thanks for your hard work, everyone.   
If you're feeling up to it, how about exploring for a little more?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's the plan.   
I want to return for now.   
I'm not sure yet.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Okay! The stairs that lead to the next floor are right up ahead!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
All right. Be careful on your way down.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - It's a tough decision... Pulling back for now is definitely an option as well.   
Happy - Well, we'll do whatever you decide we should do, Arisato-kun.   
   
-----   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - The enemy has been defeated! How is everyone doing?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um... Sorry if it's weird to bring this up right now, but...   
I really respect you all for fighting on the front line, despite the danger.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
We're used to it.   
It's rough.   
Do you want to try?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh, is that so? Well, even still, I think it's amazing.   
Happy - Now that I think about it, I guess even I am more calm now than I was at first...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Yeah... Even just one wrong move could lead to something terrible...   
But I'll be sure to keep supporting you so nothing like that ever happens.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Sometimes, I wish I could... But I don't think that's very realistic for me...   
So, instead, I'll do whatever I can to keep you all safe on your journey.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh, um... Anyway, I just wanted to say that I'm really thankful to everyone.   
Happy - Let's all keep doing our best!   
   
-----   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Wow... I can't believe you managed to win all by yourself!   
Happy - Everyone else is shocked, too. Do you plan to keep going alone?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'll go as far as I can.   
I'm pretty worn out...   
I'll decide in a bit.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - All right. Honestly, I'm a little worried about you being on your own there...   
Happy - But I'm also excited to see what else you're capable of. Just please be careful.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh, then please come back immediately! You'll be safer with a full party.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Okay. I'm sure you'd be fine, but please don't push yourself either.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Everyone here is cheering you on and ready to join you if you need them.   
Happy - Good luck!

Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Hey, nice work out there, Arisato-kun. You're seriously leader material.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Naturally.   
I just got lucky.   
Wanna give it a try?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Haha, well, aren't you oozing with confidence? But honestly, that's a reassuring trait to see in a leader.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Yeah? Well, you know what they say: luck is just another word for skill.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Who, me? Uh, yeah, no thanks. I'd be in way over my head.   
Exasperated* - Unlike you, I'd just drop the ball when push comes to shove. I lose my cool way too easily.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Anyway, should we get going? After you, Leader.   
   
-----   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Nice work. These Gatekeeper guys are super tough, huh?   
Might be time to call it a day. What do you think?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, let's head back.   
I'm just getting started.   
Do you wanna head back?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Cool! Let's head to the entrance.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Well, someone's motivated. Okay, let's see how far we can get, then.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Oh, no, that's not what I meant. I'm not tired. I just figured this might be a good stopping point.   
But I'm sure you have this expedition all planned out, so it's your call.   
   
-----   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Whew, now we can get through.   
We're on a roll, but what do you think, Arisato-kun? Wanna keep going?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, let's keep it up.   
Let's stop here.   
You sound motivated.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - You got it! You think we'll make it to the next Gatekeeper?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Oh, are you tired? These Gatekeepers sure are a handful, aren't they?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Well, yeah, I guess so... But that makes me sound like I'm usually not.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Anyway, you ready to go?   
   
-----   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Not too long ago, I don't think we would've stood a chance against an enemy that tough.   
Don't you think we've gotten even stronger...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Of course.   
There's room to improve.   
Don't get carried away.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Haha, thanks for the vote of confidence. That's real encouraging, coming from you.   
Happy - When we first started out, it took everything I had just to summon my Persona.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Geez, would it kill you to compliment a girl every once in a while?   
Happy - Kiiidding. Honestly, I prefer constructive criticism.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, of course. We're not the only ones getting stronger.   
Exasperated* - I won't let it go to my head, unlike a certain someone we both know.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Okay, let's keep moving. On to the next?   
   
-----   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Phew... We won. Feels like I'm at the top of my game today.   
Maybe it's because my horoscope said that Libras are supposed to be really lucky today?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, I think so.   
That's unrelated.   
I'll read your palm, too.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Haha, so you're the type to buy into superstitions? I totally get it. Like, you're skeptical, but they'll stay at the back of your mind.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Yeah, I'm with you there. If only things were that simple...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Really? I never took you as the type to be interested in—   
   
Angry - Hey... Is this some kinda ploy where you try to hold my hand?   
Exasperated* - Oh, who am I kidding...? You're no Junpei.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Well, they say luck is a skill, right? So it wouldn't hurt to believe in good omens...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Wait... Has the date changed already?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Do horoscopes change during the Dark Hour!? Ugh... The curiosity is killing me.   
   
-----   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Awww yeah, who's da man!?   
Happy - I guess you weren't too shabby either. Keep up the good work, bud.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Oh, gee. Thanks.   
Someone's on an ego trip.   
Same goes for you, man.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Remember, my dude, in times like these, teamwork is key.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Haha, I'm just tryin' to hype you up, man. Don't worry, you're still the one callin' the shots.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Hey, man, I got your back, so let's keep sharing the load.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Alright, let's roll!   
   
-----   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Phew... These guys are a serious workout compared to your average Shadow.   
Sad - I mean, I've still got gas in the tank, but how 'bout we make a quick pitstop?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, let's go back.   
Not right now.   
You sure you're not tired?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Heheh, gotta know when to cash in your chips, am I right?   
Happy - C'mon, I'll race ya to the nearest teleporter. On your marks... Get set... GO!!!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Whaaat? For reals? Well, aren't you an overachiever.   
Sad - Whatever. I'll keep you company, dude.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Whoa there, h-hold up... I was worried YOU were running on empty, not me.   
Sad - But if you're gonna keep going, I got your back. Just don't push it, alright?   
   
-----   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Aaand that's a wrap, folks.   
Happy - Damn, look at us go. Nothing can stop us now! Execution Squad, move out!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's get going.   
Let's turn back.   
All the way to the top.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Glad to see you brought your A game. Between you and me, we've got the next fight in the bag.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Hold up... You're seriously calling it quits?   
Happy - Welp, I guess this is as good a time as any for an intermission. The second half of the Junpei Spectacular can always wait for next time.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Ambitious, ain'tcha? Not that I got a problem with that!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Alright, let's bounce.   
   
-----   
   
Junpei Iori   
Is it just me, or are these Shadows upping their game? How much stronger are they gonna get?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I don't wanna know.   
No clue.   
We just gotta up our game, too.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - For real. Maybe they don't even have a limit, but we just gotta bust through 'em.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Well, we can forget about things getting easier down the line...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Yeah, sure, but that's easier said than done, y'know?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - And, hey, don't get me wrong. I ain't scared of 'em or anything, alright?   
Angry - Heck, I'm hashin' out big plans to finish 'em off in style as we speak...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Yo, what's with that look? You don't believe me?   
   
-----   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Whew... Man, we totally crushed it.   
Scheming - In baseball terms, you could say the team ace, Iori, pitched a complete game and totally shut out the opponent.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I don't get it.   
This isn't baseball.   
But I'm the ace.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Okay, let me put it this way: I was the cleanup hitter, and I hit the ball outta the park to score us that huge win.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - 'Course it's not! Ever heard of an analogy?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Ooh, look at you, talkin' big. But there's enough room in the Hall of Fame for the two of us.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Anyway, the bottom line is that you need a team with powerful batters and a strong bullpen in order to—   
   
Surprised - Wait, what were we talkin' about again?   
   
-----   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Good going, Arisato!   
Your directions were on point, and you managed to keep your cool against a tough opponent.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You bet I did.   
Not necessarily.   
It was rough.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Heh, all right, hotshot. I see we're in good hands.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Haha, so you wore a poker face the whole time? That's brilliant.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - What, being humble in front of your senpai?   
Just remember, seniority means nothing on the battlefield, so don't hold back.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All right, time to move on. Stay sharp.   
   
-----   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Great. Now we'll be able to move on.   
There's always the option to turn back, too. What's your call, Arisato?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's head back.   
Let's keep going.   
Let me think about it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Got it. Let's regroup for now.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Gotcha. We'll take things at your pace.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
No worries, go ahead. Take your time to assess the situation—there's no need to rush.   
   
-----   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Great, the path is clear.   
Scheming - So what's the plan? I'm down to knock out the next Gatekeeper if you want.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's go for it.   
I don't know about that...   
Let me think about it.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Scheming - That's the spirit. I'm willing to stick it out for the long haul if you are.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Why? What's up? You tired?   
Happy - It's fine. There's no reason you should have to force yourself to press forward. Our opponents aren't going anywhere.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Sure, go for it. I'm still good to go.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
All right, let's get moving. We're counting on you.   
   
-----   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - That last opponent sure packed a punch. It made for a good fight.   
The tougher the opponent, the more pumped up you get. Don't you agree?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, I get you.   
I prefer them weaker.   
Depends on the situation.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Scheming - Glad we see eye-to-eye. After all, the only way to get stronger is by pushing your limits.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Really? Hm... I guess taking care of those weaker opponents could be good training.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Fair point. You won't glean much from fighting an opponent way out of your league.   
But sometimes, facing off against a heavyweight might get you to the next level.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Now then... Care to find out what's waiting for us up ahead?   
   
-----   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
No matter how many times I see you fight, I still can't believe my eyes.   
Just how on earth are you swapping your Personas out at will?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I was surprised at first, too.   
I hear it's rare.   
Want me to lend you one?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
You say that, but you've taken to it like a fish to water. You know, I think there's something special about you.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
I suppose you are kind of an oddball, in a manner of speaking.   
But you can't be the only one... I'm sure someone else out there has the same ability as you.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Haha, I appreciate the offer, but I already have my hands full training with the one I've got.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
At any rate, having you around has opened us up to more battle strategies, so let's keep capitalizing on that.   
   
-----   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Excellent—a perfect victory. All thanks to your precise orders, Arisato.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That went well.   
I'm just getting started.   
This is exhausting.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - I'm sure it's tough to lead the team, but evidently, you're quite up to the task.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - I admire your tenacity. That kind of drive will lead to further growth.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Indeed it is. Fulfilling the role of a leader requires both mind and matter.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Of course, I'll try to help out wherever I can. That said, please don't act recklessly.   
Now then, let's get back to business.   
   
-----   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Somehow, we pulled through. Those Gatekeepers are truly a cut above the rest.   
This would be an ideal time to regroup, but what say you?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's head back.   
I'd like to keep going.   
I'm not sure.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Fine by me. It's best to be prepared for all possible contingencies.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - I take it you want to ride the momentum to seize our next victory? Very well. I'll leave it to your discretion.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Fair enough. There's no rule of thumb for when to retreat.   
Happy - Whatever you choose, I'll stand by your decision. Lead on.   
   
-----   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Now then, the path is clear. Shall we proceed?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Of course.   
Let's head back.   
If you're able to.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - You seem to be in fine form tonight. Very well, let's get back to work.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right. Then let's make for the entrance.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Of course. That's no problem at all.   
I can rest easy with you at the reins. Keep up the good work.   
   
-----   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
How many Gatekeepers does that make? They're becoming more ferocious by the minute, aren't they?   
It's likely you'll face greater tactical challenges moving forward, but I trust you'll be fine.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Leave it to me.   
I don't know...   
Not much of a choice.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Needless to say, we'll do our utmost to support you.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Well, I know you can handle it. Don't doubt yourself, just keep doing what you've been doing.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - I'm afraid not, but trust me, you're more than capable. And I'll support you as best I can.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Shall we keep going, then?   
   
-----   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We'll be able to progress now, but... how high do you suppose this tower is?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
No idea.   
We might be near the top.   
No use dwelling on it.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I believe we still have a long road ahead of us, but part of our job is to find out for certain.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I wish that was true, but from the looks of things, we've still a ways to go.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That's true. But one thing we can be certain of is that, come what may, we will eventually reach our goal.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...I'm not losing my nerve, of course, mind you.   
Having made it this far is a remarkable feat in itself.   
For now, let's keep paving a path forward.   
   
-----   
   
Aigis   
Enemy Shadow annihilated. You possess superlative decision-making skills, Minato-san.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That went well.   
It was just luck.   
You did great, Aigis.   
   
Aigis   
Yes, learning that team coordination is equally as important as individual strengths has proved insightful.   
   
Aigis   
The odds of an operation being streamlined by chance is astronomically low. I suspect you are being modest, as per usual.   
   
Aigis   
Thank you. That battle was "easy-peasy lemon squeezy," as they say.   
   
Aigis   
Now, let us resume our exploration.   
   
-----   
   
Aigis   
High-level threat eliminated. How is everyone's current condition?   
If you are experiencing fatigue, then I recommend we return early.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's head back for tonight.   
I can keep going.   
Doesn't matter to me.   
   
Aigis   
Understood. Then let us return to the entrance.   
   
Aigis   
That is very "magnifique," as they say. Then let us resume our exploration.   
   
Aigis   
This is the time to be decisive. As such, you must make the final call, Minato-san.   
Whatever you decide, I shall be at your side.   
   
-----   
   
Aigis   
Gatekeeper Shadow eliminated. While this may be a good stopping point...   
Should we press forward instead?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure.   
I wanna go home.   
You're raring to go.   
   
Aigis   
Understood. In that case, let us "roll n' rock," as they say.   
   
Aigis   
I see. Very well. Let us return and recuperate in preparation for our next battle.   
   
Aigis   
Of course. This is my mission, after all.   
Well then, Minato-san, shall we?   
   
-----   
   
Aigis   
Threat eliminated. Mission complete.   
Which reminds me: have you adjusted to Shifting and using Theurgy in battle?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
To a certain extent.   
I haven't needed them.   
It's like second nature.   
   
Aigis   
Both are useful in battle. It would be for the best if you were to utilize them more efficiently.   
   
Aigis   
I see. In other words, you have yet to utilize them in battle.   
Is this what they call "saving the best for last"? Your potential truly is limitless.   
   
Aigis   
I expected nothing less from Minato-san. Your mastery of tactics is second to none.   
   
Aigis   
I will also fight without restraining my power. The upcoming battles will surely test our strength.   
   
-----   
   
Aigis   
Cleanup operation, complete. Enemies of this caliber are like sitting kappa.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You got that right.   
Not really.   
...Why "kappa"?   
   
Aigis   
Oh, good. Perhaps the kappa will be happy for us as well.   
   
Aigis   
Right, they were not sitting, were they? I should have said they were like "standing kappa" instead. Idioms are difficult.   
   
Aigis   
I was informed it is an idiom that describes an easy or defenseless target.   
   
Aigis   
By the way... what manner of creature is Mr. Kappa? I would like to meet him one day.   
   
-----   
   
Aigis   
Enemy Shadow eliminated. That was a well-orchestrated attack, Minato-san.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That went well.   
It was just luck.   
You did great, Aigis.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Yes, a well-coordinated team is essential to achieving victory, isn't it?   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Hehe, you're always so modest, Minato-san.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Thank you. I just want to do what I can to best fulfill my role.   
   
Aigis   
Now then, let's resume our exploration.   
   
-----   
   
Aigis   
Mission accomplished. Is anyone hurt?   
If you feel tired, please don't push yourself too hard and head back instead.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's turn back for now.   
I can keep going.   
You're very composed.   
   
Aigis   
Understood. Let's make for the first floor.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Roger that! We want to ride this momentum, correct?   
   
Aigis   
Happy - They do say, "Haste makes waste." It's all right to take your time to weigh all your options.   
The decision is yours, Minato-san. I trust you.   
   
-----   
   
Aigis   
Great job, everyone. Now, we could stop here...   
But I think we can keep going. What do you think?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sounds like a plan.   
I wanna go home.   
You're raring to go.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Yes! Let's rock n' roll, then!   
   
Aigis   
Understood. Then let's head back to the entrance.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Of course! I want to do all that I can, fighting alongside everyone else.   
Please lead on, Minato-san.   
   
-----   
   
Aigis   
Well done.   
Whether Shift or Theurgy, you're proficient in every tactic at your disposal now, aren't you?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
To a certain extent.   
It's like second nature.   
I'm not sure.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - You're not one to brag, are you, Minato-san? Hehe, we're fortunate to have you.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Hehe, we're fortunate to have you.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - You've made it this far, so I think you're allowed to be confident in yourself. Don't you?   
   
Aigis   
Happy - I'll also prepare myself for our final battle.   
   
-----   
   
Aigis   
We took them down easily. They were practically sitting kappa.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You got that right.   
Not really.   
...Why "kappa"?   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Hehe, no offense to Mr. Kappa, but the expression is a bit amusing, isn't it?   
   
Aigis   
Sad - Oh? Should I have said "standing kappa" instead...? Idioms are difficult.   
   
Aigis   
Happy - Junpei-san taught me that idiom. It describes an easy or defenseless target.   
   
Aigis   
By the way... what kind of creature is Mr. Kappa? I'd love to meet him one day.   
   
-----   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Nice! We took out a tough enemy.   
Happy - That win was all thanks to your instructions, Arisato-san!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Naturally.   
Not quite.   
It was all you.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - It was really impressive.   
Happy - The leader has to issue precise orders for the team to function properly.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Haha, well, of course everyone contributes by combining all our individual strengths as well.   
Happy - But the leader is the one who puts all the pieces together. And you're good at it, too.   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - Really? I'm happy you think so, but...   
Happy - I think I'm a lot stronger fighting alongside everyone.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Oh, sorry. That kinda came out of nowhere.   
Happy - It's just that I've always felt this way, so I wanted to tell you myself.   
Happy - Anyway, let's keep this up.   
   
   
-----   
   
   
Ken Amada   
Phew, these Gatekeepers are a lot tougher than the typical Shadow wandering around.   
Should we keep going? Or is it time we take a break?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's turn back.   
Let's move on.   
I'm on the fence.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Good idea. Let's head back to the entrance, then.   
   
Ken Amada   
I see... You're a man of steel, aren't you, Arisato-san?   
Happy - Oh, but I'm also good to go! Let's see how far we can get.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - This is a good stopping point, so it's hard to decide, huh?   
Happy - Well, just let me know when you've made up your mind. I'm fine either way.   
   
-----   
   
Ken Amada   
...I think I had a small breakthrough during that last fight.   
Is it okay if we keep going? I'd like to reinforce what I picked up while it's still fresh.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Sure, let's do it.   
Let's head back first.   
I'll think about it.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Thank you. I'll do my best to make myself useful.   
   
Ken Amada   
Oh, are you tired?   
Happy - Okay, that's fine. We can just pick up from here next time.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - I trust your decision, but if we can carry on, then let's.   
   
-----   
   
Ken Amada   
How many Gatekeeper Shadows do you think there are total?   
Sad - They keep getting tougher, which means there could be some really strong ones waiting for us up ahead.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, probably.   
I hope that was the last of them.   
No point dwelling on it.   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - If that's the case... then I'll be ready.   
   
Ken Amada   
If only... That'd be nice, but in the end, it's just wishful thinking.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - That's true. We should just focus on the enemies in front of us.   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - I need to train harder so that I can be ready to face any foe, no matter how strong they might be.   
Happy - Okay, let's move on.   
   
-----   
   
Ken Amada   
Phew, there we go. Glad that's over.   
These Gatekeepers sure are tough. Imagine if every enemy on a floor was a Gatekeeper.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, let's not.   
It'd be good experience.   
We'd just steamroll them.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Haha, I know I'm the one who brought it up, but thinking about it sent a shiver down my spine.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Yeah, it'd definitely keep us on our toes... Then again, we're always on edge.   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - Huh? You really think so!? Arisato-san, you sound super confident!   
Sad - Meanwhile, I'm getting chills just picturing it.   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - There's no knowing what kind of tricks they have up their sleeve. Let's stay alert.   
   
-----   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru seems happy we won.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Good boy.   
I'll give you a treat later, okay?   
Keep up the good work.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru looks proud of himself.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
-----   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant*   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru seems to be panting heavily.   
Did that last battle wear him out?   
   
Koromaru   
*whine*   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's turn back.   
Let's go a little further.   
Let me assess the situation.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru seems to be on board.   
Heading back is probably the right idea...   
   
Koromaru   
...Arf! Arf, arf!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Looks like Koromaru is psyching himself up.   
He seems willing to go the extra mile...   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru seems to be on board.   
It's up to me to decide whether   
we forge ahead or pull back...   
   
-----   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Awoooooo!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru is in a good mood.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Want to keep going?   
Let's head back.   
We're on a roll, yeah?   
   
Koromaru   
Woof!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru seems determined.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru seems to be on board.   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Arf! Arf!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Koromaru seems determined.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
-----   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Nice work. You too, Koro-chan.   
Since the enemies are getting stronger, we'll need to be even more cautious moving forward.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
We'll be fine.   
I'm a little nervous.   
You got this, Koromaru.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Heehee, are you feeling confident too, Koro-chan? Looks like there's courage aplenty here.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Koro-chan's cheering you on. He's got your back!   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Heehee, looks like someone's full of spirit. We'll be counting on you, Koro-chan.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
-----   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The Gatekeeper has been defeated! Thanks for all your hard work, everyone.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I know I'm just stating the obvious here, but Koro-chan sure is amazing, isn't he?   
He's so cooperative and a great team-player. It's almost like he understands everything we say.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Because he's a smart boy.   
Maybe it's your imagination?   
Atta boy, Koromaru.   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Heehee, Koro-chan looks so happy. See? He does understand.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - N-No, it can't be. You understand us, don't you, Koro-chan?   
   
Koromaru   
Sad - *whine*   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - See? Look how sad he is. I'm sure he understands what we're saying.   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Arf, arf!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Heehee, Koro-chan looks so happy. See? He does understand.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Keep up the good work, Koro-chan!   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
-----   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Looks like we're done here...   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
You're better than I thought. I can see why Aki hyped you up.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Thanks, I guess.   
That was no big deal.   
You're no pushover yourself.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
I got your back, so do what you gotta do.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Heh, best to stay humble. Pride's just gonna get you killed.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...Well, yeah. I can't afford to be holding back either.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Let's get going.   
   
-----   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
There goes that pain in the neck.   
Want to call it here?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, let's leave.   
I'd rather keep going.   
What should we do?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Smart. Head back and rest or whatever to get ready for the next trip.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Gotcha. Well, you're the leader. I'll just stick with you.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Up to you. Just don't bite off more than you can chew.   
   
-----   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Alright, path looks clear.   
We're gonna keep goin', right?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, of course.   
Maybe we should go back...   
You seem fired up.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Happy - Heh, glad we're on the same page. I've got plenty of fuel to burn myself.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
That's fine. This ain't a bad stopping point either.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...Nah, I'm just checkin' with you.   
'Course, I ain't feelin' too bad myself.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Let's go.   
   
-----   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Stubborn bastard, wasn't it? No match for us, though.   
There are gonna be even tougher fights down the road, so be ready for that.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You can count on me.   
I can take 'em.   
I'll leave it to you.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Don't mean to put you on the spot or anything, but our victory's ridin' on you.   
Let's see you get it done, Leader.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Happy - Hmph, you got nerve, I'll give you that.   
A little bravado's fine, but don't get too cocky or it'll bite you in the ass.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
......   
Hey, don't go passing the baton to me. There's no guarantee I'll always be around, you know.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Alright, let's get going.   
   
-----   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...Glad that's over.   
Don't go wastin' your time on these kinda enemies.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's kick it into gear.   
No need to be hasty.   
You feeling burned out?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Be my guest.   
I dunno how big this place is, but can't hurt to try and make some progress.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
...Fair.   
But can't hurt to try and make some progress either, especially when I'm in the mood.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
What, would you tell me off if I were? I ain't made of glass, so worry about yourself.   
I'll do my job, and I'll do it damn well. So rest easy and do yours.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
C'mon, let's move out.   
   
-----   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Hmmm...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - What's wrong, Junpei-kun? Something on your mind?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Nah, it's nothing, just... You know those Shadows with books on their heads?   
Like the one we fought just now? What's even written inside that book?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh, I was wondering the same thing...   
We'll catch glimpses from time to time, but it's hard to tell while fighting.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Right? I mean, I don't give a crap about the words...   
Happy - But if there are photo collections of pretty models, like in manga magazines, then...   
   
-----   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Have you ever wondered how those scale-shaped Shadows stand upright?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Ah, the balance types. I imagine they'd struggle with standing upright and moving around.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Do you suppose there's a reason they look the way they do?   
Moreover... I'm actually quite tempted to tip them over.   
...Apologies, I digress.   
Let's move along, Leader.   
   
-----   
   
Aigis   
Enemy defeated. Requesting our next directive.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's keep exploring.   
Let's turn back for today.   
What would you like to do?   
   
Aigis   
Affirmative. Though Tartarus may be a colossal tower...   
With constant, incremental progress, we will gradually reach our objective.   
A journey of a thousand miles begins by first treading without fear, as they say.   
   
Aigis   
Understood. Better safe than sorry, as they say.   
They also say, "Haste makes waste," and, "Slow and steady wins the race."   
Though... is it not more optimal to be fast and steady instead?   
   
Aigis   
...I had not anticipated a query in response to my query.   
Is this what they call "getting blindsided"?   
But I do not have any blind side to speak of, so does this not apply to me?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - A-Aigis, you sure know some unusual phrases. Where did you learn about them?   
   
Aigis   
I have a daily academic regimen.   
Just the other day, Junpei-san taught me how to write haikus.   
"Oh my Tartarus... Dark, decrepit Tartarus... Why are you so tall?"   
   
-----   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Great. Now we'll be able to progress.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
What do you think, Arisato? Any concerns moving forward?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
None at all.   
Just a few.   
Should I be concerned?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That confidence of yours sure is reassuring. I'm sure everyone else on the team thinks so, too.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Keep it up. I'll back you up in any way I can.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Ah... I understand where you're coming from.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
But you're doing great. Don't panic, keep moving forward, and you'll be fine.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Well, we've been on the front lines for some time now...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
So I just wanted to remind you to reach out if you ever need anything.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sanada-senpai...   
Happy - You seem... calmer than before. It's a really welcome change.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Heh, you just had to add that last bit. A "welcome change," huh?   
Happy - Anyway, let's get going. We still have a long road ahead of us.   
   
-----   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
How does it feel to be back in action, Amada-kun?   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Great, actually. Thanks for asking, Fuuka-san.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - I'd like to thank you as well, Arisato-san—for letting me on the front lines.   
Angry - I want to get even stronger so I can help make things easier on everyone else.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Looking forward to it.   
You're plenty strong already.   
We'll help you out, too.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Just watch me. I promise I'll follow through.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Haha, I don't need any spoiling, you know? Besides, I'm a growing boy.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Thank you, I appreciate it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - By the way, Amada-kun... I caught a glimpse of you from behind just now.   
Happy - I think you might have gotten taller.   
   
Ken Amada   
Surprised - Really!?   
Happy - Maybe it's because of all the milk I drink, hehe.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Okay, Arisato-san. Shall we get going?   
   
-----   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Enemy Shadow eliminated.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Way to go, everyone. Let's keep it up, and—   
   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh, hold that thought, Yukari-chan...   
Are those... blisters on your hands?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Wha— How could you tell!?   
Yeah... They're just a little bit blistered. I can still shoot just fine, though.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Nice catch, Fuuka.   
Don't push yourself, Yukari.   
Shall we take a break?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um... I just noticed you seemed a little different from usual.   
Happy - I have bandages and other first aid stuff, so let me know if you need anything, okay, Yukari-chan?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I agree. Fortunately, it doesn't seem too bad right now.   
Happy - But I can wrap your hands with some bandages if the blisters are bothering you.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I think we should. Fortunately, it doesn't seem too bad right now.   
Happy - But if you do take a break, I'll keep an eye on the perimeter for you.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Gotcha. Thanks, Fuuka.   
......   
I get this feeling you've been looking out for us more than usual lately.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - R-Really? I'm glad I could at least do that much.   
Happy - After all, my role here is to support everyone.   
Happy - Well, shall we get going, Leader?   
   
-----   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Great. Now we can keep moving.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Even though the "theory" about defeating the Shadows that appear during a full moon was just a trick...   
I'm sure there's something here that can help us get rid of the Dark Hour.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I think so, too.   
What if there's nothing?   
Only one way to find out.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Honestly, I'd be surprised if there wasn't anything at all...   
At this point, all we can do is find out for ourselves—especially since this is a job only we can do.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Haha, that'd seriously suck. But even if we swing and miss, it's not like we have anything to lose, right?   
If there's nothing at all, then we've eliminated one possibility. That means we just have to start looking somewhere else.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Haha, I'm glad you're so motivated, Arisato-kun.   
It's definitely best to get as far as we can rather than sitting around, mulling over hypotheticals.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It's incredible how you always find a silver lining, Yukari-chan.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Honestly, half of it is probably just me putting up a front, but the other half is thanks to you, Fuuka.   
Thank you for giving me that recording.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Yukari-chan...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
All right! Time to get going! Lead the way, Arisato-kun.   
   
-----   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Everyone, line up! Since we're on a roll, how 'bout we put the pedal to the metal?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You're on fire.   
Let's take it slow.   
Let's turn back.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Damn right I am. Figured just mopin' around wasn't gonna get me anywhere.   
   
Junpei Iori   
We'll get some answers eventually, so why not fight here while we wait? At least we'll get stronger.   
Sometimes you just gotta look at the bright side and do what you gotta do, y'know?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - You're totally missing my point, dude. I didn't mean getting faster, I meant getting psyched up.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Rather than think about this or that, we've got more to gain from knocking down a Shadow or two, right?   
Sure, we're in the dark now, but things will work out on their own, trust me.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Well, that's your call, but don't forget—sometimes you gotta ride the momentum.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Trust me, I totally get where you're coming from. One nasty plot twist, and we're suddenly back at square one.   
That said, I think we oughta put in effort to get stronger, so we'll be ready for anything.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Anyway, the choice is yours!   
Happy - Whether we press on or pull back, I've got your back, dude.   
   
   
-----   
   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Well done, everyone. That was a formidable opponent.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Heh, okay, my stunning performance aside, aren't all of us totally on the same wavelength now?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Let's not bring up your "stunning performance" ever... And I'd rather not be on the same wavelength as you, either.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Wha— Why not!? Teamwork makes the dream work, right?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Well, I guess you have a point... Let's keep up the good work, Arisato-kun.   
   
-----   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We're doing good work for a new team. Let's keep up the pace.   
Right now, Tartarus is our only lead to unravel the mystery behind the Dark Hour.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Alrighty! Then let's just keep on moving!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We can move on now, but the next floor doesn't look any different...   
Sad - You don't think it'll be the same old thing forever, do you...?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Only one way to find out.   
Maybe it will be.   
I can't say for sure.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Yeah, you're right. It's just... I want to at least feel like we're making progress.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I getcha, Yuka-tan. Spend too long in the Tartarus tartar sauce, and anybody'd be cravin' for barbecue.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - What the heck are you saying...? Well, at least you agree it's hard to push through the same thing over and over again.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Right. Part of our objective is to discover what lies ahead. All we can do now is keep moving forward.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
No point overthinking things now... All we gotta do is keep moving forward.   
Angry - ...After all, I've already made up my mind.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oh, look at you all fired up. What's gotten into you all of a sudden?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Oh, um... Nothing, really. Anyway, enough about me.   
We gotta keep going, right? C'mon, let's get a move on.   
   
-----   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - And another one bites the dust! We're on a roll, guys!   
Happy - While we're at it, how about we spice things up every now and then? Like by changin' up the leader...?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - What? I was worried about what you'd say next...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Don'tcha wanna see how I'd run this whole shebang? Well, don'tcha?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's do it.   
Should we switch?   
I'm fine with whatever.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Wait. It wouldn't be wise for a change in command in the middle of an expedition.   
We're making steady progress under Arisato's lead, so let's continue as we have been.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Fiiine, sure. I guess.   
Sad - But I'm pretty sure I could just take down the enemies here aaaaaall by myself...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Chill out, Junpei... If you're not careful, it won't be long till you get hurt.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Takeba's right. We can expect another strong enemy to appear.   
Don't let your guard down as we proceed.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Okaaay, whatever... Guess there's always next time.   
   
-----   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Phew... We won. Seems like we'll keep running into stronger enemies whenever we enter a new area.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Akihiko will also be back soon. We could always pick things up once he's ready to join us.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - I can't wait for Sanada-san to hop on board.   
Happy - Then we'll finally be a four-man band! You know, the standard for an RPG.   
Angry - Junpei Quest: The Legend of Junpei, Tower of Mystery! Now, let us head off, comrades!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - We don't need you to head off anywhere. Haven't you learned your lesson at all?   
Exasperated* - We need your head screwed on.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Whaddaya mean? I've got a perfectly good head on my shoulders!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - In that case, I suppose there's no need to worry about your studies?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Er, well, about that... Haha...   
Angry - Oh, Brave Knight Minato! Let us hurry and depart!   
   
-----   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You did an excellent job, especially against such a strong enemy.   
Happy - The same can be said about the battle with the large Shadow. I'm surprised at how fast you've all improved.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - It's definitely all natural-born talent! I think I'll make it all the way to the top at this rate!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - You always get so carried away... But if you're aiming for the top, I guess I'll tag along for the ride.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Heh, I see you're all as dependable as ever.   
Happy - There may not be a need for Akihiko or me to join your battles... Though Akihiko wouldn't be very happy about that.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Haha, I'd pay to see Sanada-san pouting. It'd be hilarious.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - That's rich, coming from you.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
What awaits us is an unknown frontier. All of you, proceed with caution.   
   
-----   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - *sigh* What's with these back-to-back fights?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Yeah, this is a first. It's like, pacing, anyone?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I can't get a read on a pattern for these floors... There's simply too much about which we're still in the dark.   
We need to prepare even more thoroughly, and retreat promptly when we're depleted.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Maybe we'd have an easier time with Sanada-senpai around.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Yeah... Wouldn't he be happy about fightin' a bunch of tough enemies anyways?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I can definitely see that... Nevertheless, he'd greatly increase our firepower.   
Well, if you plan on proceeding, then do so carefully. I'm counting on you.   
   
-----   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Nicely done. Doesn't seem like you're having any problems.   
Though I've never underestimated you in the first place, you're performing better than expected.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
We're in top form.   
We're not that great.   
You're making me blush.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Heheh! Now I'm gettin' pumped up! Ain't every day you get a compliment from Kirijo-senpai.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You— ...r— ...lly doin— ...well. I hav— ...hope— ...for you.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - ...Huh? Come again?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - You heard what she said... Stop fishing for more.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - N-No! I seriously couldn't hear her! There was, like, static or something.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Static...?   
...Check, check, one, two, one, two. How is it? Can you hear me?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, just fine.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Wha...? Was it just my imagination? Sorry, my bad.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
No, if you have any concerns, don't be afraid to relay them to me.   
For the time being, it seems there aren't any problems, so let's get back to exploring.   
   
-----   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I can't let my guard down... Especially not around those Gatekeepers.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
...I've never seen you with your guard down, though—not even in the dorm.   
When we're up late on a mission, I've never even seen you yawn, much less doze off.   
Then the next day, you're all dressed up and drinking black tea before heading to school fifteen minutes later.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
You're sure observant.   
I should follow her lead.   
Seems exhausting.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - Huh? Uh, no, not really. When you live in the same dorm, you start to pick some things up.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Once it becomes a habit, it's all second nature.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Besides... wouldn't you find it offensive if I were to take it easy?   
After all, I'm the one asking you all to attempt the impossible when taking part in these "club activities."   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - "Asking" us, huh...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...What's the matter?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Oh, um... Nothing.   
Sad - C'mon, Leader. We've beaten them, so let's move on. Hurry, clock's ticking!   
   
-----   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Gatekeeper eliminated. No other Shadow activity detected in the vicinity.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Roger that. Seems like we'll be able to take a small breather here.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - You sure look happy today, Mitsuru.   
Happy - Let me guess: you had a lot of stress pent up from being stuck as support this whole time?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Not at all. I was just thinking about how Yamagishi sounded so dependable.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - ...Huh? I do?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The connection is stable, and you accurately predict the Shadows' locations, too.   
You're exactly what we need. Don't you think so too, Arisato?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
She's a huge help.   
I miss your voice, though.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Y-You're exaggerating... Right now, I'm just trying to keep up with everyone.   
But... I'll do my best to meet your expectations!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Heh, even though I'm speaking right now? Though I should be glad you didn't say I was annoying.   
Happy - Rest assured, I'm perfectly capable of giving you an earful while on the front lines as well.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...Now that we're all rested, shall we keep going?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Okay, I've got your back, so let's move out once everyone's ready.   
   
-----   
   
Junpei Iori   
Hey, Minato, you've been at this nonstop, right?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Isn't that because Arisato-kun is the leader?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Well, we're all a team, so we can't just let him shoulder everything himself.   
Happy - Shouldn't we have someone step up to the plate whenever he takes a break? Say... like a second?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's a good idea.   
But we're doing just fine.   
Whatever.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - I know, right? I'm brilliant!   
Happy - So if we had to pick his right-hand man, then it'd obviously be me, since I was the first one to bring it up!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - You didn't even let the rest of us get a word in... I bet you were angling for this from the beginning, huh?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yeah, I think so too. Plus, I feel like I can always count on Arisato-kun... unlike someone else.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - ...Yo, why you gotta look at me when you say that!? This is blatant favoritism!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Dang, ice cold! C'mon, man, I was just thinkin' about what'd be best for you...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Yeah, right... You were actually just thinking about yourself. It was so obvious.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Anyway, if Arisato-kun wanted to rest, he could just take a break from exploring.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Oh... Huh, yeah. I guess that's true.   
Angry - But still, if you need a hand, I'll be happy to switch with you anytime, Minato. Sleep on it, alright?   
   
-----   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Booyah, nailed it! Now all the ladies say, "Yeeeah!"   
Happy - Man, if everyone could see me now, girls would be all over me...   
...But I guess that's not possible with the two of you around.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Ain't that right, my fellow Yakushima Rejects?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Don't give us such a weird nickname! I wasn't interested in picking up girls in the first place.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Welp, it's just good to know that nobody's perfect—not even Sanada-san.   
Happy - I feel like the three of us got a lot closer that day... Don't you feel it, too?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Our bond grew stronger.   
Sanada's not perfect?   
But I'm different from you.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - Hey... Are you sure you want to be lumped in together with Junpei?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Hey, whaddaya mean by that!? Ain't it great we're getting along?   
   
Junpei Iori   
What? Did you want him to be?   
Sad - If he were, then we'd just be two extras leeching off of his spotlight.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Exasperated* - ...Don't you have any pride?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - Wha—? Are you talking about Aigis? That doesn't count! It's not fair play!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Senpai, you're, like, dead serious, huh...? I guess a better word would be "real competitive."   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - But, hey, it's still summer! Meaning we got time to redeem ourselves, so why don't we sneak out at night or something and—   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - U-Um...   
Exasperated* - We can hear everything you've said... Yukari-chan and Kirijo-senpai, too.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Angry - ...That's enough small talk! Let's move out!   
   
-----   
   
Aigis   
Confirmed annihilation of enemy Shadow... We are victorious.   
Koromaru-san performed excellently as well. Once we return, we are to give you a reward, correct?   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Aigis   
What would best suffice as a reward for Koromaru-san?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
A delicious snack.   
A gentle brushing.   
He'll have to wait first.   
   
Koromaru   
*pant* *pant*   
   
Aigis   
Koromaru-san, you are drooling.   
Koromaru-san is exuberant. Perhaps he is "one hungry boy," as they say.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf!   
   
Aigis   
Koromaru-san says that he is concerned about the current state of his coat.   
Please do maintenance for him when you have the time.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!   
   
Aigis   
Koromaru-san says, in response to your heartless words, that he will continue to do his best.   
Is this what they call... the carrot and the whip?   
   
Aigis   
Well then, let us be off.   
I will also perform to the best of my ability in order to secure Koromaru-san the best possible reward.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
-----   
   
Ken Amada   
So everyone up until now has defeated lots of enemies like the one just now, right?   
When fighting enemies stronger than you... is there anything important to keep in mind?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
First, keep a level head.   
Determination is key.   
Well, there's a lot.   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - In other words... stay calm? Like the blue ranger?   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - Then... you're telling me to be bold, like the black ranger?   
   
Ken Amada   
Sad - That's true... But I have to train more and get stronger. There's not much time...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Amada-kun, there's no need to be worried. It's fine to start out slow and steady.   
   
Ken Amada   
Um... I appreciate your concern, but...   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
If he's saying he wants to get stronger, then let him do what he wants.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
He's long made up his mind. Since he's here and all.   
...Ain't that right?   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - Y-Yes...!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
There you have it. If you're really worried about him, then back him up.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - U-Understood...!   
Sorry, Amada-kun... Just let me know if you have trouble with anything.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Yes, of course! Thank you so much! I really do appreciate your support!   
   
-----   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looks like we're about to reach the 200th floor... Just how tall is this place?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
At the very least, there should be an end. As for when we'll get there? We'll just have to keep climbing and find out.   
Happy - ...What's wrong, Yukari? Are you tired?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Ahaha, does it look like I'm dying? Well, I'm just raring to go, be it 300 or 400 floors!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
That's encouraging.   
Let's get through this.   
300 floors? No thanks.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - It truly is. I've a thing or two to learn from you about perseverance.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Wait a second... Is that supposed to be a compliment? But you're the same way, Mitsuru-senpai.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - That's right. All we need is for Yukari to whip everyone into shape.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Yeah, no, I'm not doing that.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Heh, I know how you feel, but Yukari might get on your case, you know?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Geez, Mitsuru-senpai... You're making me out to be a total witch, but I think I'd be nicer than you.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Well then, wanna keep going, Arisato-kun? Maybe we'll discover something.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yukari's right. Let's keep advancing, even if only a step at a time.   
   
   
-----   
   
   
Junpei Iori   
I don't know about you guys, but having Senpai with us is real reassuring for these big fights.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Yes, he definitely knows the ins and outs of battle. You're a huge help here, Senpai.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Ah, you know I got your backs. I've got lost time to make up for, anyway.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Pleased to see you're back in fine fettle, Akihiko.   
But, keep in mind the situation's different now—we can't afford to lose you for an extended period again.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
No worries there. I've been stuck on the sidelines for long enough—I'm ready to get back out there.   
   
-----   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Scheming - All right, warm-up's over. Let's pick up the pace.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Huh? We were just warming up? This guy's a beast...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That went well enough. We've still got a ways to go, though.   
Don't slack off on the cooldown once we're back at the dorm, folks.   
It makes a world of difference in recovery speed.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Shoot, the other day, I was so zonked, I just passed out in my boxers on top of my bed...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - That sounds like you, Junpei... I'm surprised you didn't catch a cold.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Well, getting told by a seasoned vet like Senpai actually has some weight to it.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - *chuckle* A "seasoned vet," huh?   
That reminds me of a story from before you all came to the dorm. A certain person who, after an intense workout in his room...   
Happy - Passed out from exhaustion, drenched in sweat, then woke up with a raging fever.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Sad - Th-That was just— I passed out while still wearing my socks!   
Surprised - That's enough gabbing, anyway! Let's keep moving, Arisato...   
   
-----   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Sad - *sigh* What's with these back-to-back fights?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Yeah, this is a first. It's like, pacing, anyone?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I can't get a read on a pattern for these floors... There's simply too much about which we're still in the dark.   
We need to prepare even more thoroughly, and retreat promptly when we're depleted.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We're really pushing the pace on your first day back. Are you holding up all right, Sanada-senpai?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - Yeah. Pretty creepy place, huh? I'm actually trembling right now... I can't wait for the next fight.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - You're smirking!? What are you, the main character in a fighting manga!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Good grief... You don't change, do you, Akihiko?   
Arisato, you're our leader—be sure to stay vigilant.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right, take out the Gatekeeper agai—   
   
We'll need— ...our way thro— ...here, unti—   
   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Huh? Kirijo-senpai? You're breaking up on us...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sorry about that. Testing, one, two, one, two...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Okay, it's back to normal. Having any trouble on your end?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
We're pretty high up—the signal must be getting spotty.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - What do we do if we get cut off? Kirijo-senpai's sorta like our lifeline here...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hmm...   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Recon isn't really in the wheelhouse of Mitsuru's Persona.   
She manages well enough through supplemental equipment, but even that has its limitations...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sorry to give you cause for concern...   
That being said, our equipment still has a bit more range to spare, so that shouldn't be a problem.   
I'll try to figure out the connection issues on my end.   
You all go ahead and keep exploring for now.   
   
-----   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Your skills are still sharp as ever, Aragaki.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Ah, nah... Spare me the flattery.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - I mean, there's some heavy rust for sure, but that's also comparing you to how much stronger I've gotten.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Angry - Oh? You care to try me?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's take it easy...   
Play nice, you two.   
Now, that I'd like to see.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Tell him, not me—this knucklehead's the one picking a fight.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That's rich, getting called a knucklehead by the king of the knuckleheads.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Angry - What are you, a kindergartener!?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Great. The last thing I need's you ridin' the coattails of this knucklehead.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That's rich, getting called a knucklehead by the king of the knuckleheads.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Angry - What are you, a kindergartener!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Exasperated* - *sigh*   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Let's call it a draw for now, you two. I know you have a history together...   
But any fool who can't act his age is ripe for execution.   
Angry - Now, which one of you wants to be first?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Tch... Fine, whatever. Let's get going, Arisato.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hold it—I'm not finished talking.   
I expect a relapse prevention report from both of you for hindering club activities.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Surprised - Wha—!? How many pages this time...?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Surprised - The hell, you're actually gonna write it!? I'm not writing any stupid report.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Sorry for the delay, Arisato...   
I'll give them a more comprehensive talking-to later. For now, let's just keep moving.   
   
-----   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Whew, we won! These enemies keep getting tougher.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Yeah, but it's an easy win with Aragaki-senpai, right? I mean, watchin' him, you wouldn't know he just got back from leave...   
He's so badass without lookin' like he's even tryin' to be. How do you think he got like that, huh?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I wish I knew.   
With age.   
Something outside your reach.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - Interesting... You want to be more like Aragaki-senpai, Arisato-kun?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Angry - Hey, I asked first! Don't copy the personality I'm copying!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Quit obsessin' over something so stupid.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Hoo-boy! That means one day, I'll be oozing with manliness too...!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Uh-huh, sure... Give it a good fifty years or so.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Ugh, you make me sound like I belong in a geriatric ward... We've only got a year's difference between us.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - True that. Junpei'll grow moldy before he gets anywhere close to being like that.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Moldy!? Excuse me, I'm still plenty fresh!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
This shit never gets old to you guys, does it...?   
Huh...   
You guys must be what's makin' the crew feel so different this time around...   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - Hmm? Did you say something, Aragaki-senpai?   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Nah, ignore me.   
We've still got work here, don't we? Let's get movin'.   
   
-----   
   
Aigis   
As we presumed, the higher we ascend, the stronger the enemies are.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf arf!   
   
Aigis   
Indeed, we must remain vigilant.   
However, the fortuitous return of Aragaki-san has bolstered our forces.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf!   
   
Aigis   
Yes, exactly as you say, Koromaru-san.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Hey, Arisato...   
Are those two actually holdin' a real conversation?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Yeah, they can communicate.   
It's just an act she pulls.   
Don't ask me.   
   
Koromaru   
Woof woof!   
   
Aigis   
Just as Koromaru-san says, we are besties—we understand each other perfectly.   
   
Koromaru   
Sad - *whine*   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Surprised - Oh, huh... Wait, you really do understand each other, right?   
   
Aigis   
I can answer that. We dance to the same beat, in a manner of speaking.   
Though, whose beat we dance to remains to be determined.   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf arf!   
   
Aigis   
Koromaru-san is saying, "I'm glad Aragaki-san came with us."   
He also said, "Aragaki-san is not only a force in battle, but also very kind to me at the dorm."   
And, "Why, just the other day, he secretly cooked me a full meal—"   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
Surprised - ...!   
Hey, Arisato, story time's over. Let's go.   
Angry - ...I said let's go!

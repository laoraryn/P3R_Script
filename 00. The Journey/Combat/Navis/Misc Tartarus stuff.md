Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hold on! There's a Shadow up ahead.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Another Shadow up ahead. Let's get you more accustomed to combat.   
Angry - The battle's about to begin! Everyone, stay focused!   
   
Junpei Iori   
The heck? Hey, I found some kinda boxy-lookin' thing.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Yes, boxes like those seem to be scattered all throughout Tartarus.   
Sometimes they contain useful items for battle. Seek them out as often as you can.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Oh sweet, so they're basically like treasure chests!   
Happy - Hell yeah! Let's bust it open and see what's inside!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Surprised - Hey, c'mon! Aren't you dyin' to know what's inside!?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Shadow detected.   
Looks like they haven't noticed you yet. Now's your chance.   
Try sneaking up on them from behind! Make sure you stay out of their field of vision.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Wait, the enemy's going to see you! Fall back for now!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...You almost gave yourself away to the enemy.   
Don't let your guard down just because you have some combat experience now.   
Fortunately, the enemy hasn't noticed you yet. Try getting them from behind again!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I detect another Shadow up ahead.   
Take advantage of what you just learned. Try not to alert the enemy as you move.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The goal today is to gain experience in battle! Running away is not an option.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I hope you're not tired yet because it's time to step it up.   
Now approach the enemy from behind, carefully.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Hey, I found some stairs!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Wait! We're looking for the teleporter, aren't we?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Exactly what Takeba said. Please prioritize getting back safely for now.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Wait, don't waste this chance. Try opening that box.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That reaction... Do you have a **Twilight Fragment** with you?   
Try holding it up to the treasure chest.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looks like you found a teleporter.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Now use it to return to the entrance.

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - That Shadow... It looks like there's something wrong with it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Huh... It seems to be having trouble finding its footing. It almost looks drunk.   
   
---   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm not sure exactly why, but that Shadow seems to be intimidated by us...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
But please don't let your guard down! It may still strike if we give it an opening.   
   
---   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
That Shadow seems especially aggressive, doesn't it?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm not sure why, but it appears to be agitated.   
It's fast, but not well coordinated. Stay calm and dodge, and you should be fine.   
   
---   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh, look at that!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There may be items worth gathering on this floor, so keep an eye out.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - Over there! Be careful—you're not alone!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It's hard to see anything in this darkness, but that goes for the enemy as well.

Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'm ready.   
Let's not fight yet.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - It's a strong enemy! Are you ready to fight it?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - You'll have to defeat this enemy to move on... Are you ready?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - It's a very powerful enemy! Please make sure you're fully prepared for battle!   
   
---   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - I'm picking up on a large group of enemies ahead!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Even if you took a detour, it's unlikely you'd be able to avoid them entirely...   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Let's just press through, then.   
We'll be fine—we have Fuuka.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Sad - Please wait! It could be dangerous without a plan...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um, I appreciate your confidence in me, but I mostly just locate enemies...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Hm... Actually, I may be able to help out here!   
Happy - I'm going to use my **Jamming** skill!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
**Jamming** obstructs enemy detection, making it harder for them to find you.   
In other words, enemies shouldn't attack you even if you enter their line of sight.   
It won't always work on all enemies, but for these ones here...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - Help me, Lucia...!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - Help me, Juno...!   
   
---   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - *gasp* There it is!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Is this... a door? Could you please get a little closer to it for me?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Um, is something wrong? The door isn't that way.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Uh, please wait! There are only stairs up ahead.   
I really think we should figure out what's going on, so please come back for now.   
   
---   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Wait! Is that Shadow up ahead a...!?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Please wait a moment! The Shadow up ahead might be a...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Well, now... That Shadow took off like a bandit, didn't it?   
Those ones are fairly rare... I suppose we can simply call them "rare Shadows."   
They can be tough to catch, but the potential rewards are worth the trouble.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It seems to have turned left up ahead. Why don't you try tracking it down?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Wow, it took off quickly, didn't it?   
I believe that's an unusual breed called a "rare Shadow."   
They're real fast on the run, but catching them apparently yields big rewards.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It looks like it made a left up ahead. Would you mind pursuing it?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Is something the matter? Track down that rare Shadow before it gets away.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Please try tracking down that rare Shadow first.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Ah, it seems to have escaped... I told you it'd be tough to catch, didn't I?   
Well, the next time you see one, I want you to try engaging it in battle.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, it got away... They really are fast, aren't they?   
If you see one again, try your best to catch up to it and fight it.   
   
---   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
There's a Shadow up ahead...   
I'll take this opportunity to teach you about Shifting.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I see. So, basically, we're working together to battle more effectively!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Aw snap! It'd be sweet if we could pull this kinda thing off a lot, huh?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
In combat, you should be as coordinated as possible. Put it to good use.   
   
---   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - Wait!   
Angry - There's an enemy nearby, but...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - It's in a league of its own, far different from the run-of-the-mill Shadows in this area.   
Angry - This will be a tough fight. If you're not feeling confident, then don't engage in combat.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - Should we enter battle, retreat is a viable option.   
Angry - We need a leader capable of making level-headed decisions so we don't end up in dire straits.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - ...Hang on!   
Angry - I'm sensing an enemy nearby, but, um...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - This Shadow seems a bit tougher than the other ones in this area.   
Angry - It'll be a tough fight, so if you think you can't handle it, try to avoid combat.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
If you do get caught, it'd be wise to retreat immediately.   
And, most importantly, please don't make any reckless decisions. We need you to keep a calm head.

Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's too dangerous to go alone. Come back and choose teammates to fight at your side.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It's not safe to go alone. Please come back and form a party!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Anything could happen. Keep your guard up.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Keep an eye out and be ready for anything.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I don't detect any enemies on this floor. I believe you'll be safe for now.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I don't sense any enemies around. You should be safe on this floor.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The path forward has opened. Exercise caution as you proceed.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Looks like we can keep going.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You should be able to progress further... Could you take a closer look?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Has the path opened up yet? Could you please get closer and check it out?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looks like you can't progress any further. Let's wait for the right time before we try again.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I don't think it's possible to go any farther than this for now... I guess all we can do now is wait.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Keep a lookout for the enemy that escaped earlier.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Try to look for the enemy that escaped earlier!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
What is it?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Do you need my help?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Did you need something?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
All right. Are you sure you want to return to the entrance right now?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Roger that! Then please stay put.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm sorry, but... it looks like my ability can't be used there.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
All right. You want information on this floor, correct?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Okay, I'll run a search and display what information I can find, then.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm sorry, but... it looks like my ability can't be used there.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We've already gathered all the information we can on this floor, so there's no need for that.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
All right. You don't want to be detected by the enemies on this floor, right?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Okay! This won't work on all enemies, so please exercise caution.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm sorry, but... looks like this won't have any effect there.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Jamming is still in effect, so we don't need to activate it again!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
All right. You want to boost your defense and speed, right?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Okay! Just keep in mind that these boons will only take effect in the next battle.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
That's still in effect right now, so we don't have to activate it again. It'll show during the next battle!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
All right. You want to scare all the enemies on this floor, right?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Okay, here goes nothing!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm sorry, but... looks like this won't have any effect there.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I've already used Shock Noise on this floor.   
It may not affect any more enemies. Are you sure you want to use it again?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm sorry, but I don't have enough energy...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Do you need anything else?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Defeat all the Shadows on the floor.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Since there aren't any enemies at the moment, there's no need to issue that order.   
Now's a good time to instruct your party members to split up.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
There are no enemies left to defeat. Use the teleporter to return to the entrance.

DEV: Display help on instructions to split up at this time.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm worried about the passengers, too. That's why we must secure the monorail immediately.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Fortunately, no one on the monorail was hurt...   
But why hasn't the enemy attacked us yet? Does that mean they're not attacking at random?   
I'm not sure what the enemy is thinking... so proceed with caution.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Was the enemy waiting for this opportunity?   
Angry - It's too dangerous for Iori to be alone! Go after him!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - There's no time! Get to the front!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - I can tell that the monorail has sped up from where I am, too!   
Angry - If it gets any faster, there won't be much time left until a collision!   
Angry - Concentrate on getting to the front, defeating the enemy, and stopping the train immediately!   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
I can't contact Mitsuru. All I hear is static...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There's an enemy close by. Be careful!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I still sense some enemies nearby. Keep an eye out if you decide to engage them.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Looks like you've defeated all the Shadows on this floor. Please look for the stairs that'll take you up.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Something feels off on the floor above us... If you're going up, proceed with caution.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The target is on the third floor. Please hurry!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Good job. It should be safe for you to return now.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Be careful! There seems to be a Shadow in that room still.   
But... where is it?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'll see what I can find out, so please join up with the others for now.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I sense something similar to a Shadow coming from the mirror.   
Please break the mirror!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There should be something different about the mirrors we're looking for... Take a closer look and see if you can find out what it is.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Break any mirror that doesn't show your own reflection!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The seal is broken! Head to the target right away!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm picking up two powerful readings from our target somewhere below you...   
It's like the two signals are overlapping, forming one giant mass.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The target is heading downward.   
Angry - Please go after it!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - The target is waiting at the end.   
Angry - Please be careful!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The furthest you've gotten is floor .   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I believe the highest you've gotten is floor .   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - The Reaper has appeared! Retreat immediately!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - The Reaper showed up! Please run!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - These readings...!? It's getting closer!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - I sense something powerful, and it's approaching quickly!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There's someone on this floor! Please rescue them!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There's something on this floor. It's... a person? Please look for them!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Looks like one of those doors is on this floor. Maybe we should go look for it.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Something different is happening on this floor. Stay alert.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There's something different about this floor. Please be careful.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The path forward has opened up. Exercise caution as you proceed.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Looks like there's more to this path. Let's keep going.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You should be able to progress further... Could you take a closer look?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Has the path opened up yet? Could you please get closer and check it out?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looks like you can't progress any further. Let's wait for the right time before we try again.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I don't think it's possible to go any farther than this for now... I guess all we can do now is wait.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The enemy has been annihilated. Let's move on.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You've already defeated the enemy here. Let's get moving!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I sense a powerful enemy up ahead. Make sure you're well-prepared before entering battle.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There's an enemy blocking the path up ahead, and a tough one at that. Get ready for battle.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I'm picking up a human presence on the 263rd floor. It must be the last member of Strega.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I sense someone on the 259th floor. I'm positive it's a member of Strega... Please be careful.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We finally did it... We finally conquered this enormous tower.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Looks like the last member of Strega, the leader, is on the 263rd floor.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We've finally made it to the top of Tartarus... where we'll have our final battle.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We've almost reached the end of this area. Let's press on.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We're almost at the end of this area! Just hang on, everyone!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
We've made decent progress in this area, but we still have a bit of ground to cover.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We've made a lot of progress. Just a little more, and we'll reach the next area!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You've defeated the stronger enemies in this area, but there's still a ways to go until you reach the end of it.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You've cleared out all of the powerful enemies in this area. Let's try to get as close as we can to the next area.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
There's a strong enemy nearby. Brace yourself for battle.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I sense a strong enemy close by! It might be a good idea to prepare for battle.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I'm getting readings from a strong enemy. We're still far from it, but don't let your guard down.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I sense a strong enemy a little further up... Please take care when exploring.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looks like it'll be some time until we cross paths with the next strong enemy. Tread carefully.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It'll be a while until we encounter the next strong enemy, but please remain vigilant while exploring.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I sense someone on the 259th floor! I think it's a member of Strega, so please be careful!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I sense a person on the 263rd floor... It must be Takaya. Looks like it's time to settle the score with him.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We're nearly at the top floor... And then it'll be time for our final battle.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I sense something completely new... It doesn't seem to be a Shadow.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It's a huge door... I wonder what we'll find inside.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Please return for now. I'd like to go over the information we have on the door.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The atmosphere here feels different from the usual floors we explore... Please proceed carefully.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Let's investigate the door. Maybe we can figure out what makes this one different from the rest.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The tension is so thick, it's almost suffocating...   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
I can sense Strega's presence just up ahead. Please proceed with caution.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There's another person on the 263rd floor... It must be the other member of Strega.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Seems like the leader of Strega is just up ahead.

Mitsuru Kirijo   
There seems to be a person on this floor. Are you going to leave without them?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right, let's go.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Someone is still on this floor! Are you sure you're going to move on?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
...Okay, we'll keep going.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Wait. There could be more troublesome foes waiting ahead.   
Go ahead with the others. You should keep at least one other person with you.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - Something feels different about the floor up ahead!   
I sense something more potent... like a tangible force of will. Stay alert.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - The floor ahead feels different from the others!   
Whatever's there is more powerful than anything before. Be careful.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo - DESC_FLOOR21_NG_MITU   
Hold on a moment... All right, the path ahead is safe.   
...And I'm curious what's on the next floor. Please continue forward.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi - DESC_FLOOR21_NG_FUKA   
Please wait just a second... Okay, it seems safe past here.   
I'd like to know what's on the next floor. Would it be okay with you to keep going?

Fuuka Yamagishi   
Don't worry, we'll keep them safe at the entrance until you decide to leave for the night.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - If you find any more missing people, please rescue them as quickly as you can.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Don't worry, we'll keep the kitty safe at the entrance until you decide to leave for the night.   
So you can keep exploring, if you want.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - I tried searching again, but I don't sense any more people inside.   
Happy - I think we rescued everyone that had wandered in here. Thank goodness...

Now then, to business. How might I help you?   
   
Elizabeth   
Do you require further assistance?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
About requests...   
Let's talk.   
No, thank you.   
   
Elizabeth   
If you are in need of anything, please do not hesitate to ask it of me.   
   
Elizabeth   
If you wish to fulfill a request, please speak with me for more detailed information.   
Once you have completed a designated request, I ask that you report back to me at your earliest convenience.   
Please be mindful that some requests may have deadlines, and must be completed within a set time limit.   
   
Elizabeth   
I would like to inform you...   
There has been a recent change in Tartarus.   
It seems that a path that had been blocked off is now open.   
...I wish you a safe journey.   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
Elizabeth said that a previously   
blocked path is now open.   
I should check it out next   
time I go to Tartarus.   
   
---   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hold on.   
It's not safe to continue any further. Check that device over there.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
I know you're eager to go on, but use that device to return here for now.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Please wait!   
It's dangerous to keep going. Could you go take a look at that device over there?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Please come back for now. You should be able to use that device to return.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
You're doing great, but I'm sure that last battle must have worn you out some.   
If you continue on now, there's no telling when you'll find another teleporter.   
Since there's one right here, I suggest you make use of it and stop for a break.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
It looks like you can move forward now, but are you tired from that last battle?   
If you keep going, I don't know when you'll encounter another teleporter.   
Happy - I think it would be good to use the one here to return to the entrance for now.

You're approaching a Shadow! Get ready for battle!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Roger that. I'm always ready.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Leader, are you ready?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Uhh, should we really be just ignoring the enemy?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Okay, let's go!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
There are still Shadows on this floor. Please defeat them before moving on.   
   
---   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
The Shadow has been eliminated.   
I don't sense any other enemies nearby. Let's keep moving.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The Shadow has been defeated.   
I'm not sensing any other enemies. Let's move on.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Wait, the Shadow is making a move...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Exasperated* - ...I don't sense it anymore. It seems it ran away.   
There don't appear to be other enemies around either. Well, let's keep moving.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - Oh! I'm sensing movement from the Shadow!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Exasperated* - ...I don't detect it anymore. I guess it ran away...   
There don't seem to be any other enemies around here, so let's move on.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Surprised - What!? It's ransacking the treasure chest!   
A Shadow that goes after treasure chests... I wonder why...   
Also, it may be a coincidence, but there are more chests than usual on this floor.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - It's... stealing from the treasure chest!?   
Why would a Shadow do that? I wonder if it's searching for something...   
Oh, and there are more chests than usual on this floor. Is that just a coincidence?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
More chests, huh?   
Just a "coincidence"?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Hm... It would seem that the Shadow came specifically for the treasure chests.   
If that's the case, we could take advantage of its obsession with treasure.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Well, by the looks of it... the Shadow came here for those treasure chests.   
If it loves treasure so much, maybe we could use that to our advantage!   
   
SYS_HIGHRARE_STEAL_00   
Greedy Shadows appear on floors with many treasure chests. They will scurry around and open the treasure chests one after another.   
They are quick and nearly impossible to catch on foot. Take advantage of their obsession and intercept them on their way to treasure chests.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
First, look for a treasure chest that the Shadow has yet to get its hands on.   
If we take its beloved treasure first, it will likely try to come after us.   
Once it gets close, we'll be able to strike!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
First, find a treasure chest that the Shadow hasn't gotten to yet.   
It might come looking for us if we take the treasure it was after.   
If it does, then we'll have a chance to fight it!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Are you giving up on catching that Shadow?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right, then. Carry on.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, are you done trying to catch that Shadow?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Okay, keep trying, then. You can do it!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I won't give up!   
I guess I should keep trying.   
   
---   
   
Minato Arisato - Thoughts   
The path to the next floor is blocked off...   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It seems to continue on upwards, but the path is blocked...   
Looks like there's no way to progress any further right now, so let's stop here for tonight.   
Happy - We've still managed to cover a lot of ground. Well done, everyone.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
UNUSED   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Guess that's it, then. But how are we gonna get past this roadblock?   
   
Junpei Iori   
Tartarus changes every day, right? So maybe it won't be blocked off tomorrow night, or somethin'.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Unfortunately, that logic doesn't seem to apply here.   
Some floors have fixed structures and layouts. This appears to be one of them.   
Some other factor may have caused this. I'll look into it.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Guess we just gotta wait. C'mon, let's bounce, Minato.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looks like we still won't be able to proceed after all.   
No need to rush, however. I'm sure the path will open at some point.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
UNUSED   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Looks like this is the end of the line... How much more do we have to explore after this?   
Well, not like we're gonna unlock it by dwelling on it. All we gotta do now is wait.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Sad - Couldn't we just bring a ladder or something? But it'd be a pretty nasty fall if we slipped, huh...   
Happy - Guess we'll just have to wait and see. You'll just have to witness my mad skills next time!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It looks like we can't proceed any further. I'm sure the opportunity will present itself in time.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We can't go any further than this. Looks like we'll just have to wait.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
We hit a dead end... What now? Should we stop for tonight?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
I wonder why it's blocked off now when it's just gonna open up later...   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Whew, what a climb! C'mon, let's head back and grab some grub.   
   
Junpei Iori   
I mean, who knows when it'll open up? How the heck does it even work anyways?   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
This is as far as we can go, huh. Guess it's time to head back.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Even if we can't press forward right now, we have plenty more to do.   
Like gaining combat experience. If we train now, we'll be ready for what comes later.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Looks like this is as far as we can go for now. It's a good mark of our progress.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's strange. I've come to accept that it's the tower stopping us like this. This place is really unfathomable.   
It's almost as if it's luring us in... Am I overthinking it?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Koro-chan, that's the furthest we can go for now. We did a good job.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Koro-chan, well done. Good work.   
   
Aigis   
It seems we can't proceed now. Let's wait for the time to come.   
   
Aigis   
It's frustrating, but "good things come with waiting," as they say.   
   
Ken Amada   
There's nothing we can do if the path is blocked. Shall we turn in for the night?   
   
Ken Amada   
Looks like we've hit a stopping point. Does that mean we're taking a break from Tartarus for a bit?   
But, I guess we could still come back and train up by fighting the Shadows.   
   
Koromaru   
*whine*   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
We're just gonna have to wait. Time for ya to head to bed.   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
A dead end... Tch, wasting our time like this...   
Just gotta wait it out.   
   
Aigis   
It's frustrating, but as the saying goes, "Good things come to those who wait."   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
UNUSED   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Looks like we can't go any further than this... The path will probably only open on the Promised Day...   
Let's wait for January 31st while we prepare for the final battle.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Is there anything else we can do for now? ...I don't want to have any regrets.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Scheming - You'll be waiting for us beyond this point, won't you? Ryoji... We're on our way.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Now, all we have to do... is prepare ourselves for the moment, with no regrets.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
...There's still some time. We should do whatever we can.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Koro-chan seems to understand that we need to prepare ourselves for what's to come.   
   
Aigis   
This is as far as we can go for now, until the Promised Day. And what awaits us then...   
Angry - I can hardly imagine. Still, let's do everything we can.   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - Arisato-san, please let me know if there's anything I can do to help!   
   
Koromaru   
Arf!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
UNUSED   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - What're these tremors...? Watch out!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Is it over? What was that...?   
It's one thing just to know Tartarus changes daily, but to actually see it transform before our very own eyes...   
Regardless, the path has opened. Let's try exploring further beyond that.   
As for our next goal... I can only assume there'll be a similar obstruction up ahead.   
Let's aim for that. I'm counting on you.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Surprised - These vibrations...! Please watch out!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
The blocked path opened up...! Now we can move forward!   
Sad - But, I wonder how it works... Tartarus is full of mysteries.   
The labyrinth continues on beyond this point.   
There'll probably be a similar obstruction further up.   
Let's aim to reach that next!   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Exasperated* - Argh, I wish it wouldn't start shaking all of a sudden. My heart almost stopped...   
I'm worried about what else could be in store for us down the road... But since the path opened up, I guess we gotta press on.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - That was kinda exciting. It was almost like watching a giant robot transform!   
Happy - I wonder what other gimmicks we'll see. Anyways, let's keep going.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
That was quite a contraption. What was its purpose...?   
Hm, no point dwelling on it. All I need to do is keep moving forward.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Now, we can proceed further. It will only grow more treacherous from here.   
We'll need to be on high alert. We're counting on you, Arisato.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Did that surprise you too, Koro-chan? We'll be counting on you, too!   
   
Aigis   
The change in structure was so surprising, I "jumped out of the skin," as they say.   
...Although, I don't fully understand that expression. Anyway, we should proceed on.   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - It was a huge shock when the path started moving. I wonder how it works...   
Surprised - Oh, not that I thought it was cool or anything!   
   
Koromaru   
Arf! Arf!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
At least we can move on, yeah, but don't you think we're taking it a little slow?   
Shouldn't we be picking up the pace a little? Either way, I'll leave it up to you.   
   
Aigis   
I didn't expect the structure to change. My "jaw dropped."   
...Which is to say I was extremely surprised. Anyway, we should hurry on ahead.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Angry - Here it comes! Stay away from the stairs!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Great. Now we can continue onward.   
Expect the enemies to grow stronger. Stay alert, everyone.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Angry - Here it is...! Please watch out!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Looks like the shaking has subsided. Is everyone all right?   
The path towards the staircase has opened up. You can advance further now.   
We don't know what's waiting ahead, so please be careful going forward.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
All right, let's go. I wonder what the next area's gonna be like.   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - Stay tuned for more from the mighty Junpei!   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
...Made it to the next stage. Let's see how far my fists can carry me.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's thanks to all of you that we've made it this far.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Koro-chan is all pumped up too. You can do it, Koro-chan!   
   
Aigis   
It must take an enormous amount of energy to move a structure that large.   
Although, such physical laws might not apply here.   
   
Ken Amada   
Angry - Another new area beyond this point, huh? I wonder what we'll find there...   
   
Koromaru   
Arf, arf!

They are quick and nearly impossible to catch on foot. Take advantage of their obsession and intercept them on their way to treasure chests.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
First, look for a treasure chest that the Shadow has yet to get its hands on.   
If we take its beloved treasure first, it will likely try to come after us.   
Once it gets close, we'll be able to strike!   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
First, find a treasure chest that the Shadow hasn't gotten to yet.   
It might come looking for us if we take the treasure it was after.   
If it does, then we'll have a chance to fight it!   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Are you giving up on catching that Shadow?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right, then. Carry on.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Oh, are you done trying to catch that Shadow?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Okay, keep trying, then. You can do it!   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I won't give up!   
I guess I should keep trying.

Junpei Iori   
Happy - How'd ya like our all-out combo attack, ya filthy Shadows!?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Surprised - When I saw my opening, it's like my body just knew what to do.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
That was magnificent teamwork. It's hard to believe it's your first time.   
As you grasp the flow of battle, you'll learn to coordinate with each other seamlessly.   
Let's apply what we've learned so far and continue exploring.   
   
---   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Okay, I think this is a good place to stop.   
There's a device nearby that will teleport you back. Look around for it.   
There should also be some stairs nearby, but I can't approve any more exploration right now.   
We'll explore the upper floors next time.

Fuuka Yamagishi   
I no longer detect any Shadows. All the ones on this floor have been defeated.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
It's all coming back to me. It would be wise for me to keep battling.   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Let's keep going then.   
   
---   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
You've already found the stairs, right? Should we head there now?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
Head for the stairs   
Continue exploring   
   
---   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right, we've secured the perimeter.   
We still have a little time before the Shadows reappear.   
It might be a good idea to do some reconnaissance.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Nice work. We've secured the perimeter.   
We still have some time to spare before the Shadows reappear.   
It should be a little safer for you to scout ahead right now.   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
What do you mean?   
What should we do?   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
One of you will split from the group to canvass the floor.   
That way, we'll be able to explore more efficiently, correct?   
It's still risky, of course, but one person should have an easier time avoiding Shadows.   
If the scout can find the stairs, it'll lighten the load for Arisato and the main squad.   
So how about it? Anyone up to the task?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
One person will split from the party to scout the floor.   
Exploring would be more efficient if we divide and conquer.   
Exasperated* - Going solo makes it easier to evade Shadows as well.   
And if the scout can locate the stairs, it'd make everyone's lives a lot easier.   
So what do you think? Should we ask someone to scout ahead?   
   
---   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
All right, we've secured the area. Shall we have someone scout ahead?   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
We've secured the area. Do you want to send someone out to scout ahead?   
   
Yukari Takeba   
Happy - I'm on it! Just let me handle this!   
   
Junpei Iori   
Happy - C'mon, dude. You know I'm the man for the job.   
   
Akihiko Sanada   
Happy - I'll go. My training's prepared me for this.   
   
Mitsuru Kirijo   
Happy - Allow me. Don't worry, I'll clear us a path.   
   
Fuuka Yamagishi   
Happy - Oh, I think Koro-chan's volunteering to go! Well then, we're counting on you, Koro-chan.   
   
Aigis   
I'll go. I have experience conducting solo missions.   
   
Ken Amada   
Happy - Leave it to me! There's no way those Shadows will find me!   
   
Koromaru   
Happy - Arf, arf!   
   
Shinjiro Aragaki   
I got this. You cool with that?   
   
Minato Arisato - Selection   
I'm counting on you.   
Let's not.
